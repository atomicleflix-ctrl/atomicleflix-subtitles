263
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd be in separate rooms, though?</font>

264
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not the problem!</font>

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's cheesecake, Baumkuchen, 
stuff with cream on top,</font>

267
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">stuff with cream inside, 
cheesecake and more!</font>

270
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, my bad, my bad.</font>

271
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, that was good.</font>

273

297
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's stay like this for a while.</font>

302
