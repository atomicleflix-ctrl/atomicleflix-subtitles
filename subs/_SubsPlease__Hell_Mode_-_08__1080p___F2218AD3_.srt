72
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">we've decided to assign you a new position.</font>

73
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The huntsman has two duties:</font>

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">First, hunting monsters
to provide food for the family.</font>

75
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And second, rescuing townsfolk
from any monster attacks.</font>

76
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Basically, a hunter employed by the baron.</font>

77

78
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, like, I can just go hunting for monsters
every day and call it work?</font>

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course, we don't expect you to do it for free.</font>

80
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You will receive 100 silver coins,
which is double your current monthly wage.</font>

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,210

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They'd rather give me a fixed salary instead
of paying per monster like they did before.</font>

83
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Since a white deer is definitely worth
more than 100 silver coins.</font>

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hm? Not to your liking?</font>

85
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No! It sounds great!</font>

86
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is the best deal I could ask for!</font>

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All I have to do is hunt enough monsters
to provide the necessary meat,</font>

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">then I'm free to spend
the rest of my time farming goblins!</font>

89
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Man! I'm practically drooling at the thought!</font>

90
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I understand. I'll gladly take on
the title of huntsman.</font>

need to work as a huntsman once a week or so.</font>

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I hope Mash and Myulla are doing okay back home.</font>

137
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gotcha!</font>

138
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Nice. That fills my quota.</font>

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Time to pack it in for the day.</font>

140
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shucks, Allen!</font>

141
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Another big haul today!</font>

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow.</font>

143
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You even got the big toad I asked for!</font>

144
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course, Head Chef!</font>

145
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This will put a smile
on Master Mihai's face for sure.</font>

146
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Guess what, Allen? Master Mihai and Sir Zenoff
are actually having a duel right now!</font>

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow! This is the first time I've seen
Sir Zenoff using his sword.</font>

148
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mihai's really holding his own against him.</font>

149
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's leave it at that.</font>

150
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your skills have become much sharper
in the past year, young lad.</font>

151
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you.</font>

152

being called a "young lad."</font>

153
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, Allen. You're back?</font>

154
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's quite the haul.</font>

155
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Impressive, Allen!</font>

156
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Since you're so tough,
I'd love to spar with you for a bit.</font>

157
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,880

158
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,920

235
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,170

238
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, that's because I cleared
a dungeon over the summer.</font>

239
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dungeon?</font>

240
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's like a maze where you fight monsters.</font>

241
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I needed to clear it
or I would've gotten expelled.</font>

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Really?! No wonder you couldn't
come home over the summer.</font>

243
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Clearing a dungeon
for summer homework? That's sick!</font>

244
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Life at the Academy is rough, but it's worth it.</font>

245
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For example, I had the opportunity
to learn the intricacies of swordsmanship</font>

246
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">from Dverg the Sword Lord.</font>

247
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow, from Lord Dverg himself?!</font>

248
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Neat. Sounds like a stacked teaching staff.</font>

249
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's amazing! What was he like?</font>

250
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hm, how can I put it...</font>

251
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now I get it. He trained
with Sword Lords and cleared dungeons.</font>

252
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Plus, being on normal mode
means that he progresses 100 times faster</font>

253
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">than I do on Hell Mode.</font>

254
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So this is how strong
someone with a talent can get</font>

255
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">by dedicating a whole year to leveling up, huh?</font>

256
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Tell me, Mihai! When will you come visit us again?</font>

257
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not until summer of next year, most likely.</font>

258
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Boo...</font>

259
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please spar with me again when you do!</font>

260
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sure thing.</font>

261
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But take good care of my sister
while I'm away, would you?</font>

262
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sound good, Allen?</font>

263
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Uh, yeah.</font>

264
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Screw that.</font>

265
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm trying to rise the servant ranks
and make a name for myself.</font>

266
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I had my way, I'd be out hunting every day!</font>

267
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,920

268
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I gotta figure out a way to quit this gig
without shaming my dad in the process...</font>

269
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A few days later,
Mihai left to return to Academy City.</font>

270
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's where Krena, Dogora,
and eventually Cecil will go.</font>

271
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,750

314

are filled with mithril deposits.</font>

315
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There are multiple mines in both territories,</font>

316
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but because the white dragon
has made its nest on this side,</font>

is going through an economic downturn, huh?</font>

319
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,790

320
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,380

321
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,290
