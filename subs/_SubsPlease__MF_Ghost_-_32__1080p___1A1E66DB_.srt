<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're sure it doesn't look odd?</font>

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all, Kana-chan.</font>

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say you look better than most.</font>

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me what you think
of my yukata.</font>

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, of course, I think 
you look cute, too, Ren-chan.</font>

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not even looking!</font>

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm looking forward to 
my first Japanese fireworks display.</font>

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,220

fireworks in England.</font>

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,530

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In particular, I remember my mum taking
me out in London on Guy Fawkes Night.</font>

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,680

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Why are you being so formal?</font>

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to take a picture of you.</font>

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A picture? Of me in my yukata?</font>

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a no, then?</font>

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I didn't say that.</font>

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Ren.</font>

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's what you really want, 
take as many as you like.</font>

23

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait, I know I looked ugly 
in that one. Take another!</font>

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,950

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I ask someone to take it for us?</font>

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good idea.</font>

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,570

fireworks festival today.</font>

34

looked thrilled to be going out in yukata.</font>

35
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were like two peas in a pod.</font>

39
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it reminds me summer's ending,
 and that makes me a little sad.</font>

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I read somewhere that getting 
sentimental over the end of summer</font>

41
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is unique to Japan.</font>

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Why would that be?</font>

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Japan apparently has the richest
four seasons in the whole world.</font>

44

57

58
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, of course.</font></font>

62
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,140

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Hi, Nozomi.</font></font>

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me introduce you. 
This is my mechanic, Yamatani-kun.</font>

76
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello there.</font>

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pleasure.</font>

78
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my mechanic, Ogata-san.</font>

79
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's also the 86's owner.</font>

80
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey there.</font>

81
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The 86 is starting to look good out there.</font>

82
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The aero tweaks are paying dividends,
but just its whole aura is different now.</font>

83
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call it my mechanic instincts.</font>

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you see, we've got 
this really talented advisor.</font>

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's embarrassing to admit, 
but I've let him make most of the calls.</font>

86
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, by the way, we came for a test run
yesterday and saw the 4 car.</font>

87
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,040

92
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fiddled with the software. 
Gave it a power boost, too.</font>

97

a while to master tracks.</font>

98

no natural sense for it.</font>

99
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kind of talk is why 
you two are always fighting.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Who's this?</i></font>

104
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've never seen that car before.</i></font>

105
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since you're another English-made car,

106
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,400

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even if they get rejected or look lame,</i></font>

252
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I think when a person loves another,
 that's something to cherish.</i></font>

253
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And even after all that's happened, 
I'm still targeting the same thing.</i></font>

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>To reach the podium

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}And now, our feed switches

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking good, Nozomi.
Keep it up. Keep attacking!</font>

262
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it. After you screwed up
your qualifying run yesterday...</font>

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'll make sure to pick up the slack.</font>

266
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just put Yamatani-kun

267
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Listening to a worse driver is a drag!</i></font>

268
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you just say? I hope you

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I always believed Sawatari
 was a talented driver,</i></font>

274
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but he's even better than I thought.</i></font>

275
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's earned his spot

276
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and when he's on his A-game, 
he's as sharp as a razor.</i></font>

277
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But the thing with sharpness is 
it can also be brittle.</i></font>

278
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And that applies to Sawatari, too.</i></font>

280
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I can't help thinking about

281
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't wanna outdone by that guy.</i></font>

282
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought Double Lane was supposed
 to be a high-speed course.</i></font>

283

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How the hell did he post
a time like that in a wimpy Alpine?</i></font>

284
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, with this car's potential,

285
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If Sawatari can do it, so can I.</i></font>

287
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sawatari Koki's time is absurd.</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Beating the previous lap record
 by a full three seconds...</i></font>

289
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a thing to do 
on the first day of qualifying.</i></font>

290
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I feel like MFG is heading for
 a major period of change.</i></font>

294
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}but maybe it was a case of trying too hard,
 since none of them made many gains.</i></font>

295
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps Sawatari Koki's super record

296
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}But I think if there's gonna be a change,

302
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll definitely wanna tune in
 for all that, ladies and gents.</font>

303
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is MFG history in the making.</font>

304

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Let's meet up again tomorrow.</i></font>

 I'm hearing of it.</font>

308
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guy who did analysis for July's race
 knows Kanata-san's teacher, apparently.</font>

309
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He made it sound like Kanata-san would 
be going back to England after this year.</font>

310
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you know? Don't you guys
get to listen to the commentary feed?</font>

311
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, of course we do. 
We have huge speakers blaring it out.</font>

312
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess there must have been a bunch

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is bad. I've never

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kanata came to Japan to find his father.</i></font>

316
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,930
