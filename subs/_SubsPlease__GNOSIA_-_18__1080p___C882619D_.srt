00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll just have to use our own judgment.</font>

24
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,820

42
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I personally would like to get back

46
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there any point to that?</font>

47
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, why don't we all work 
this out over some food?</font>

48
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have time to relax now, don't we?</font>

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to calmly sort out what's going on.</i></font>

50
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,500

55
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But that means I have an extra day to 
work with compared to the previous loop.</i></font>

56
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait. The first thing I need to do 
is figure out why I'm here at all.</i></font>

57
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's still not full.</i></font>

58
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then the answer is simple.</i></font>

59
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There must be some information

61
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you bring me that wrench?</font>

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sure...</font>

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

64
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

65
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Yuri... right?</font>

66
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh, yeah.</font>

67
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but I can't see what I'm doing

68
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you move?</font>

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Sorry...</font>

70
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This ship is so old</font>

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that there are a lot of things 
that bother me as a soldier.</font>

73
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, sorry. I've actually only 
looped a few times so far.</font>

74
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right. There shouldn't be 
any Gnosia on this ship.</i></font>

75
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There'd be no reason 
to stay quiet about the loops.</i></font>

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I help you?</font>

77
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, no...</font>

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu.</font>

79
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

80
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be passing through 
a debris field soon.</font>

82
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a number of checks I want to do 
before that, so you'll have to excuse me.</font>

83
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's going on?</i></font>

84
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do we have here?</font>

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's practically bursting.</font>

86
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh... I never thought I'd get to 
study a living sample like this.</font>

87
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How does it feel to be entirely 
at the Silver Key's beck and call?</font>

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never change, Racio.</font>

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

90
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I know! Can I give you 
a problem to solve?</font>

91
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're challenging me?</font>

92
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, how you've underestimated me.</font>

93
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean you accept?</font>

94
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heh. It does sound entertaining.</font>

95
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After how smooth this leg of the journey 
has been, I've grown bored.</font>

96
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said...</font>

97
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If your problem isn't worth my time, 
you'll pay an appropriate price.</font>

98
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

99
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu is supposed to 
be looping, and yet...</font>

100
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Either they've lost 
their memories...</font>

101
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or they're acting like they have 
for some reason.</font>

102
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph. This isn't a problem to be solved 
at all. You're merely seeking advice.</font>

103
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured you wouldn't 
hear me out otherwise.</font>

104
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, whatever.</font>

105
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was bored, so I'll make an exception 
and give you your answer.</font>

106
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, the answer is quite simple.</font>

107
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surprisingly so.</font>

108
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it?</font>

109
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

110
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's say that Setsu genuinely 
doesn't remember anything.</font>

111
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

112
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps Setsu was never 
looping in the first place?</font>

113
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

114
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu was actually lying 
about looping all this time</font>

115
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in order to deceive you.</font>

116
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To win you over to their side.</font>

117
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu... was lying this whole time?</font>

118
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you actually take that seriously?</font>

119
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Consider it payback for 
what you pulled earlier.</font>

120
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite obviously impossible.</font>

121
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The truth is actually even simpler.</font>

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just think about it.</font>

123
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're currently in the period of time 
before the start point of your loop.</font>

124
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before...</font>

125
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. Setsu doesn't 
have the Silver Key yet.</font>

126
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Setsu in this world line is the Setsu 
from before they started looping.</font>

127
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ergo,</font>

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's highly likely that the information
you're supposed to obtain lies here.</font>

129
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's information that can't be gained 
on day one or later.</font>

130
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're amazing...</font>

131
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

132
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter the world line, 
you're always amazing, Racio!</font>

133
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never could've gotten this far

134
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

135
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph.</font>

136
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why you're a fool.</font>

137
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you've realized that much,</font>

138
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you should be able to figure out 
that something is still lacking.</font>

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Information that I can only get before 
Setsu obtains the Silver Key, huh...</i></font>

140
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

141
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

142
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Warning. There is an

144
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow...</font>

145
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

146
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu!</font>

147
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,880

148
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu!</font>

149
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up... and run...</font>

150
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it!</font>

151
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too late for me... So please...</font>

152
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu... No!</font>

153
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

154
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry...</font>

155
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what you told me long ago.</font>

156
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio!</font>

157
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio!</font>

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio...</font>

161
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri?</font>

162
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need you to repeat the following words.</font>

163
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Words...?</font>

164
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just do it!</font>

165
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doubt not.</font>

166
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doubt not...</font>

167
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fear not.</font>

168
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fear not...</font>

169
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And know.</font>

170
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And know...</font>

171
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowledge...</font>

172
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowledge...</font>

173
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will save all.</font>

174
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will save all...</font>

175
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri...</font>

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>With this,
Setsu will be pulled into this mess.</i></font>

177
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But... I want them to survive.</i></font>

178
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like we ended up here again.</font>

179
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

180
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the fact that we're here means...</font>

181
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri, take out your Silver Key.</font>

182
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

183
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done. The Silver Key is finally 
filled with all the information it needs.</font>

184
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, the loop can come to an end.</font>

185
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can finally... pay you back.</font>

186
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pay me back?</font>

187
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For letting me survive...</font>

188
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For saving me even though 
I was fated to die...</font>

189
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I owe you a debt that I want to repay.</font>

190
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I've been
looping all this time.</font>

191
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let's end this.</font>

192
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Open the door.</font>

193
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ladies and gentlemen!</font>

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now... it's party time!</font>

195
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Party...?</font>

196
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And to get things properly started...</font>

197
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">let's hear from Captain Jonas!</font>

198
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Shut yer mouths, shut yer mouths, yeah!</font>

199
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! You're louder than 
everyone here, bud.</font>

200
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Shut yer mouths!</font>

201
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is everyone here? 
Then without further ado...</font>

202
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe all of you know who I am, 
but allow me to introduce myself anyway.</font>

203
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Jonas. Yes, Jonas, 
the captain of this very ship.</font>

204
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}To all of you who have taken refuge from 
the turmoil in the Liu-An star system...</font>

205
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There were no Gnosia infectees 
when we left Liu-An...</i></font>

206
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That means I must have 
returned to day one again.</i></font>

207
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We gather here today to celebrate 
your safe arrival aboard this ship.</font>

208
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay. You don't need to worry.</font>

209
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}But as I humbly stand before you,</font>

210
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I cannot help but think that for all 
of us to come together like this</font>

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

212
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}can be nothing short of a miracle.</font>

213
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

214
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}However, there is one other way 
to think about it: this was fate.</font>

215
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your speech is too damn long!</font>

216
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yes, our encounter here 
was simply meant to be.</font>

217
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay! Let's skip straight to the toast!</font>

218
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

219
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph... A celebration, eh?</font>

220
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's probably too early for us 
to let our guards down.</font>

221
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no guarantee that the other 
star systems are safe, is there?</font>

222
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can worry about that when we get there.</font>

223
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just have some fun for now.</font>

224
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! You should eat, too, Racio! Here!</font>

225
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You as well, Yuri.</font>

226
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're pretty thoughtful, Jina. 
You like devoting yourself to others?</font>

227
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just like fattening people up.</font>

228
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, like, as a fetish thing?</font>

229
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I just like fattening people up.</font>

230
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Oh, I see...</font>

231
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But let's be for real for a minute.</font>

232
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only reason we're able to relax 
like this is because of Setsu.</font>

233
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I also... look up to Setsu.</font>

234
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were just amazing 
when they saved us in Liu-An.</font>

235
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you. Though I was only 
doing my duty as a soldier.</font>

236
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention, someone also helped me 
when we were running away.</font>

237
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And who was that?</font>

238
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure...</font>

239
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, you're a lifesaver, Setsu!</font>

240
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to repay you someday.</font>

241
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can just forget about it.</font>

242
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually... I'm pretty sure you will.</font>

243
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, excuse me, Yuri...</font>

244
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Me?</font>

245
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's hard for me to ask this 
with everyone around, but...</font>

246
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me...</font>

247
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Why are there two of you?" 
That's what you want to ask, right?</font>

248
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu... Y-Yes, that's exactly right.</font>

249
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two? What's that supposed to mean?</font>

250
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. That problem's 
about to be solved right now.</font>

251
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure how it even <i>can</i> be solved...</font>

252
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry, Stella. Just trust me.</font>

253
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

254
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, bud! What's going on here?</font>

255
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, just stay here and continue 
enjoying the food. I'll be right back.</font>

256
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri.</font>

257
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with me.</font>

258
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

259
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

260
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Save some for us...</font>

261
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, for Yuri.</font>

262
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you remember</font>

263
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what is said to happen 
when the Silver Key is filled</font>

264
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with knowledge and information?</font>

265
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It leaves its host and goes to another 
dimension in search of a new one.</font>

266
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. And I'm sure that I told you that</font>

267
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's also the key to solving 
the problem you're facing.</font>

268
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, I need your Key. Make it appear.</font>

270
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just as I thought.</font>

271
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a door that allows passage 
into a different universe.</font>

272
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A different universe?</font>

273
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world is the result of 
countless branching choices.</font>

274
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those choices are what shape the future of
the world and the individuals within it—</font>

275
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even fate itself.</font>

276
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The different universe on 
the other side of this door</font>

277
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is an entirely separate world 
that doesn't affect this universe.</font>

278
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regardless of the choices made, their 
causality will never influence the other.</font>

279
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think of the save data 
files in a video game.</font>

280
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's basically like that.</font>

281
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Each has the same characters 
and the same story,</font>

282
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they can never 
interact with each other.</font>

283
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand what this means?</font>

284
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If one of me is taken 
to the other side of the door,</font>

285
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we won't be able to interact anymore,</font>

286
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the issue with the dual 
existence won't happen.</font>

287
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is where we say goodbye.</font>

288
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait!</font>

289
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know what you were probably thinking.</font>

290
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That both you and I would be 
able to escape our loops here.</font>

291
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I wrong?</font>

292
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought that at first, too.</font>

293
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we can't.</font>

294
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because my Silver Key...</font>

295
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">isn't full yet.</font>

296
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You understand now, don't you?</font>

297
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's obvious. Because I—this me—</font>

298
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hasn't given you the Key yet.</font>

299
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once I take this through to the other 
dimension and shut the door behind me...</font>

300
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">your loop will end for good.</font>

301
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't they always say 
to close a door after you open it?</font>

302
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

303
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,050

once you go through there?</font>

305
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know... But it has to be me.</font>

306

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to keep looping on the other side 
of this door until I'm done—</font>

307
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">until I give you the Silver Key 
in that other universe.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

309

310
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,030
