00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello. Who is this?</font>

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hi!</font>

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Kayama. Haven't heard 
from you in a while.</font>

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, how's life as a teacher treating you?</font>

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really fulfilling!</font>

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My students are all so 
adorable and motivated.</font>

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The material has been 
incredible to teach, too.</font>

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You learn so much yourself 
when you're teaching.</font>

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's just something about a school.</font>

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels like a place where you belong.</font>

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you say so. Can't say I was ever a fan.</font>

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't remember school being a lot of fun.</font>

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No sense in being picky, though.
It's a job.</font>

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not my job, though.</i></font>

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's going to be.</font>

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be teaching in the hero course, 
here at our alma mater, U.A. High School.</font>

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a really strange 
thing to suddenly assume.</font>

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamada's going to be working 
here next semester.</font>

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that, it's just a matter 
of you answering the call.</font>

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't appreciate the idea of 
being tied at the hip to him.</font>

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I don't think I've ever said 
anything about wanting to be a teacher.</font>

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yamada mentioned something—</i></font>

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>that you need someone pushing you, 
or you never make up your mind.</i></font>

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then pass a message to him from me: "You
need to learn to keep your mouth shut."</font>

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I personally get the feeling that you're 
trying to ignore something important, too.</font>

26
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me rephrase: You both need to 
learn to keep your mouths shut.</font>

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Come on, I'm trying to have a serious—</i></font>

28
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm on patrol right now and need to go.</font>

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unbelievable. And completely irrational.</font>

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, time to get to work.</font>

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,350
<font face="Times New Roman" size="20"><b>{\an1}<font size="40"><font color="#c5000e">flashback</font></font></b></font>

32
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,350

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love bullying the weak!</font>

35
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like little kids! And kittens!</font>

36
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Little Red Riding Hood over

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll lead him away! Grab the cat and run!</font>

38
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, there! Get a load of me!</font>

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look like prey, too!</font>

40
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm right over here!</font>

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Eraser! That was a nice save.</font>

42
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing, man?</font>

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I was sliding along when...</font>

44
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up? Is something wrong over there?</font>

45
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when we were trying to decide what 
to do, he showed up out of nowhere.</font>

46
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! A cat?! Let me at it!</font>

47
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then he attacked us.</font>

48
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's simple enough.</font>

49
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for saving me!</font>

50
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take good care of the kitty!</font>

51
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You be careful on your way home!</font>

52
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, hello? This is Eraser 
Head, the pro hero.</font>

53
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've caught a thug,
and he needs to be taken in.</font>

54
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. I sent to the location over GPS,
so if you could confirm...</font>

55
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like it's about to start pouring.</font>

56
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what's the plan for the cat?</font>

57
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I guess I'll take it 
back to my place for now.</font>

58
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You gonna keep it?</font>

59
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, I hadn't really decided.</font>

60
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll need to feed it and 
clean up after it daily.</font>

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you handle training?</font>

62
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention vaccinations 
and getting it fixed.</font>

63
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if it gets sick, a vet 
can cost more than a doctor.</font>

64
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a student, right?</font>

65
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be able to look after it
even after you've graduated?</font>

66
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On the longer end, cats can 
live up to twenty years.</font>

67
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you prepared for
that kind of responsibility?</font>

68
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I honestly can't imagine that far ahead...</font>

69
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't look after it, 
then don't drag it around.</font>

70
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go put it back where you found it.</font>

71
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you... not like cats?</font>

72
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not why I'm telling you all this.</font>

73
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just, you haven't looked 
at it for a while now.</font>

74
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No sense in getting attached.</font>

75
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't take responsibility for it,
then you shouldn't get involved.</font>

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're pretty level-headed, Eraser.</font>

77
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like that.</font>

78
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just know my limitations.</font>

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not All Might.</font>

80
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a limit to the amount of 
power that a single person has.</font>

81
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in my case, I still 
don't amount to that much.</font>

82
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've felt that way ever since I was a kid.</font>

83
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whether I wanted to or not.</font>

84
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened to you?
Forget your umbrella?</font>

85
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's time for morning assembly, 
so hurry and get changed.</font>

86
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's fine.
It matches my state of mind.</font>

87
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever that's supposed to mean.</font>

88
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what happens if you get sick 
because of your state of mind?</font>

89
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Staying healthy is part of your job as a
student, and the path to becoming a hero.</font>

90
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

91
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This "path to becoming a hero" stuff. 
Can't even picture it.</font>

92
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm powerless.</font>

93
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there it is!
Shota Aizawa's pity party!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's girls in here too, y'know!</font>

132
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You suck, Shirakumo!</font>

133
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go to hell!</font>

134
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da!</font>

135
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cute!</font>

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, Oboro, I can't believe 
you picked up another one!</font>

137
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, attendance! Starting at 
the top of the roll with the boys!</font>

138
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aizawa!</font>

139
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

140
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rain stopped.</font>

141
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ooizu.</font>

142
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still don't amount to much.</font>

143
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yo.</font>

144
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Katasugi.</font>

145
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir!</font>

146
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kuga.</font>

147
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that I ever really expect to.</font>

148
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep.</font>

149
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sarudo.</font>

150
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here!</font>

151
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shirakumo.</font>

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here!</font>

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't even save a single cat.</font>

154
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tendo.</font>

155
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

156
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Niragi.</font>

157
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here...</font>

158
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fujimi.</font>

159
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mushimori.</font>

160
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

161
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamada.</font>

162
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

163
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pipe down, Yamada.</font>

164
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sense of resignation I felt...</font>

165
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It started to gradually change</font>

166
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in the summer of my second 
year in high school.</font>

167
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then, as with every year,</font>

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the majority of students in their second year</font>

169
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will undertake a work study 
over summer vacation.</font>

170
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means, even if it's 
in a learning capacity,</font>

171
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you're going to be working 
alongside pro heroes.</font>

172
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So be on your best behavior!</font>

173
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For those of you who haven't secured
a spot yet, start thinking about it.</font>

174
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aizawa. Shirakumo. Yamada.</font>

175
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm talking about you three,
do you get that?</font>

176
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

177
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

178
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

179
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pipe down, Yamada.</font>

180
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, I want all of you in your
costumes and over at the training grounds.</font>

181
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to be working with 
Class B on practical exercises.</font>

182
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This'll be a chance for you all to 
verify your strengths and weaknesses.</font>

183
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For those of you further along,</font>

184
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you to shore up your weaknesses 
before the work studies begin.</font>

185
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For those lagging, try and get a feel for
what you want to do with yourselves.</font>

186
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll start with 1-on-1 combat practice.</font>

187
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Begin!</font>

188
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your opponents will be randomized!</font>

189
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make use of what makes you special!</font>

190
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, there!</font>

191
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

192
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time for rescue training!</font>

193
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teamwork is crucial in
a crisis environment!</font>

194
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure to execute on 
your individual roles!</font>

195
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's still folks over there!</font>

196
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dance lessons!</font>

197
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heroes are representatives for 
multiple aspects of society!</font>

198
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Without popularity, you can't expect
commissions, which means nothing to do!</font>

199
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to express yourselves,
and in a way that will win their hearts!</font>

200
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,180
<font face="Verdana" size="20"><b>{\an1}<i><font color="#172922"><font size="35">Days later</font></font></i></b></font>

<font size="20"><b><font color="#a06e73">Faculty Room</font></b></font>

202
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did things go with the three of them?</font>

203
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ones who don't have work studies?</font>

204
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think Yamada will be fine.</font>

205
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

206
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Voice Quirk has plenty
of applications, whether in combat,</font>

207
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">rescue, or entertainment.</font>

208
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kind of versatility might make it
hard for him to settle on a specialty.</font>

209
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But in the future, that could just mean 
that he'll end up wearing many hats.</font>

210
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for Shirakumo,
his grades aren't remarkable,</font>

211
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he's got a bright, positive attitude.</font>

212
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

213
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll probably march to his own drum, 
no matter what he ends up doing.</font>

214
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That just leaves Aizawa...</font>

215
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I think he's trying very hard.</font>

216
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He gets above-average grades in both 
practical training and his studies.</font>

217
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I will say that
for as hard as he tries,</font>

218
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he doesn't have an image 
of what he wants to accomplish.</font>

219
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And until he figures that out,</font>

220
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's going to work against him 
in terms of finding employment.</font>

221
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With a Quirk like his... makes 
me wonder if that's part of it.</font>

222
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That reminds me, in combat 
practice the other day...</font>

223
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are such a pain, Aizawa!</font>

224
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care what that Erasure 
of yours is supposed to do,</font>

225
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I hate the way you wipe out a Quirk</font>

226
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then you start whipping
that nasty rag of yours around!</font>

227
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you're involved,
the battles get lamer.</font>

228
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which makes me look bad!</font>

229
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention, there's no 
point in any of that crap</font>

230
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if you can't actually stand 
your ground in a fist fight!</font>

231
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So knock it off with the 
stupid gimmicks already!</font>

232
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough, Sensoji!</font>

233
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all right, Aizawa?</font>

234
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yessir.</font>

235
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does he want from me?</font>

236
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just how my Quirk works.</font>

237
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the end of the day, my Erasure just 
makes things harder for other people.</font>

238
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like I'm producing 
anything positive.</font>

239
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Much less making anyone else happy.</font>

240
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, all this stuff about making 
the most of your Quirk,</font>

241
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what its applications are, and 
what I want to do with it...</font>

242
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really don't have a clue.</font>

243
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not just make life 
harder for villains, then?</font>

244
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Focusing on combat?</font>

245
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure doesn't fit his image.</font>

246
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, with superhuman combat, it often 
boils down to how Quirks interact.</font>

247
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But with your Erasure, it doesn't matter!</font>

248
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll always boil down 
to regular melee combat.</font>

249
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a talent!</font>

250
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not exactly good at 
melee combat, though.</font>

251
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially when going against big guys.</font>

252
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, hold on.</font>

253
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't give people food 
to cats. It's bad for them.</font>

254
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, okay.</font>

255
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad I had some spare cat formula.</font>

256
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really approve of you bringing 
him to school like this, but...</font>

257
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's better than leaving him 
alone at home all day, right?</font>

258
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're here at school 
to look out for him.</font>

259
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's he been doing his business? 
Everything alright there?</font>

260
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most of the time, he just 
goes on my gym clothes!</font>

261
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got me again!</font>

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's so nasty!</font>

263
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really need to take 
care of housetraining.</font>

264
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, hello there, boys.</font>

265
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enjoying your lunch up here?</font>

266
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's that third-year!</font>

267
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kayama!</font>

268
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's so cool!</font>

269
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know the roof's 
supposed to be off-limits.</font>

270
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you come here without permission?</font>

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kind of rule-breaking...</font>

272
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is awesome! It just screams "youthful!"</font>

273
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what brings you up here?</font>

274
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was on my way back from my work study,</font>

275
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and had some paperwork at 
the school to take care of.</font>

276
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for why I'm on the roof specifically...</font>

277
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love it up here!</font>

278
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a real rule-breaker yourself!</font>

279
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've gotta ask...</font>

280
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you not gonna wear 
anything under that coat?</font>

281
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my costume!</font>

282
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it some kind of material 
that's invisible to idiots?</font>

283
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like the empress's new clothes,
or something?</font>

284
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice snark!</font>

285
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love being an idiot!
Because she looks naked to me!</font>

286
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hooray! Hooray!</font>

287
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just don't get it...</font>

288
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's as bold as it is practical!</font>

289
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And provides the perfect kind of 
support for my Quirk and how I move!</font>

290
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This design that I came up with 
by focusing on all those elements</font>

291
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the very model of functional beauty!</font>

292
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have absolutely nothing
to be ashamed of!</font>

293
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you should take another look at it.</font>

294
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shota!</font>

295
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit trying to ruin the awesomeness!</font>

296
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you see something this beautiful, 
and find it to be shameful?</font>

297
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It just reflects the 
shame in your own heart!</font>

298
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I can't blame him for 
thinking that way at the moment.</font>

299
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the fate of people who are 
always on the cutting edge.</font>

300
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you wait and see!</font>

301
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In one year, I'll have redefined 
what's acceptable to wear in Japan!</font>

302
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fun fact: in one year,
there will be a legal debate</font>

303
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">about the acceptable level of 
exposure in hero costumes.</font>

304
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The law changed before what 
people considered acceptable!</font>

305
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I was too much of a pioneer!</font>

306
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never mind me, though,
What's up with the kitten?</font>

307
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's...</font>

308
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shota and I found him!</font>

309
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't mean you can 
bring him to school.</font>

310
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me see!</font>

311
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd you come from, little kitty?</font>

312
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will rubbing your belly-welly 
make you all sleepy-weepy?</font>

313
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is kinda embarrassing.</font>

314
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does he have a name?</font>

315
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, well...</font>

316
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not yet.</font>

317
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, what are your favorite foods?</font>

318
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sushi!</font>

319
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fried chicken!</font>

320
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm, uh, not particular.</font>

321
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Out of those, I think I'd go with sushi.</font>

322
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're a fancy piece 
of sushi, aren't you?!</font>

323
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna eat you up!</font>

324
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're looking for a permanent 
home for him, too!</font>

325
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, unfortunately, I'm going 
to move out once I graduate,</font>

326
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I won't have the time 
to take care of him.</font>

327
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say that single women with cats 
have a harder time getting married.</font>

328
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what you're worried about...?</font>

329
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, I won't be able to foster him for long!</font>

330
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure to find a real 
owner for him soon, okay?!</font>

331
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is one of those situations where 
she ends up keeping him, isn't it?</font>

332
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yea.</font>

333
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,010
<font face="Verdana" size="20"><b>{\an1}<i><font color="#172922"><font size="23">The next day</font></font></i></b></font>

334
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:09,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still think it was irresponsible to 
hand over a living being so casually.</font>

335
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Kayama. It'll be fine.</font>

336
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, we're not really in a 
position to be looking after a cat.</font>

337
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean the work studies?</font>

338
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard Yamada just got his sorted out.</font>

339
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some kind of combat-oriented agency...</font>

340
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's getting the details in
the faculty room right now.</font>

341
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't have pegged him
for a combat-type.</font>

342
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When it comes to public speaking, 
he even has his own podcast.</font>

343
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say the work studies are about 
getting the kind of experience</font>

344
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you wouldn't be able to
have on your own.</font>

345
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess if you go around fighting on 
your own, you're basically just a thug.</font>

346
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, there you are! It's the roof gang!</font>

347
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey there, Kayama.</font>

348
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for looking after the cat!</font>

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's what Sushi was up to today.</font>

350
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that was a big poopie!
What a good boy!</font>

351
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can see that we're eating, right?</font>

352
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were worried about toilet 
training though, right?</font>

353
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, that's why you came
to show us the video?</font>

354
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not exactly.</font>

355
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I needed to tell you
that I've got a home</font>

356
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for anyone who doesn't
have a place to belong.</font>

357
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like we're picking 
up stray cats every day.</font>

358
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I meant!</font>

359
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My boss says that anyone who doesn't have 
a work study can come work with us.</font>

360
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when you say your boss...</font>

361
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the boss of the agency 
that I'm doing my work study at!</font>

362
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The head of the Purple 
Revolution Agency!</font>

363
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The noble hero, His Purple Highness!</font>

364
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

365
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think... about what?</font>

366
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He seems like quite a character, actually.</font>

367
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's the best part!</font>

368
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You... think so?</font>

369
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember what he said to me.</font>

370
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"What we can't do alone, 
we can manage, together."</font>

371
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next time: Glass Sky.</font>

372
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The clouds that were blocking the sky 
from view... are starting to clear up.</font>
