00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Sentaro late again?</font>

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like.</font>

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Window shopping?</font>

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Might as well.</font>

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh yeah, the summer festival is tomorrow.</font>

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What time you goin'?</font>

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys meeting up somewhere?</font>

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beats me.</font>

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno.</font>

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't get in touch with her.</font>

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? What do you mean?</font>

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen?</font>

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really...</font>

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just that I kinda have this feeling 
that we're not gonna be dating.</font>

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Seriously?</font>

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My bad, my bad. Did I keep ya waiting?</font>

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And... Huh? What's wrong?</font>

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing really. I was just telling Kuwa 
I might not go to the festival tomorrow.</font>

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! But you said you were 
goin' with the Prince...</font>

24
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sentaro!</font>

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll treat ya to a caramel frap.</font>

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh, yeah. Thanks.</font>

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then let's all go together!</font>

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To the festival!
I'd be happy to have you, Ichi!</font>

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When we're with you, Ichi,
lots of girls come talk to us!</font>

31
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Forgot that's the 
type of guy you are, Sentaro.</font>

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Heh, gonna go buy that frap!</font>

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ichi, you sure you're okay with that?</font>

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't matter if I am.</font>

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing I can do about it, y'know.</font>

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's a no-go then I just go 
back to the way things were.</font>

37
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a frivolous guy, so I bounce back
 from things like that.</font>

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar.</font>

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was different with 
Takiguchi-san, wasn't it?</font>

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You looked like you really 
caught feelings there.</font>

41
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the hold up?!</font>

104
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,940

112
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,850

113
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,130

338
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

339
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to get heatstroke.</font>

343
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah... But...</font>

344
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's still not enough.</font>

345
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

346
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

347
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My... My heart isn't ready.</font>

348
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

349
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500

353
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,550
