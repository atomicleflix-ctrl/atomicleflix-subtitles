2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's that guy still alive?</font>

3
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like it. Let's have a toast.</font>

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't.</font>

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?</font>

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He even knows our technique!</font>

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know, but...</font>

8
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm collecting knives.</font>

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lots of them. Sharp, tough ones.</font>

10
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't!</font>

11
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, would you like to join
 my knife collection?</font>

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep playing your beautiful music.</font>

13
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perform gigs just for me.</font>

14
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've killed, and I've killed, 
and I've killed, and I've killed.</font>

15
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As his foot soldier, I kill anyone 
who stands in his way, just as ordered.</font>

16
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I loved sound ever since a very young age.</font>

17
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That used to be my thing.</font>

18
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to keep count, but I no longer
 know how many lives I've taken.</font>

19
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about you? Do you remember?</font>

20
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nonsense. I've never even 
attempted to keep track.</font>

21
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His orders are like sheet music 
with no "fine" directive.</font>

22
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An infinitely repeating da capo.</font>

23
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill. Kill. Repeat.</font>

24
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill. Kill. Repeat.</font>

25
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill. Kill. Repeat.</font>

26
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What'd you come out here for?</font>

27
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me it was to whine at me.</font>

28
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't know you were here. 
I only came to see Vash the Stampede.</font>

29
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See him? You're not here 
to kill that moron?</font>

30
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take him with me.</font>

31
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back to Knives?</font>

32
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to send him off 
with a thank-you note,</font>

33
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that sounds like a recipe 
for even more trouble.</font>

34
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I guess I can't let you have him.</font>

35
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get it, don't you?</font>

36
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do.</font>

37
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then if you'll simply turn around 
and walk away, I'll let you go.</font>

38
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me go?</font>

39
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just go ride off somewhere.</font>

40
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicholas the Punisher...</font>

41
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already gave that name back to <i>him</i>.</font>

42
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Nicholas D. Wolfwood now.</font>

43
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Now you're Vash the Stampede's
 sworn ally, are you?</font>

44
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kinda uncomfortable
 being labeled his friend.</font>

45
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess you've changed, 
and not just in name.</font>

46
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you even talking about?</font>

47
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, what's it gonna be?</font>

48
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This ship will be attacked soon.</font>

49
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And not just for Vash the Stampede.</font>

50
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The whole ark is coming 
to take all the plants here.</font>

51
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying Knives is on the way?</font>

52
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now would be the time to run.</font>

53
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where in this world would we even run?</font>

54
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. I don't want to spend 
even a second near that <i>thing</i>.</font>

55
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet there's no place to flee.</font>

56
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is how it goes down,
Midvalley the Hornfreak?</font>

57
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is what it is.</font>

58
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably best to beat you down right 
quick and prepare for the attack.</font>

59
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no plans to gig with you tonight, 
but it wouldn't be the worst thing.</font>

60
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given the current air temperature, 
the speed of sound is 340 meters per second.</font>

61
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this distance, my attack 
will reach you in 0.03 seconds.</font>

62
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will tbe bullets from your 
Punisher be faster than that?</font>

63
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno.</font>

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's find out!</font>

65
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. Then how about this?!</font>

66
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lens made out of air? Preposterous.</font>

67
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got offense and defense, huh? How handy!</font>

68
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A decoy?</font>

69
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice try.</font>

70
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know how good your hearing is.</font>

71
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess it wouldn't be that easy.</font>

72
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really have changed.</font>

73
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before, you wouldn't have 
tried to get me to leave.</font>

74
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You would've gunned me down, 
no questions asked.</font>

75
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even now, you're only aiming at my 
saxophone, trying to disarm me.</font>

76
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can change, too.</font>

77
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyone can change, whenever, wherever.</font>

78
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You...</font>

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can only say that because 
you were able to leave him.</font>

80
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I can do is follow
 the score I'm given—</font>

81
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really, though? Maybe you 
don't have to follow the score.</font>

82
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought improvisation 
was the heart of jazz.</font>

83
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just rip up that weirdo's score.</font>

84
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Play the sound and the music you want.</font>

85
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I could do that, I would!</font>

86
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can't, so...</font>

87
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've changed too, you know?</font>

88
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd used your 
omnidirectional sonic attack,</font>

89
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't have been able to dodge it.</font>

90
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're only using focused attacks.</font>

91
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I need to capture
 Vash the Stampede—</font>

92
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given your abilities, you could easily 
fire an attack that excludes him.</font>

93
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you won't... because you've changed.</font>

94
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can change.</font>

95
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perform gigs just for me.</font>

96
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't. I...</font>

97
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can. Nothing is impossible.</font>

98
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't!</font>

99
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weakling!</font>

100
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up, traitor!</font>

101
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was waiting for you to launch 
antiphase sound waves.</font>

102
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shoulda known it wouldn't be so simple.</font>

103
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still alive. You really are tough.</font>

104
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When did it get so dark? 
Did all the moons set?</font>

105
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I gave your brain quite a rattle.</font>

106
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't be able to see
 anything for a while.</font>

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impressive. I guess they don't call you 
the Ruler of the Sonic World for nothing.</font>

108
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it.</font>

109
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are you going?</font>

110
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to go pick up Vash the Stampede.</font>

111
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not on my watch.</font>

112
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impossible. You can't aim in that state.</font>

113
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know where you are. That said...</font>

114
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This time, I might end up killing you.</font>

115
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't take it personally.</font>

116
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right back at you.</font>

117
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tch!</font>

118
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn hunk of junk!</font>

119
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This next note is the last thing 
you'll ever hear.</font>

120
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feedback?!</font>

121
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you think that 
would interrupt my gig?!</font>

122
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This won't change your fate!</font>

123
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gig's over for the night.</font>

124
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hornfreak is here?</font>

125
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, Emilio. I was hoping 
you would know a weakness.</font>

126
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As things stand, 
I can't even get near him.</font>

127
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To defeat him, I'll need to get up close 
and destroy his instrument.</font>

128
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's your enemy, 
yet you have no desire to kill him?</font>

129
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are...</font>

130
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, never mind.</font>

131
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I tell you, will you 
take these off of me?</font>

132
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd take it under consideration.</font>

133
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, he has excellent hearing and 
plays the most beautiful notes.</font>

134
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you let him hear himself?</font>

135
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

136
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A feedback loop! Thanks, Emilio.</font>

137
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, about these handcuffs...</font>

138
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. But we can't let you 
out of this room for now.</font>

139
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have a deal.</font>

140
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That feedback was to mask 
the sound of your approach!</font>

141
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right, Wolfwood?</font>

142
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What took so damn long, dumbass?
Shoulda been here sooner!</font>

143
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sorry! I had trouble 
adjusting my new arm.</font>

144
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, he wasn't easy to reach, so...</font>

145
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He almost had me. Yikes.</font>

146
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emilio gave me the tip I needed.</font>

147
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The puppeteer did?</font>

148
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, you really do change everyone.</font>

149
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

150
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never you mind.</font>

151
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, a little to the right.</font>

152
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh, a little to the left! Or... down?</font>

153
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean "down"?!</font>

154
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mind the gap!</font>

155
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're too slow! 
Are you doing this on purpose?!</font>

156
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-N-No, I'm not!</font>

157
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill me.</font>

158
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need for that. It's over now.</font>

159
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing's over.</font>

160
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. Knives is on the way.</font>

161
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nai is?</font>

162
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

163
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be a massacre.</font>

164
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash!</font>

165
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you take care of Wolfwood?</font>

166
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Undertaker! Are you hurt?</font>

167
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you, Vash?</font>

168
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's not bad.</font>

169
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

170
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Where?</font>

171
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's fine.</font>

172
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}First aid first thing!</font>

173
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What? It's no big deal.</font>

174
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}That won't do! Prompt care is important.</font>

175
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody's going to kill anybody.</font>

176
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Enough already.</font>

177
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll protect everyone.</font>

178
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Including you, Midvalley the Hornfreak.</font>

179
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

180
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise.</font>

181
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Protecting your enemy? 
You really are soft.</font>

182
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's a good thing.</font>

183
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing good about it.</font>

184
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though it is kind of infectious.</font>

185
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

186
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never mind.</font>

187
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do we do?</font>

188
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't give up Vash.</font>

189
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:55,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nor the plants, nor our lives, of course.</font>

190
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to Hornfreak, Knives isn't 
able to do much of anything right now.</font>

191
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why they want Needle-noggin.</font>

192
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ones carrying out the attack
will be Knives's knife collection.</font>

193
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is no joke.</font>

194
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm...</font>

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are the ship's armaments?</font>

196
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sixty percent of our guns are operational.</font>

197
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have plenty of ammunition as well.</font>

198
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And our interceptors?</font>

199
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have ten ready to fly.</font>

200
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Then let's take them on.</font>

201
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luida...</font>

202
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might be able to take them out.</font>

203
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to try.</font>

204
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Initiate level 1 combat preparations.</font>

205
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noncombatants, retreat to the shelters.</font>

206
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood!</font>

207
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

208
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Initiating level 1 combat preparations.</i></font>

209
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Noncombatants, retreat to 
the shelters immediately. I repeat...</i></font>

210
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to stay aboard this ship.</font>

211
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now is your chance to—</font>

212
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No, please let us see this through.</font>

213
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, to the end!</font>

214
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How nosy.</font>

215
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not nosy. 
This is our duty as journalists.</font>

216
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also...</font>

217
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also?</font>

218
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I consider you people my friends.</font>

219
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When my friends are in trouble, 
I want to do my best to help them.</font>

220
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

221
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that going too far?</font>

222
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not at all.</font>

223
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree. Thank you.</font>

224
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was so cool of you, Meryl!</font>

225
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Oh, don't tease me.</font>

226
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, if you feel in danger, 
get to a shelter immediately.</font>

227
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

228
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep your eyes on the radar. 
Let me know the instant you see anything.</font>

229
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood!</font>

230
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash, are we going to die?</font>

231
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't let that happen. 
I'm going to protect you.</font>

232
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything's all right, Jessica.</font>

233
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

234
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right. I'm here to protect.</i></font>

235
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm going to protect everyone, Nai.</i></font>

236
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess Midvalley couldn't deliver 
Vash the Stampede to us.</font>

237
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. He wasn't capable 
of pulling it off anyway.</font>

238
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you sent him into Ship 3,</font>

239
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">just thinking maybe something 
funny might happen?</font>

240
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The star always arrives last.</font>

241
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The star? Are you talking about yourself?</font>

242
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who else could I mean?</font>

243
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll bring him here myself</font>

244
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to make him kneel before Lord Knives.</font>

245
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:54,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we'll take all the plants from Ship 3 
and bring Lord Knives back completely!</font>

246
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Exactly.</font>

247
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soon, Lord Knives.</font>

248
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The time to awaken draws near.</font>

249
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then, with your gaze,</font>

250
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you will...</font>

251
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we really doing this?</font>

252
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kind of late for that now, Doctor.</font>

253
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This vessel is now entering combat.</font>

254
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you're ready for me,
 Vash the Stampede.</font>

255
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Target in range.</font>

256
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire!</font>

257
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beginning assault.</font>

258
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our dawn is nigh.</font>
