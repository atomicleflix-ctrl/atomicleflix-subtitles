1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eek!</font>

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've done it now!</font>

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How dare you?!</font>

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't go easy on you this time!</font>

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma, get over here!</font>

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've come all this way, 
so it'd be a shame not to enjoy the water!</font>

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's fine.</font>

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm enjoying myself plenty.</font>

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, make sure you 
don't lose your rings.</font>

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here are four of the 
director's gemstone rings.</font>

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If any of our students leave the barrier,</font>

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'll revert to their non-human form, 
and be unable to re-enter the barrier.</font>

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if they wear these rings,</font>

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they can leave the barrier 
looking the way they do here at school.</font>

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you happen to lose your ring...</font>

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It carries a <i>very</i> heavy penalty.</font>

18
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How heavy are we talking here?</font>

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's for the director to decide, 
based on the circumstances.</font>

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So it depends on the director's mood?</i></font>

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you lose your ring, 
you won't be able to go back.</font>

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma, you're not going to swim?</font>

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come and play with us!</font>

25
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If an indoorsy type like me faced 
off against you feral brats,</font>

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd end up with every muscle 
aching in a few days—</font>

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not feral!</font>

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've spent my whole life with humans.</font>

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you were a pet for humans, 
not a wild rabbit?</font>

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of your business, Hitoma.</font>

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop prying.</font>

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, I'm mad!</font>

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll show you the aim of a true FPS gamer!</font>

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll beat you at your own game!</font>

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's all take Hitoma down!</font>

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this!</font>

39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Arial"><font size="14"><font color="#f5f5f5">Episode <font size="21">4</font></font></font></font></font>

43
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Miss Usami, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

44
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I have something important to tell you.</font>

45
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something important?</font>

46
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has to do with Seiko Kizaki.</font>

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen to Seiko?!</font>

48
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">During Mrs. Kizaki's checkup, 
they discovered a serious health problem.</font>

49
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've received news 
that she's in the hospital now.</font>

50
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's Seiko holding up?!</font>

51
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't look good.</font>

52
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me, Principal.</font>

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would Seiko Kizaki happen to be...</font>

54
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just as you've guessed.</font>

55
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's the reason that Miss Usami
wants to become human.</font>

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiko Kizaki, 76 years old.</font>

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Usami's owner.</font>

58
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After discussing it with the director,</font>

59
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we will allow a special 24-hour leave 
to the outside world for Miss Usami.</font>

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll let me see Seiko?!</font>

61
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, not in your current form.</font>

62
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the form you took 
before you entered this school.</font>

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you so wish, I'll be the one 
to take you to see Mrs. Kizaki.</font>

64
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma, I thought you should know 
about this as her homeroom teacher.</font>

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Usami, what is your decision?</font>

67
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me think about it.</font>

68
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami, you haven't left yet?</font>

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hitoma.</font>

70
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure what to say, 
since I don't know all the details.</font>

72
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just ask the principal, and you can 
take your special leave at any time.</font>

73
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no point.</font>

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no point in seeing 
Seiko in my old form.</font>

75
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She won't know how I feel.</font>

76
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think that's true.</font>

77
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you can't speak, 
you can still move.</font>

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's plenty to convey how you feel 
if you meet her in person.</font>

79
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't know anything, Hitoma.</font>

80
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do those things 
like a real rabbit!</font>

82
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

83
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My true form...</font>

84
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not a rabbit.</font>

85
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a stuffed rabbit doll!</font>

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen to this, Usami!</font>

87
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see, I've found someone I like!</font>

88
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ken, who sits right next to me!</font>

89
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We went to get some Calpis together today.</font>

90
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so nervous, I couldn't 
tell what it tasted like.</font>

91
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami, Kenichi proposed to me.</font>

92
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He asked me to marry him.</font>

93
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm still not sure about it...</font>

94
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I be a good enough wife 
to win his family's approval?</font>

95
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I really the right one?</font>

96
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I could hold a real 
conversation with you, Usami.</font>

97
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I'm just a plushie.</i></font>

98
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's no way for me to talk to you.</i></font>

99
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why, if my wish comes true one day,</i></font>

100
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I have so many things to tell you, Seiko.</i></font>

101
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hitoma.</font>

102
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to go see Seiko in this form.</font>

103
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the principal and 
director would never allow it.</font>

104
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I need your help, Hitoma.</font>

105
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help how?</font>

106
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need one of 
the director's gemstone rings!</font>

107
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do that.</font>

108
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those rings are locked away 
in a safe in the principal's office.</font>

109
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then let me borrow your ring!</font>

110
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No can do.</font>

111
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Breaking the rules will lead 
to docked points toward graduation.</font>

112
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll make it hard for you to graduate.</font>

113
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't come to this school to graduate.</font>

114
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I want is to become human 
and stay by Seiko's side.</font>

115
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the only one I can ask, Hitoma!</font>

116
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do anything if you do me this favor!</font>

117
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please, help me!</font>

118
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hitoma?</font>

119
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know!</font>

120
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you come with me, then?</font>

121
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

122
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll basically be my chaperone!</font>

123
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing to be scared 
of if we're together!</font>

124
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Scared?</i></font>

125
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah, I'm scared.</i></font>

126
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm scared of hurting 
one of my students again.</i></font>

127
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm scared of causing someone's misery.</i></font>

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm scared of being betrayed.</i></font>

129
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hitoma?</font>

130
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please...</font>

131
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need your help.</font>

132
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're prepared to face the consequences?</font>

133
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

134
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here!</font>

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No trouble slipping out of the dorms?</font>

136
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None at all.</font>

137
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't spotted by anyone.</font>

138
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The barrier extends to this cherry tree.</font>

139
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need this ring's power in order 
to go any further and remain human.</font>

140
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going off of prior experience,</font>

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I and anything I touch can pass through 
the barrier as long as I wear the ring.</font>

142
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That means as long as you're in contact, 
the ring's effect is passed onto you.</font>

143
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From here on, we'll have to 
keep holding hands...</font>

144
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

145
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't look so blatantly upset at the idea!</font>

146
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh...</font>

147
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't we shake hands 
back in the classroom?</font>

148
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's different from holding hands.</font>

149
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

150
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So be it.</font>

151
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get going.</font>

152
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hospital visiting hours end at seven.</i></font>

153
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Depending on when we arrive, 
Usami has an hour max with Mrs. Kizaki.</i></font>

154
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like this is it.</font>

155
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Usami?</font>

156
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

157
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<b><font size="26"><font color="#2b5cb2">Calpis</font></font></b></font>

158
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

159
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami.</font>

160
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

161
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be fine by yourself from here?</font>

162
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't it be easier to talk 
with Mrs. Kizaki if I'm not there?</font>

163
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

164
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the ring, then?</font>

165
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to turn back into 
a stuffed doll after coming all this way?</font>

166
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let you hold onto the ring.</font>

167
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I take the ring off, 
I'll lose my memories from school,</font>

168
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'll remember everything again 
when I touch the ring.</font>

169
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, that doesn't apply to you.</font>

170
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to go see her alone?</font>

171
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you see, I stayed up 
all night playing video games.</font>

172
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lack of sleep's 
finally caught up to me.</font>

173
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, you made me suddenly 
come all the way here.</font>

174
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like a little time to rest.</font>

175
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be napping, so pop in and 
say hi real quickly to your friend.</font>

176
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but I have trouble sleeping, 
so I took my usual sleeping pills.</font>

177
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so stupid.</font>

178
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

179
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you really <i>were</i> sleepy, 
you wouldn't have to take pills.</font>

180
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true.</font>

181
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I'm stupid.</font>

182
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stick out your pinky.</font>

183
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

184
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Good night, Usami.</i></font>

185
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I hope you can have a good talk with her.</i></font>

186
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is it?</font>

187
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have the wrong room?</font>

188
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I don't.</font>

189
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you friends with my granddaughter?</font>

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not it.</font>

191
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the only one in this room.</font>

192
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the right room.</font>

193
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came here to see you, Seiko.</font>

194
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Seiko"?</i></font>

195
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it's hard to 
believe, but I'm Usami.</font>

196
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:05,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami, the stuffed rabbit 
who was always by your side!</font>

197
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami?</font>

198
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, I know that came out of nowhere.</font>

199
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay if you don't believe
me since this is all so sudden.</font>

200
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For you.</font>

201
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Calpis, your favorite.</font>

202
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said you had some 
the first time you hung out with Ken.</font>

203
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you know that?</font>

204
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really my Usami?</font>

205
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

206
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been with you longer 
than anyone else has!</font>

207
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's me, Usami!</font>

208
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

209
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the hair clip I gave to Usami...</font>

210
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

211
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Four years ago, when you 
lost Ken, you felt so sad.</font>

212
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami...</font>

213
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami... It's really you.</font>

214
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiko.</font>

215
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to see you all this time!</font>

216
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiko, I have...</font>

217
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have so many things to tell you!</font>

218
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

219
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for leaving you so suddenly.</font>

220
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to become human 
so I could be with you!</font>

221
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After Ken passed away, 
you were always crying...</font>

222
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why all this time, 
I wanted to say I love you!</font>

223
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All this time, I wanted to say thank you!</font>

224
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel the same way.</font>

225
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

226
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami.</font>

227
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll always love you, too.</font>

228
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next year, I'll graduate and become human!</font>

229
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

230
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Best of luck. I'll be rooting for you.</font>

231
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

232
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make sure I become human!</font>

233
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then we can live together, Seiko.</font>

234
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never leave you alone again!</font>

235
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll always be together!</font>

236
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami.</font>

237
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

238
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see...</font>

239
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only have a month to live.</font>

240
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you see, I can't be there 
to live with you.</font>

241
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

242
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want that...</font>

243
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I wanted to live with you as well.</font>

244
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'll be gone, then all 
of my work is for nothing!</font>

245
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

246
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I don't think that your efforts 
were meaningless.</font>

247
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They are!</font>

248
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've worked so hard just for you, Seiko!</font>

249
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a mistake trying to become human!</font>

250
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should have just stayed 
as a stuffed animal with you!</font>

251
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say such sad things.</font>

252
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami, do you like humans?</font>

253
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like you, Seiko.</font>

254
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been through a lot, but when all's 
said and done, I still like humans.</font>

255
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lots of humans are nasty.</font>

256
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, but I still like them.</font>

257
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you don't like stuffed animals?</font>

258
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I like them, too.</font>

259
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say you like everything.</font>

260
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How easy to please.</font>

261
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami, what else do you like beside me?</font>

262
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">School's not so bad.</font>

263
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Studying, too.</font>

264
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fun learning about new things.</font>

265
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I don't hate humans, either.</font>

266
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

267
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any plans for the future?</font>

268
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm still not sure.</font>

269
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

270
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that reminds me.</font>

271
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you come here all alone?</font>

272
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hitoma... I mean, my teacher came with me.</font>

273
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was considerate enough 
to let us talk in private.</font>

274
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like a great teacher.</font>

275
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's not half bad.</font>

276
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although he's unreliable.</font>

277
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, could it be that 
you have a crush on him?</font>

278
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Where did <i>that</i> come from?!</font>

279
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I was a girl, all I ever did 
was talk to you about boys.</font>

280
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, am I right?</font>

281
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Not a chance!</font>

282
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the only one for me, Seiko!</font>

283
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

284
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he really has no chance?</font>

285
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a big meanie, Seiko!</font>

286
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mrs. Kizaki, I'm here 
to take your temperature.</font>

287
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, is this your granddaughter?</font>

288
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Yes.</font>

289
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid visiting hours ended at seven.</font>

290
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sorry.</font>

291
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiko.</font>

292
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for all the 
affection you showed me.</font>

293
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, too.</font>

294
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll always love you!</font>

295
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

296
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got to talk to Seiko.</font>

297
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma?</font>

298
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to become human.</font>

299
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made a promise to Seiko.</font>

300
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know what I want to do in the future.</font>

301
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to help humans.</font>

302
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By becoming a doctor.</font>

303
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to help people spend more time 
with their loved ones.</font>

304
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not easy becoming a doctor.</font>

305
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

306
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because of you 
that I've found a new goal.</font>

307
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So sleepy.</font>

308
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And wait, who are you?</font>

309
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wake up!</font>

310
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hitoma.</font>

311
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you forget that we need 
to keep holding hands?!</font>

312
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

313
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time for us to leave!</font>

314
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hospital's about to kick us out!</font>

315
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hospital?</font>

316
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I remember now!</font>

317
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you manage to talk to her?</font>

318
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

319
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's good.</font>

320
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You nincompoop!</font>

321
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite his appearance, the principal's 
super scary when he's angry.</font>

322
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hope you're hanging in there, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

323
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

324
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I brought it upon myself.</font>

325
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be easy taking a pay cut 
for three months.</font>

326
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I got off with just a pay cut.</font>

327
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That aside, Usami 
was suspended for a week.</font>

328
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's more, she lost 150 of her 
points needed to become human.</font>

329
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think she'll be 
graduating this year...</font>

330
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, Hitoma.</font>

331
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">G-Good morning.</font>

332
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the big deal?</font>

333
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That fishy look of yours creeps me out.</font>

334
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who scared me.</font>

335
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up?</font>

336
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need you.</font>

337
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If you don't need me, why'd you come here?</i></font>

338
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, Miss Usami.</font>

339
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Long time no see, Mr. Hoshino.</font>

340
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

341
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How come you never add the "Mr." for me?</font>

342
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't deserve it, Hitoma.</font>

343
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hoshino, please tell her off.</font>

344
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our school values 
the autonomy of its students.</font>

345
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, you need to work harder, Hitoma.</font>

346
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do a good job teaching me 
so I can become a doctor.</font>

347
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Work hard so I can earn my license.</font>

348
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do what I can.</font>
