00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you Flat Escardos?</font>

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with that face?</font>

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your mimetic muscles are moving in an
order that ignores its intended functions.</font>

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only caring about the ends
while neglecting the means...</font>

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}That is an immature thought process.</font>

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}If that's your way of
getting around in this world,</font>

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}you should alter your way of thinking.</font>

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you, children
should not be faking smiles.</font>

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These fashion choices
really feel like you.</font>

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't they?</font>

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's perfect for an
infiltration mission, right?</font>

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humph.</font>

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would have agreed...</font>

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if we were heading into
a disco full of cowboys.</font>

19
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This doesn't really feel like reality.</font>

20
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we really being
watched by Special Ops?</font>

21
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Moreover, the American government joining
forces with Mages in a conspiracy?</font>

22
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this, a fantasy movie?</font>

23
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I was surprised, as well.</font>

24
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it also makes sense.</font>

25

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You kinda look like you're having fun.</font>

26
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I... looked like I was having fun?</font>

27
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you not gonna tell them that
there is a vampire in the hospital?</font>

28
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to keep some cards up my
sleeve, just in case something happens.</font>

29
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

30
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe... they are good people.</font>

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this is how I have lived my life.</font>

32
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You...</font>

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}that assassin girl...</font>

34
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Quite the troublesome folks.</font>

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only you five showed up, huh?</font>

36
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So? How'd you feel fighting a real
monster and almost being killed?</font>

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's—</font>

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First of all, why do you
go so far to keep fighting?</font>

39
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is there to gain by standing
at the front line of this war...</font>

40
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where people can die at any moment?</font>

41
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

42
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are police officers!</font>

43
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's our job to save as
many people as possible</font>

44
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">under conditions where
we may die at any moment!</font>

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're glorifying things.
Does doing that put food on the table?</font>

46
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that you built a giant mansion.</font>

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hah, you sure have got some words!</font>

48
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Are you saying my works
are glorifications?</font>

49
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're exactly right.</font>

50
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An overglorified protagonist who sees
their will through to the end...</font>

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">sells really well, actually.</font>

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a special gimmick, so I'll
explain all sorts of stuff later.</font>

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, I—</font>

55
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">John Wingard, 28 years old.</font>

56
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second son in a family of Mages.</font>

57
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aspired to become a police officer</font>

58
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">after losing his mother in
a terrorist attack on an airplane.</font>

59
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you didn't want any person to end
up with the same sadness as yourself.</font>

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing like that.</font>

61
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I simply wanted revenge—</font>

62
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. I'm still going to glorify
it into something like that.</font>

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If revenge is what you actually
want, then revenge it is.</font>

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I originally had no interest
in plays or novels.</font>

65
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just tired of seeing
nothing but boring tragedies.</font>

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But one day... I saw a tragedy called
"Hamlet," and that was something else.</font>

67
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was overwhelmed.</font>

68
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It ended up being one of
my greatest inspirations.</font>

69
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

70
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Hamlet I saw was the
one where old man Ducis</font>

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">broke the original work into pieces...</font>

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and rewrote it with his
own interpretation.</font>

73
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}When I later read the real
thing written by Shakespeare,</font>

74
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I got all weak in the knees.</font>

75
00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:00,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Compared to the real thing, what I
saw was truly just a wannabe Hamlet.</font>

76
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what changed <i>my</i> life...</font>

77
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}was that wannabe.</font>

78
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is something I won't let anyone deny.</font>

79
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fake or whatever...</font>

80
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the passion packed in there
was real. That's all!</font>

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Noble Phantasms I create are fake...</font>

82
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the passion your boss
has is the real thing.</font>

83
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you believe him through to the end,</font>

84
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you should be able to overturn
as many of those real legends...</font>

85
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as you need to.</font>

86
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in.</font>

87
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chief, there's something
urgent I need to report.</font>

88
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Release me!</font>

89
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm innocent!</font>

90
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sit still!</font>

91
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in, Mr. Jack!</font>

92
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Infiltration...</font>

93
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is his intent, perhaps?</font>

94
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When we found him at the park...</font>

95
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the report said a cop and
a woman in a dress...</font>

96
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">suddenly appeared and disappeared, right?</font>

97
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

98
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is likely an ability of the Servant.</font>

99
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He should be off duty today.</font>

100
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will gather nearby Clan
Calatin members immediately.</font>

101
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

102
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also...</font>

103
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who the hell are you?</font>

104
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought we had a ceasefire.</font>

105
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't trust you.</font>

106
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where do your beliefs lie?</font>

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe in anything.</font>

108
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not in my client...</font>

109
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">not in Magecraft, not in myself.</font>

110
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have a god that
you send your prayers to?</font>

111
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

112
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">have yet to receive a god's favor.</font>

113
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The people who raised me</font>

114
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">dragged fetuses out of mothers'
wombs to experiment on them.</font>

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the sole purpose of creating
spellcasters that kill people.</font>

116
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said...</font>

117
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">those who commanded our country were gods.</font>

118
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they were annihilated. So...</font>

119
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have a grasp of
what this god thing is.</font>

120
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

121
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

122
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have made you confront
such harsh memories.</font>

123
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are different from the other Mages.</font>

124
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your eyes truly look like they
don't believe in anything.</font>

125
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is likely because you have yet to
discover what is worth believing in.</font>

126
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no right to speak
of faith at present.</font>

127
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

128
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope that someday...</font>

129
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when it is created within you,
your faith will be of good nature.</font>

130
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised, my boy!</font>

131
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like you're quite
the charming swindler.</font>

132
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

133
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be love at first sight, can it?</font>

134
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

135
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the first time someone has wanted</font>

136
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">something from me outside
of Francesca's begging.</font>

137
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is the meaning of this?</font>

138
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I take this as a form
of workplace harassment?</font>

139
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say things that the real
Vera might actually say.</font>

140
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still doubt me?</font>

141
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real Vera...</font>

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is currently headed to
the monitoring room.</font>

143
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was able to read it just now.</font>

144
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An IC chip in the neck.</font>

145
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something that complicated
cannot be copied instantly.</font>

146
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A machine, huh?</font>

147
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, something like that...</font>

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't be able to figure out.</font>

149
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Play Ball.</i></font>

150
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You tamed the Demonic Beasts?</font>

151
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Game Set.</i></font>

152
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You took over the police station's system?</font>

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stand down from
your attack posture...</font>

154
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Police Chief Orlando Reeve.</font>

155
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Roughly 40 percent of the personnel
within this police station...</font>

156
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}are all me at this point.</font>

157
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems you have gained
the upper hand here.</font>

158
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm glad you understand.</font>

159
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You show just a part of your powers...</font>

160
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to make the negotiations
advantageous to you.</font>

161
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just like what the mafia does.</font>

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no. All of the bounded fields
were connected to you, Mr. Chief...</font>

163
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I was trying to have
him check things out...</font>

164
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I didn't think we'd get caught.</font>

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry to have surprised you!</font>

166
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hah.</font>

167
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To think there'd be a Mage like you...</font>

168
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what do you want?</font>

169
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way you're here
to make an alliance, are you?</font>

170
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We came here...</font>

171
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to file a report!</font>

172
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you mean the fire in
the industrial district.</font>

173
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. There haven't been any
injured people brought over here.</font>

174
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Tsubaki?</font>

175
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On her right hand...</font>

176
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

177
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You take care of yourself,
too, Big Sister.</font>

178
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodbye, now.</font>

179
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I confirmed it.</font>

180
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Just like what Mr. Escardos claimed...</font>

181
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Tsubaki Kuruoka has
manifested Command Spells.</font>

182
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying that her Heroic Spirit</font>

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the source of the curse that is
falling upon Snowfield right now?</font>

184
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

185
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, as we don't know the
Heroic Spirit's identity,</font>

186
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we can't recklessly attack them.</font>

187
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On top of that, the location
is not suitable for that.</font>

188
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will use the pretext of an accident</font>

189
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and have the people inside
the hospital evacuate.</font>

190
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

191
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can also use large-scale Magecraft
to blow up the entire hospital.</font>

192
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those in the government wouldn't
hesitate to use that tactic.</font>

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I have shackled our position</font>

194
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as representatives of justice
with my subordinates...</font>

195
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">through a pact.</font>

196
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before I deem sacrificing this girl
to be the most justified move...</font>

197
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to check off
all possibilities and be</font>

198
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">absolutely positive it is our only option.</font>

199
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's good!</font>

200
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm very relieved!</font>

201
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of what?</font>

202
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you guys had agreed with
my suggestion from the get-go,</font>

203
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I wouldn't be able
to join forces with you!</font>

204
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You tested me?</font>

205
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry!</font>

206
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

207
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will say that if damage
spreads any further,</font>

208
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will point my gun at her.</font>

209
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! You've proven yourself
by telling me head-on,</font>

210
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I can feel assured in introducing you!</font>

211
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did a 27-step encryption on my end,</font>

212
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and they've placed measures
on their end, as well.</font>

213
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, I don't think anyone
will eavesdrop on us.</font>

214
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

215
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I am the instructor of Modern Magecraft
Theories at the Clock Tower.</font>

216
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I usually borrow the title
of "Lord El-Melloi II."</font>

217
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}However, for you lot, this other name
should be better at ringing a bell.</font>

218
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Waver Velvet."</font>

219
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just a third-rate Mage
who once participated</font>

220
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in the Holy Grail War of Fuyuki.</font>

221
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to confirm the combative
forces of each faction.</font>

222
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In terms of sheer magnitude,</font>

223
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Police Chief and Dumas duo
should be the greatest...</font>

224
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as they can move ordinary
police officers, as well.</font>

225
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the clan led by Tiné Chelc?</font>

226
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fifty-six foot soldiers are
active within the city.</font>

227
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}There should be more in
their base in the valley...</font>

228
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that's outside of
Watcher's observation range.</font>

229
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though, the number of actual
forces is probably 46.</font>

230
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The others are either spies
from other syndicates</font>

231
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or are being swayed by their propositions.</font>

232
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. It looks like they're
having a hard time.</font>

233
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on a second.</font>

234
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Flat Escardos and the police chief seem
to have formed an alliance just now.</font>

235
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're going to start a secret operation
at the Central Hospital tonight.</font>

236
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord El-Melloi II.</font>

237
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a greater armchair
detective than rumors say.</font>

238
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, right?</font>

239
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regardless...</font>

240
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm relieved both of you
are really good people!</font>

241
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We already had ascertained the
situation about Tsubaki Kuruoka.</font>

242
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her parents were natural born Mages,</font>

243
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and they used their daughter...</font>

244
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as a subject for Magecraft experiments.</font>

245
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems the objective
of their alliance...</font>

246
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is to rescue the Master in the
hospital from her Servant.</font>

247
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is she captive?</font>

248
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. That Master is a
comatose... a sleeping girl.</font>

249
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but...</font>

250
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That expression may perhaps
be a suitable phrase.</font>

251
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The parents raised their
daughter very, very preciously.</font>

252
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As if putting their favorite
bird inside a birdcage.</font>

253
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could say her current self...</font>

254
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has been set free.</font>

255
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the first time in her life...</font>

256
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she was able to go to the
outside world that she admired.</font>

257
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, the possibility of
the operation failing is high.</font>

258
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why's that?</font>

259
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you, there are moles everywhere.</font>

260
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you'd call "corrupted cops."</font>

261
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The police chief...</font>

262
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">surely doesn't think that
one of the Clan Calatin...</font>

263
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is a henchman for the Scladio Family...</font>

264
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">of all things.</font>

265
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that girl going to be murdered?</font>

266
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't like it?</font>

267
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps so.</font>

268
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My boy, can you actually be hesitating?</font>

269
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Francesca told me to do as I like. But...</font>

271
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand it too much.</font>

272
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll say this just in case...</font>

273
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if you value your life,
don't head over there.</font>

274
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured out where that vampire is.</font>

275
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to talk to you directly.
Is that all right...</font>

276
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assassin?</font>

277
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's one person...</font>

278
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like you to get rid of and stage
it like an accident or natural death.</font>

279
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If thou proceed, thou cannot turn back.</font>

280
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Know if thy conviction
degrades into a fake,</font>

281
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the curse in its entirety
will fall back upon thee...</font>

282
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}and consume thee whole.</font>

283
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would sacrifice all of Magecraft
for the United States.</font>

284
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it is for this nation...</font>

285
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't even hesitate to kill citizens.</font>

286
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

287
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Police Chief wants to use the
Holy Church to his advantage.</font>

288
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Depending on how the operation pans out,</font>

289
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we want you to take care
of one Master. That's all.</font>

290
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, you are?</font>

291
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't look like a police officer.</font>

292
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you!</font>

293
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Flat!</font>

294
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the Master for Berserker!</font>

295
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm counting on you as the
Overseer of the Holy Grail War!</font>

296
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

297
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finally have a Master who
acknowledges me as Overseer?</font>

298
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Hansa Cervantes.</font>

299
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'll apologize if this is rude...</font>

300
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but Mr. Hansa, is about 70 percent
of your body made of machines?</font>

301
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can tell?</font>

302
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. It was something I
couldn't understand at first.</font>

303
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's amazing! I've
never met a cyborg before!</font>

304
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you launch rocket punches and stuff?</font>

305
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe even a drill?</font>

306
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My fist doesn't detach, but
my arm extends three meters.</font>

307
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And a drill? That's a secret.</font>

308
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so touched!</font>

309
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't mind a Mage from the
Clock Tower, can I shake your hand?</font>

310
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got some good taste.</font>

311
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you get bored of Magecraft, you
should convert over to the Holy Church.</font>

312
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Father Hansa is revealing
his hand to a Mage.</font>

313
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that okay?</font>

314
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't do anything about it.
Hansa is like a kid inside.</font>

315
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>I have already gotten rid of
the people in the vicinity.</i></font>

316
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the time of the operation's start...</font>

317
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>we will use Magecraft to put the
people inside the hospital to sleep</i></font>

318
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so we may hurry inside.</i></font>

319
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>Our objective is securing
Tsubaki Kuruoka...</i></font>

320
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>a Master. Nothing else.</i></font>

321
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please make sure to not
cause injury to civilians.</i></font>

322
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing less from a survivor
of the Holy Grail War.</font>

323
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both Lord El-Melloi II...</font>

324
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and his student...</font>

325
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad we settled things well.</font>

326
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must be grateful to the police chief.</font>

327
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The theories of Tsubaki Kuruoka's
Heroic Spirit your mentor spoke of...</font>

328
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the plan he came up with
were both quite marvelous.</font>

329
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody in the Clock Tower</font>

330
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">can win against Professor in
negotiations without Magecraft!</font>

331
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you trying to save that child?</font>

332
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the obvious thing to do.</font>

333
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true.</font>

334
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, you have a looseness about
you that's unfitting for a Mage.</font>

335
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However,</font>

336
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's all too reckless to expose yourself
to someone who is normally your enemy...</font>

337
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for someone else's sake.</font>

338
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a simple story.</font>

339
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just thought if the Professor were
in my shoes, he would save her.</font>

340
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before I am a Mage of the Escardos Family,
I'm Flat of the El-Melloi Class.</font>

341
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To abandon that child here is betraying
Professor and all of my peers.</font>

342
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am scared of doing that just as
much as losing my purpose as a Mage.</font>

343
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

344
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you say you're scared,
I am forced to understand.</font>

345
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Mr. Jack, why don't you oppose?</font>

346
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

347
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to survive the Holy Grail War,</font>

348
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we don't have to reach out
and save a girl, right?</font>

349
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's simple.</font>

350
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was merely influenced by
you and your mentor, as well.</font>

351
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, that makes you a student
of the El-Melloi Class, too!</font>

352
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You harbor within you a great divergence</font>

353
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from the world that you
yourself aren't aware of.</font>

354
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was terrified of that, as well.</font>

355
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans all live with a sense of divergence</font>

356
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from this world somewhere
within themselves.</font>

357
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But upon speaking with your
mentor, I felt relief.</font>

358
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Professor is—</font>

359
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not for the fact that he is your mentor.</font>

360
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was because you felt
a sense of reverence</font>

361
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for how the said mentor lives his life.</font>

362
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as you have that spirit...</font>

363
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you will always...</font>

364
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">be able to overcome the
divergence within yourself.</font>

365
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something is coming!</font>

366
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that?</font>

367
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,970
