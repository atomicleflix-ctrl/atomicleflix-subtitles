"a flake whose only skill is peeping."</font>

184

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's run away.</font>

267
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">K-Kukuru?</font>

268
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard about Rota.</font>

269
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This world is a stinking bag of shit.</font>

270
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sick of it.</font>

271
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with me.</font>

272
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is where you wanted to go?</font>

273
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always wanted to try one of these!</font>

274
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so good!</font>

275
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kukuru, you try a bite, too!</font>

276
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They sell stuff this good 
this late at night?</font>

277
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We didn't know anything about anything.</font>

278
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

279
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do my big idea next.</font>

280
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Running away from home 
and bleaching your hair?</font>

281
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've always been extreme, Kukuru.</font>

282
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up.</font>

283
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that's what makes you so cute.</font>

284
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Don't call me cute!</font>

285
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cutie-pie!</font>

286
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's cold! Don't you know 
what month it is?</font>

287
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

288
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks good on you.</font>

289
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet I don't look like 
an exorcist at all like this.</font>

290
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After I jumped out of that window, 
I experienced so much for the first time.</i></font>

291
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I couldn't believe how light 
the popular sneakers were.</i></font>

292
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How soft girls were.</i></font>

293
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I made lots of friends and did lots of bad
stuff, like I was blotting out my past.</i></font>

294
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, ain't nothing 
Ku and Ren here can't handle.</font>

295
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, we rock!</font>

296
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we rule!</font>

297
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep your voice down.</font>

298
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, how'd you get so strong?</font>

299
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ku looks like the badass he is, 
but Ren's got that babyface...</font>

300
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good question.</font>

301
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But every now and then, 
I was hit with this feeling of emptiness.</i></font>

302
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ren. What's wrong?</font>

303
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">K-Kukuru... wh-what am I gonna do?</font>

304
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't remember Rota's face.</font>

305
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only been six months... 
but it's already so fuzzy.</font>

306
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promised I'd never forget him.</font>

307
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried every day to hold on
 to him in my memory.</font>

308
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Serina.</font>

309
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got two smartphones, right?</font>

310
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hand one over.</font>

311
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one's for work!</font>

312
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm meeting a client tomorrow—</font>

313
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Factory reset.</font>

314
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

315
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But why?</font>

316
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a picture.</font>

317
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of me.</font>

318
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A picture?</font>

319
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you were fighting hard 
not to forget Rota.</font>

320
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But human memory's never perfect.</font>

321
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good memories and shit ones 
all fade with time.</font>

322
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But take a picture and you'll 
never forget me, right?</font>

323
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So quit cryin' already, asshole.</font>

324
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I could feel something 
in my heart start to relax.</i></font>

325
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna take tons.</font>

326
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna take so many... from now on.</font>

327
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Take a bunch.</font>

328
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My first picture was lousy as hell.</i></font>

329
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, Ku!</font>

330
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't go making Ren-kun cry!</font>

331
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up, idiot! They're having a moment!</font>

332
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get it, 
but that's friendship for ya!</font>

333
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was out of focus, 
and I had a finger in the frame.</i></font>

334
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But it was an important picture.</i></font>

335
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're not friends.</i></font>

336
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're family.</i></font>

337
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When Kukuru decided to 
go back to the exorcist world,</i></font>

338
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>it wasn't even a question 
if I'd go with him.</i></font>

339
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I'm with my family, 
I don't care where I call home.</i></font>

340
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As long as it's a house 
without bars on the windows.</i></font>

341
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, hey, let's take one to remember this!</font>

342
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Remember what?</font>

343
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno. Anything.</font>

344
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, go on! Take it!</font>

345
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute! I didn't do my 
makeup right! Lemme fix it first!</font>

346
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks the same as ever!</font>

347
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, get in here.</font>

348
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gonna take it now! Smile, Kukuru, smile!</font>

349
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No fair! Let me in—</font>

350
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that I never forget 
what matters to me again.</i></font>

351
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You first, Hasumi!</font>

352
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the—</font>

353
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My family's in danger!</font>

354
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So get outta my way, dumbass!</font>

355
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kukuru...</font>

356
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, be safe!</font>
