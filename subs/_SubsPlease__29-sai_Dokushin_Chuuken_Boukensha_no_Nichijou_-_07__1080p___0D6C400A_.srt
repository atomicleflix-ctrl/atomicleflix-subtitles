00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heya.</font>

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're home!</font>

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back, Hajime, Rirui.</font>

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We brought you something!</font>

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, thank you! What is it?</font>

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder what this is.</i></font>

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A shachihoko walker!</font>

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From Yanago, I believe.</font>

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. You know your stuff.</font>

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm something of a scholar, you see.</font>

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui beat it up!</font>

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, that is most impressive!</font>

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two must be most 
competent adventurers.</font>

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, we are!</font>

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. In that case...</font>

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've actually been compiling 
data on monsters.</font>

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you be willing to accompany me 
into the dungeon, as my escort?</font>

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}AN ADVENTURER'S DAILY GRIND AT AGE 29</font>

19
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}EPISODE 7: RIRUI AND COCKO</font>

20
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for accompanying me today.</font>

21
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, our pleasure.</font>

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is the kid coming with?</font>

23
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid I asked her to stay 
behind and wait, but...</font>

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

25
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The dungeon is dangerous for kids.</font>

26
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a kid too!</font>

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never know if 
adventurers are any good!</font>

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I know Papa won't say a word
if you two don't do your job!</font>

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm going myself!</font>

30
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cocko! Don't be rude!</font>

31
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hajime works real hard!</font>

32
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph! We'll see about that.</font>

33
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hajime's awesome. What a nasty girl!</i></font>

34
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I hope she trips a trap 
and learns her lesson.</i></font>

35
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}TRAP</font>

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}TRAP</font>

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a trap ahead. Watch your step.</font>

38
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look. These are trap-detecting glasses.</font>

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll reveal anything here 
on the less-dangerous levels.</font>

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can save your concern for yourself.</font>

42
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although I guess I'll raise 
your trust level slightly.</font>

43
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No differences from my last 
observation, it seems.</font>

44
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's even taking notes 
on common monsters like this?</i></font>

45
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, couldn't you just ask the guild 
lady about monsters like this?</font>

46
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why go to all this trouble yourself?</font>

47
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aah, yes. A fine question!</font>

48
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's still so much that 
we don't know about dungeons.</font>

49
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are cases where the monsters 
that appear within suddenly change,</font>

50
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or the same monsters 
are suddenly a different size.</font>

51
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These changes can cause 
much trouble for adventurers.</font>

52
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, we can sometimes
anticipate these changes.</font>

53
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you ever seen a slime quivering
 in the corner of a room?</font>

54
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think so.</font>

55
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, if you do, instead of killing it, 
check back on it the following day.</font>

56
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should find that its eyes
 have turned into gems.</font>

57
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bwah?! A gem slime?!</font>

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that true?!</font>

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, it is.</font>

60
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And periodic observation is required 
to learn about such changes.</font>

61
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you mean to tell me 
you didn't even know that?</font>

62
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a famous example.</font>

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what makes 
you adventurers so stupid.</font>

64
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are plenty of other cases too.</font>

65
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it seems my tongue slipped!</font>

66
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Are you serious?! "My tongue slipped" 
doesn't mean you can spit like that!</font>

67
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now, do try to keep 
quiet in the dungeon.</font>

68
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No bickering in the the 
dungeon, you little goofs!</font>

69
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we take a break?</font>

70
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, yes.</font>

71
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is she drawing or something?</i></font>

72
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If she sucks, I'll make fun of her!</i></font>

73
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

74
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Not a thing!</font>

75
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you been in this line of work long?</font>

76
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no, normally I help with farming.</font>

77
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only pursue my scholarly interests 
when I've saved up enough...</font>

78
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this data proves valuable, I'll be 
able to make life easier for my family.</font>

79
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And hopefully make up for the trouble 
I put my wife and daughter through.</font>

80
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mind if I take a look?</font>

81
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, go right ahead!</font>

82
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's adventurers who I hope will gain 
the most from my work.</font>

83
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's certainly impressive.</font>

84
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The stuff in his notes really would 
come in handy to adventurers.</font>

85
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to see his data for myself.</font>

86
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah? I bed it'd prove 
useful for the guild too.</font>

87
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Mr. Shinonome...</font>

88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember when you were away in Yanago?</font>

89
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like I got quite a few requests.</font>

90
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I guess I <i>was</i> gone for five days.</font>

91
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate to dump that on you after 
the lovely souvenir, but...</font>

92
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear you.</font>

93
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welp, I'll tackle them as they come 
like I always do.</font>

94
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'll be counting on you.</font>

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it.</font>

96
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me. Pa— er, my father is working,</font>

97
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I'd like to take 
him something to eat.</font>

98
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a problem. Just give me a second.</font>

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But talk about impressive.</font>

100
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your father's a scholar, right?</font>

101
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's amazing!</font>

102
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no, it's...</font>

103
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? A scholar?</font>

104
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a chicken beaster, right?</font>

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your old man's probably 
dumb as a brick, then.</font>

106
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A literal birdbrain!</font>

107
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some dumbass calling himself a scholar?</font>

108
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kinda joke is that?</font>

109
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You told her!</font>

110
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What do they know?
Nothing about Papa, that's for sure!</i></font>

111
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My papa's not stupid!</i></font>

112
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You adventurers are the stupid ones.</i></font>

113
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What an annoying day!</font>

114
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That birdbrain can't even hit the dungeon
on her own, but she acts so snobby!</font>

115
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a pain in the butt that Cocko kid is!</font>

116
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just a kid too.</font>

117
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She kept making fun of Rirui!</font>

118
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really hate her!</font>

119
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her old man may be cool and smart, 
but she's no good at all!</font>

120
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's probably stuck up just 
'cause her dad's so smart and all!</font>

121
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, I'm hungry.</font>

122
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you even listening, Hajime?!</font>

123
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, yeah. Sure I am.</font>

124
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you're not! Even though I'm so mad!</font>

125
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Pay attention!</font>

126
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dummy...</font>

127
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui, for today...</font>

128
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Shinonome! I had the the guild 
clerk take a look at my data,</font>

129
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she purchased my research!</font>

130
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She even agreed to buy more 
of my notes going forward!</font>

131
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I am most grateful to you!</font>

132
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to hear it.</font>

133
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall be ever so busy from now on!</font>

134
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,160

136
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-So I wouldn't mind being 
friends with you.</font>

137
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that face supposed to mean?!</font>

138
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you have something 
to say, just say it!</font>

139
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you gone.</font>

140
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have to be so rude?!</font>

143
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why does Rirui have to stay behind?!</font>

144
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think it over, Hajime!</font>

145
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm busy today, okay?!</font>

146
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So what?!</font>

147
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Rirui, Pops is behind on 
his work in town, so...</font>

148
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He needs our help <i>because</i> he's so busy!</font>

149
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you really are something.</font>

150
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear I'll be of use! 
Take me with you, Hajime!</font>

151
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! Look, a flying slime!</font>

152
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Where does he get off doing that 
when Rirui doesn't get to fly?!</font>

153
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd it go, Hajime?!</font>

154
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-He actually left Rirui behind!</font>

155
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's how the cookie

156
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dang it! Get back here!</font>

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Settle down, Rirui!</font>

158
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Release me!</font>

159
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Come on! Easy there!</font>

160
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't try and stop me!</font>

161
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit struggling!</font>

162
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, if it isn't two 
bronze-rank adventurers.</font>

163
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you be available 
to help me out today?</font>

164
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have work? For us?</font>

165
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You came to the right adventurers!</font>

166
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Dragon slaying?</font>

167
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It says ore collection.</font>

168
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can read, Anyango?</font>

169
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I'd like you to handle
 posting the job listings.</font>

170
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about Rirui? What should Rirui do?</font>

171
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you please clean the floor?</font>

172
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Consider it done! It'll be spotless!</font>

173
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyango, could you hand me the 
listing for the mountain wolf hunt?</font>

174
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

175
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see...</font>

176
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, you move these two down 
and make a note of the number.</font>

177
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

178
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see... Were these supposed
 to go by the entrance?</font>

179
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui can manage!</font>

180
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui! You all right?!</font>

181
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui?</font>

182
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui...</font>

183
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui is useless.</font>

184
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you say that? 
You did a great job cleaning!</font>

185
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anybody can clean!</font>

186
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, come on...</font>

187
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't read... I'm weak...</font>

188
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm not cut out to be an adventurer.</font>

189
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry for being 
a useless party member.</font>

190
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say that!</font>

191
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're making me sad!</font>

192
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened here?!</font>

193
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. It's true you were only doing
chores that anyone could have today.</font>

194
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But seeing you tackle them impressed me.</font>

195
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I understand why 
you're Mr. Shinonome's partner.</font>

196
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Adventurers who stay local often 
end up taking care of jobs</font>

197
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that are effectively leftovers
on relatively short deadlines.</font>

198
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kind of work where the pay often 
doesn't match the effort required.</font>

199
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lot of it is tiresome, 
not to mention boring.</font>

200
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you don't take the work
 seriously just because it's dull,</font>

201
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it could put the village at risk.</font>

202
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The most important thing 
for a resident adventurer</font>

203
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is how earnestly they tackle their tasks.</font>

204
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's a major tool that 
both you and Mr. Shinonome share.</font>

205
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm finally done.</font>

206
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work.</font>

207
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They helped me out 
with some of my guild work.</font>

208
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui worked hard to tidy 
things up around here.</font>

209
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

210
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something I want 
to ask about, Mr. Shinonome.</font>

211
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Reading and writing, huh?</i></font>

212
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I don't have any jobs today. 
I guess the timing works out.</font>

213
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up!</font>

214
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's Rirui!</font>

215
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Anya!</font>

216
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're coming to school today?</font>

217
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">School?</font>

218
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanna study, right?</font>

219
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm stoked to have you in class!</font>

220
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just go and have a good time.</font>

221
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, let's go!</font>

222
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meet Rirui and Cocko. I hope you'll 
all give them a warm welcome!</font>

223
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

224
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What is </i>she<i> doing here?</i></font>

225
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, Rirui, what should we study today?</font>

226
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui is... bad with writing.</font>

227
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, okay then. We'll work on 
reading and writing today.</font>

228
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can read and write, can't you, Cocko?</font>

229
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you help Rirui with that?</font>

230
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

231
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind teaching you, 
but I expect gratitude.</font>

232
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make it simple enough that 
even an idiot like you can follow.</font>

233
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're actually taking this seriously.</font>

234
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're an adventurer.</font>

235
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why worry about anything 
other than killing monsters?</font>

236
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not good enough.</font>

237
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui wants to be able to read the job 
postings and look up monster data.</font>

238
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui wants to be like Hajime!</font>

239
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

240
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's fine.</font>

241
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My dream is also to be
 a scholar like my papa.</font>

242
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Stare...</i></font>

243
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? What's the problem?</font>

244
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dream... That's it!</font>

245
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui's dream is to become 
an amazing adventurer!</font>

246
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on. If you hold it like that, 
your handwriting is going to be a mess.</font>

247
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Put it between your fingers.</font>

248
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like so.</font>

249
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's it going, Rirui?</font>

250
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anya!</font>

251
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Rirui's new friend, right?</font>

252
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Anyango! Nice to meet you!</font>

253
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We're not exactly friends...</font>

254
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's play dodgeball, Rirui!</font>

255
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! Let's do it!</font>

256
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you coming?</font>

257
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll pass. I want to read a bit more.</font>

258
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you say so.</font>

259
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, Rirui!</font>

260
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, okay!</font>

261
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, sorry about the wait!</font>

262
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry it up!</font>

263
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're in for a whole new Rirui today!</font>

264
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh my! A giant armored dragonfly!</font>

265
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow! That's awesome!</font>

266
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have this variety in my village.</font>

267
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,780
