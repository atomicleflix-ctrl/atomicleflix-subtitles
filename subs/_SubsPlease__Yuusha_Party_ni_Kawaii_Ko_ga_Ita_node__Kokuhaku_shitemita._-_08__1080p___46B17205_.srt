1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A quest from the merchants' guild?</font>

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Cargo keeps getting stolen</font>

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from merchant ships over in 
the port town of Frimeille.</font>

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The quest is to investigate the thefts,</font>

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and if possible, to capture the 
thieves and find the stolen cargo.</font>

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm... A port town, huh?</font>

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ocean!</font>

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki!</font>

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That quest is mine!</font>

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here.</font>

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! You can't go?!</font>

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have important work to do.</font>

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really can't leave Minerva for 
several days straight right now.</font>

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stupid.</font>

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, okay?!</font>

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Failing to check Cecilia's schedule 
in advance was my mistake!</font>

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that at your waist?</font>

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weapon.</font>

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, are those your feathers?</font>

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My body.</font>

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cut it out! You'll give 
people the wrong idea!</font>

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger.</font>

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're unusually obedient today.</font>

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for keeping you.</font>

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happiness? Why are you here?</font>

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning.</font>

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That... hair accessory...</font>

30
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now departing for Frimeille.</font>

31
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger.</font>

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is Happiness here? This 
isn't a pleasure trip.</font>

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I asked her to come because she 
could be valuable in battle.</font>

34
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's pretty skilled with magic.</font>

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

36
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't even know that about her.</font>

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not. You pretty 
much just met her.</font>

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have plenty of time 
to get to know her.</font>

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, let's go.</font>

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dude, you should be sitting 
next to Happiness!</i></font>

41
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're finally here.</font>

42
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna go meet the client.</font>

43
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys start asking around.</font>

44
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

45
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I...</font>

46
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'm counting on you.</font>

47
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since they're both here, 
I'll give them time alone.</i></font>

48
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Information.</font>

49
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

50
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need something, miss?</font>

51
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quest.</font>

52
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quest? What does that mean?</font>

53
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"We're here to do a quest 
for the merchants' guild.</font>

54
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd like you to tell us what you 
know about the thefts on the ships.</font>

55
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any idea who 
might have done it?"</font>

56
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I knew that, I wouldn't be 
having such a hard time here.</font>

57
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even when I post guards, 
stuff still gets stolen.</font>

58
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mysterious.</font>

59
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess so.</font>

60
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the guys upstairs treat us 
sailors like we're the thieves.</font>

61
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Innocent?</font>

62
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course! Men of the sea never steal!</font>

63
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll investigate.</font>

64
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You believe me?</font>

65
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

66
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Men of the sea don't keep secrets.</font>

67
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can ask me anything.</font>

68
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, boys! Gather up!</font>

69
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanna know about the thefts?</font>

70
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're innocent, ya know!</font>

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want some candy, miss?</font>

72
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a sausage fest.</font>

73
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, hard at work, huh? How's it going?</font>

74
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one has any information 
about the thief at all.</font>

75
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the ships have had 
guards posted at all times,</font>

76
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but no one remembers the 
moment the thefts happen.</font>

77
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds weird.</font>

78
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, it's weird.</font>

79
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the sailors were behind it, I'd 
think they'd come up with a better lie.</font>

80
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you think it was someone else?</font>

81
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some said that right before 
their memories cut off,</font>

82
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they could hear a beautiful singing voice.</font>

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Singing?</font>

84
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suspect demons are involved.</font>

85
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably mermaids.</font>

86
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mermaids...</font>

87
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to meet one.</font>

88
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Happiness! I hear there's 
a mermaid around here?</font>

89
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't!</font>

90
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it really was a mermaid?</font>

91
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Masa, this is real bad!</font>

92
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're all gonna get eaten!</font>

93
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you guys are adventurers, aren't you?</font>

94
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So get rid of that mermaid!</font>

95
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's right!</font>

96
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Please!</font>

97
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Are mermaids that scary?</font>

98
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really don't know?</font>

99
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tons of sailors 
have ended up shipwrecked</font>

100
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or even killed by mermaids.</font>

101
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the sea around here was so safe...</font>

102
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we're too scared to get on our boats!</font>

103
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I am Raven, captain of 
the knights of Clariness.</font>

104
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is a knight's duty 
to protect the people.</font>

105
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will defeat the mermaid without fail."</font>

106
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the knight captain 
from the hero's party?!</font>

107
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad you're here!</font>

108
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You gotta take out those demons for us!</font>

109
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess, from the humans' perspective,</font>

110
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">demons and monsters are 
things to be feared, huh?</font>

111
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Recluse.</font>

112
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd that come from?!</font>

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Truth. Demon King's army. Conquer humans.</font>

114
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know. I just forgot for a second.</font>

115
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to keep you.</font>

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Done with what you needed to do?</font>

117
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

118
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got more paper and pens.</font>

119
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work.</font>

120
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you.</font>

121
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat.</font>

122
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right...</font>

123
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's sweet.</font>

124
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's sweet here is the 
mood you guys are setting.</i></font>

125
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki, I found someone who 
claims he saw a mermaid.</font>

126
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

127
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was shopping, a man 
came up and talked to me.</font>

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... Captain?</font>

129
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}WHAT?</font>

130
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes, sir! The thing is...</font>

131
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw those sailors hiding the 
cargo in a cove just outside town.</font>

132
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there was...</font>

133
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a mermaid in there!</font>

134
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds kinda shady.</font>

135
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I think we need to make sure.</font>

136
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happiness, you can wait here.</font>

137
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

138
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fighting demons is dangerous.</font>

139
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was once a village 
where demons ran rampant.</font>

141
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the time...</font>

142
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there were so many lives 
I failed to protect.</font>

143
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a knight. It's my job 
to protect the people.</font>

144
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be sure to defeat the mermaid.</font>

145
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So don't worry. I'll be back.</font>

146
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Absolutely not.</font>

147
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on.</font>

149
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Happiness?!</font>

150
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, she'll be fine.</font>

151
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a hundred times 
stronger than she looks.</font>

152
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er... but...</font>

153
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be it.</font>

154
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wooden box.</font>

155
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep, no doubt about it.</font>

156
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It all matches the descriptions 
of the stolen cargo.</font>

157
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ocean.</font>

158
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This cove's too small to dock a boat in.</font>

159
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Raven?</font>

160
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something's there.</font>

161
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no!</font>

162
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cover your ears!</font>

163
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I let my guard down, I'll 
be asleep in a heartbeat.</i></font>

164
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happiness!</font>

165
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?!</font>

166
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happiness is using her own song 
to cancel out the mermaid's?</font>

167
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki!</font>

168
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

169
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not getting away!</font>

170
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care if I die.</font>

171
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, please, I need your help.</font>

172
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My friend has been captured by the humans.</font>

173
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She hasn't done anything.</font>

174
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, just make sure she survives!</font>

175
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quiet.</font>

176
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be deceived by 
the words of a demon.</font>

177
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dislike.</font>

178
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happiness?</font>

179
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move, Happiness.</font>

180
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

181
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you protecting a demon?</font>

182
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't.</font>

183
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Raven, just put the 
sword down for now. Okay?</font>

184
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're siding with the demon, too?</font>

185
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. If she attacked humans, 
she ought to be taken out.</font>

186
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't show mercy to anyone 
who hurt me or my friends, either.</font>

187
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why?</font>

188
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because it sounds like she has a reason.</font>

189
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't hurt to hear her out first.</font>

190
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

191
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

192
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You okay?</font>

193
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

194
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah? You've gotten stronger.</font>

195
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um...</font>

196
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sorry. Forgot about you.</font>

197
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, if something's going 
on, tell us about it.</font>

198
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all believe me?</font>

199
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do.</font>

200
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

201
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really.</font>

202
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is so awkward!</i></font>

203
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, then! Time for introductions!</font>

204
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Yoki the adventurer. Nice to meet ya!</font>

205
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hit your head?</font>

206
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm perfectly sane, you dolt!</font>

207
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm trying to lighten up the mood here!</font>

208
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This rude one here is Happiness,</font>

209
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the sulking guy who refuses 
to look at you is Raven.</font>

210
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... my name is Shike.</font>

211
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, Shike, why did you 
try to put us to sleep?</font>

212
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A human ordered me to.</font>

213
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We normally try to avoid 
getting close to humans,</font>

214
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but one day...</font>

215
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was playing with my friend, Misaki,</font>

216
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when we were caught up in a sudden storm.</font>

217
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next thing I knew, we'd 
been captured by humans.</font>

218
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want your friend to 
live, you'll do as I say!</font>

219
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then I just followed that 
human's orders and sang</font>

220
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to put the people on the boats to sleep.</font>

221
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it doesn't seem like she's lying.</font>

222
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki, don't be fooled by appearances.</font>

223
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't trust her?</font>

224
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I could never trust a demon.</font>

225
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then... trust me as I trust her.</font>

226
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

227
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

228
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll start a new investigation 
based on what the mermaid said.</font>

229
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Empty.</font>

230
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, these are just 
fakes left here for show.</font>

231
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the thief leaked information 
to lure his pursuers here,</font>

232
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where he'd have the mermaid put 
them to sleep to silence them.</font>

233
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! We were about to be killed?!</font>

234
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pretty roundabout 
method for a demon.</font>

235
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Shike, do you know where 
the thief's hideout is?</font>

236
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. He blindfolded me 
during transit, so I don't know.</font>

237
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What to do?</font>

238
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If my hunch is correct,</font>

239
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the thieves should show up here soon.</font>

240
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can make them tell us.</font>

241
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me be the one to make sure.</font>

242
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never thought we'd catch the 
eye of the knight captain!</font>

243
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's about time we 
moved to another island.</font>

244
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, Captain! I'm glad to see you're safe.</font>

245
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were worried, so we 
wanted to check on you...</font>

246
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you the thieves?</font>

247
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What?</font>

248
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dude, what's with your voice?</font>

249
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds so weird!</font>

250
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fools.</font>

251
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both you and I are beneath that mermaid. 
At least she cares for her friend.</font>

252
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't kill you, but I will 
have you judged under the law.</font>

253
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsk. Damn that mermaid.</font>

254
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll have to punish her good later.</font>

255
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get him, boys!</font>

256
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it!</font>

257
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ruffians had the nerve 
to use an innocent mermaid.</font>

258
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will put an end to your story—</font>

259
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move.</font>

260
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can fight with you.</font>

261
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hang on! You've got it all wrong!</font>

262
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That mermaid had us under her control!</font>

263
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is the mermaid's friend?</font>

264
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's... probably Shike's friend, right?</font>

265
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They packed her up like cargo.</font>

266
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emergency.</font>

267
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the mermaid called Misaki, right?</font>

268
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

269
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, we can change our fins into feet.</font>

270
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't use our powers 
when we do, though.</font>

271
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perv.</font>

272
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't looking, okay?!</font>

273
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Report.</font>

274
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! What are you gonna 
report, and to who?!</font>

275
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Misaki! I was so worried!</font>

276
