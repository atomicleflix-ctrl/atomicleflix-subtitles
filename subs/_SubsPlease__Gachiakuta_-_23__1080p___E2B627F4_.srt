00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish we'd gotten here a little earlier.</font>

7
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe the Raiders were 
trying to build a giant trash beast</font>

8
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and ride it up to the Sphere.</font>

9
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those filthy Raiders!</font>

10
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard they were up to no good,</font>

11
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but now they're creating trash beasts?!</font>

12
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a declaration of war 
against the Cleaners!</font>

13
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The question is, how could one 
be artificially created?</font>

14
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how many do they have?</font>

15
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard it all.</font>

16
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was trying to make an entry 
in the... Watchman Series?</font>

17
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he failed.</font>

18
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then the failure became 
the imitation trash beast.</font>

19
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guita... you're showing skin.</font>

20
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get it, though.</font>

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does getting the whole Watchman Series 
together grant you a wish or something?</font>

22
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd wish to turn back time so I could 
really fight that imitation trash beast!</font>

23
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make an entry... in the Watchman Series?</font>

24
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, there's a lot we don't know.</font>

25
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll just have to keep 
an eye on Raider activities.</font>

26
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a feeling we'll be helping out 
with more of their "failures" in the future.</font>

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,940

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,540

46
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, after the Raider incident two days ago,</font>

47
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it put everyone to sleep except Rudo.</font>

48
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rudo. It's impressive that you can 
stay awake with driving like that!</font>

49
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously, what's with the sunglasses?</font>

50
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're also always blaring that music! 
It's way too loud!</font>

51
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, it's loud! 
Just like someone else I know!</font>

52
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously, keep it down already!</font>

53
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, yeah.</font>

54
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess we just don't answer that question.</font>

55
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those clothes look great on you, Rudo!</font>

56
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really love your silhouettes, huh?</font>

57
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The brand name's Colosso, right? Yeah!</font>

58
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To know what it means, you'll have 
to ask the person who made it!</font>

59
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, that'd be me!</font>

60
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you guys've got some pretty 
heavy fabric up in the Sphere, huh?</font>

61
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it that cold in the Sphere?</font>

62
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or maybe the Ground's just really hot?!</font>

63
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, hey! Are you ignoring me 'cause 
you're a real Cleaner now, is that it?!</font>

64
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sad?</font>

65
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So happy!</font>

66
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

67
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's just too nervous 
to make small talk right now.</font>

68
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He says he's not used to visiting 
people who are recuperating.</font>

69
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flowers?</font>

70
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you supposed to bring flowers 
for a get-well-soon visit?</font>

71
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was curious, since we didn't do it for Gris.</font>

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you bring flowers 
to hurt people in the Sphere?</font>

73
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pretty awesome.</font>

74
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On the Ground, flowers are a precious resource.</font>

75
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're difficult to grow 
and difficult to buy.</font>

76
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

77
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Delmon worked really hard 
for the flowers he has.</font>

78
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For his wife who's gone now...</font>

79
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

80
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't give you my flowers.</font>

81
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I mean...</font>

82
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. Forget it.</font>

83
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But bringing flowers for the wounded
 is an excellent custom!</font>

84
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's something we should do!</font>

85
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they don't need to be real, I know a shop 
that sells excellent artificial flowers!</font>

86
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go buy some, Rudo!</font>

87
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll tag along.</font>

88
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were about to hit up Alice for medicine</font>

89
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and buy some other things 
we need for the visit.</font>

90
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Crap.</i></font>

91
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It kinda feels like...</i></font>

92
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm pushing Sphere culture on them.</i></font>

93
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zanka... Is he really that bad off?</font>

94
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said he was out 
with Jabber's poison all this time?</font>

95
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, kinda.</font>

96
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like not even Eishia's power 
could completely excise the poison.</font>

97
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know what kind of poison Jabber used,</font>

98
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if it was some kind of personal recipe,</font>

99
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or if he even knew what kind of poison 
he was using, for that matter.</font>

100
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At any rate, she had a hard time 
pinpointing exactly what it was.</font>

101
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just glad it seems like it wasn't fatal.</font>

102
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though someone who intentionally uses non-fatal 
poisons is kind of freakier in its own way.</font>

103
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, he was the only one 
that got beat up that badly.</font>

104
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's probably a blow to his self-esteem.</font>

105
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe I should plan this out better.</i></font>

106
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?</font>

107
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait—</font>

108
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zanka didn't grow up in the slums, 
and he wasn't subject to oppression.</font>

109
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he has experienced lows
 in the environment he grew up in.</font>

110
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rock bottom.</font>

111
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

112
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He fought against his weakness 
and crawled his way up.</font>

113
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kind of person who's 
always fighting with himself</font>

114
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">won't be broken by something like this.</font>

115
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he'll be something even better 
than a genius some day.</font>

116
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll become strong.</font>

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Enjin?</i></font>

118
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up, Semiu?</font>

119
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Where are you right now?</i></font>

120
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Infirmary. Zanka's room.</font>

121
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, perfect timing.</i></font>

122
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've got someone here who wants 
to apologize to him about Canvas Town.</font>

123
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, it's about his spell.</font>

124
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... y'see...</font>

125
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The thing is...</font>

126
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The wrong spell got drawn on Zanka!</font>

127
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're sorry!</font>

128
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why just Zanka?</font>

129
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remlin! Explain now!</font>

130
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Remember how, 
just before you went to Penta,</font>

131
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I drew the "reduce major damage 
just one time" spell on you all?</font>

132
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I drew it to have the same 
effect on all of you, right?</font>

133
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For those of us who took damage, 
it seemed to work. Right?</font>

134
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I bet! Thank goodness!</font>

135
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... so, the point is... see...</font>

136
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the process of drawing... I started 
thinking it'd be funny to draw one weird spell</font>

137
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">on just Zanka, the most serious guy there...</font>

138
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I might've ended up doing 
that on accident.</font>

139
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Zanka's spell didn't have 
the damage reduction effect?</font>

140
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What "weird spell" did you draw on him, then?</font>

141
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zanka...</font>

142
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">do this.</font>

143
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

144
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, that's pretty bad.</i></font>

145
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zanka. Listen—</font>

146
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

147
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one's ever done 
that kinda thing to me before...</font>

148
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you laughing about?</font>

149
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my fault you got hurt so bad...</font>

150
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, stop that. This ain't your fault.</font>

151
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spells are just s'posed to be insurance.</font>

152
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't count on it when 
I'm fighting, so don't worry.</font>

153
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should've done better. That's all.</font>

154
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was still too weak.</font>

155
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It ain't anyone's fault.</font>

156
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you can apologize all you want, 
but I won't hold it against ya.</font>

157
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But at least let us pay for your hospital—</font>

158
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, don't bother.</font>

159
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need all that to get stronger.</font>

160
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't take me lightly.</font>

161
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's evolving.</font>

162
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got somethin' you need, Rudo?</font>

163
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or is this a pity thing?</font>

164
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that's it, I'll toss you on your ass,
even if it tears my wounds back open to do it.</font>

165
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like you got the wrong idea, 
so I'll say this again.</font>

166
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I ain't so far gone that I'll blame 
my own weakness on Remlin.</font>

167
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if I went all-out back there 
and still ended up the most beat-up...</font>

168
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if I'm the only one 
who got knocked outta the fight...</font>

169
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if I wasn't any help to anyone...</font>

170
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So long as I get stronger, 
it ain't no problem!</font>

171
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So watch me do it, okay?!</font>

172
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Strangely, I found that all the pity 
I'd felt for him had vanished.</i></font>

173
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even though I, as a Sphereite, 
was the main reason it had all happened,</i></font>

174
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>he's not blaming anyone for it.</i></font>

175
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I think I can learn more from this guy.</i></font>

176
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What...</font>

177
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with the face?!</font>

178
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're lookin' down on me, you scuzzball!</font>

179
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you assume that?!</font>

180
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just seeing you in a new light!</font>

181
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A new light, huh?!
 You think you can judge me, is that it?!</font>

182
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like your head's still up in the Sphere!</font>

183
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You freaky-eyebrowed bastard!</font>

184
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give back those flowers I bought for you!</font>

185
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flowers?! You brought me flowers 
while I was convalescin'?!</font>

186
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Good buddies.</font>

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. To speed up your recovery.</font>

188
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Follo and Delmon picked out some of them.</font>

189
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything else was contributed 
by the others as a whole.</font>

190
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Preciate it. Thanks.</font>

191
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Enjin gave it to me personally! 
What a great day!</i></font>

192
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, trainer man.</font>

193
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I wanna have fun with them
and <i>happily</i> get my revenge!"</font>

194
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, that's Rudo's new goal.</font>

195
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, he's lookin' down on us.</font>

196
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've told him how we're fightin' for our lives,</font>

197
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and here he's puttin' fun and revenge 
on the same pedestal.</font>

198
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kid's become insatiable.</font>

199
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we didn't make it across the border. 
Who knows if that was good or bad for Rudo?</font>

200
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're here right now.</font>

201
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was a lot of screaming on the way,</font>

202
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the Raiders didn't succeed 
in getting us out of the picture.</font>

203
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though I don't think taking us out 
was their main goal either.</font>

204
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if their real goal is to take down 
the Sphere rather than antagonize us,</font>

205
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if they're going to be making trash beasts, 
that's something we need to deal with.</font>

206
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd have to face the Raiders again,
 whether Rudo was with us or not.</font>

207
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, I'm gonna focus on the same thing.</font>

208
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I gotta get stronger.</font>

209
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if Rudo wants to try a buncha stuff out 
before he gets his revenge,</font>

210
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he should be allowed.</font>

211
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It don't matter to me how many 
new friends he makes here on the Ground.</font>

212
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Rudo's gotta realize 
what it is he's forgettin'.</font>

213
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As his trainer, do I gotta 
teach him that crap too?</font>

214
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now he's sleepin'?</font>

215
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you saying?</font>

216
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The experiment was a success.</font>

217
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

218
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though we lost the imitation trash beast,
some newbies, and the Watchman Series entries?</font>

219
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The main thrust of the experiment was to see 
if it was possible to cross the border alive.</font>

220
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They made it back alive.</font>

221
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was no problem at all.</font>

222
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a surprise.</font>

223
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you were the kind of man</font>

224
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who wanted things to go more according to plan,</font>

225
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and to destroy all potential obstacles.</font>

226
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are things you can learn 
from impurities in the experiment as well.</font>

227
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In other words, he only sees them 
as parts of the experiment.</i></font>

228
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Cleaners got their work cut out for them.</i></font>

229
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A proper trash beast for crossing the border 
has already been prepared.</font>

230
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just need to work on enhancing it now.</font>

231
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fu wasn't much, but Noerde 
was a strong-willed person.</font>

232
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

233
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A seed I planted in the past 
blossomed beautifully.</font>

234
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was a good warrior.</font>

235
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bundus.</font>

236
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations.</font>

237
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The reward you requested for your promotion.</font>

239
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been looking for this forever!</font>

240
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Some kind of curio?</i></font>

241
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I look forward to you continuing 
to be an asset to the Raiders.</font>

242
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm truly honored.</font>

243
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel so unworthy</font>

244
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to join the stars of the Raiders 
on the front lines.</font>

245
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So... What's my first order as a first-stringer?</font>

246
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font size="40">Choker</font></b></font>

247
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The chokers.</font>

248
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This incident has confirmed 
that the chokers are made by a Giver—</font>

249
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">one with enough power to relay messages 
through most of the Ground.</font>

250
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a good chance they have a piece 
of the Watchman Series in their possession.</font>

251
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see, I see...</font>

252
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Find the maker of the chokers...</font>

253
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A truly engaging order.</font>

254
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you're going to collect 
the Watchman Series,</font>

255
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">should you have let those boots get away?</font>

256
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feels like a waste.</font>

257
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the Cleaners have them, 
that's all that matters.</font>

258
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as we know where they are, 
we can always go and get them.</font>

259
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are Raiders.</font>

260
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll search the far corners of the Ground,</font>

261
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">gather up the Watchman Series 
with the incredible energy it provides...</font>

262
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,390
