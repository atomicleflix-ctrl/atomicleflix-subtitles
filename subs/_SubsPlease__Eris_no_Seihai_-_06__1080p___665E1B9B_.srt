00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I imagining things, or have you 
been neglecting my revenge lately?!</font>

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well...</font>

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's been a month since the kidnapping.</i></font>

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kate's testimony revealed several facts 
about the mysterious Daeg Gallus.</i></font>

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kiriki kirikuku.</font>

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The "spell" Lady Lily left behind was 
one of the organization's passwords.</i></font>

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Their goal is to steal her key.</i></font>

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I decided to give it to His Lordship 
and ask him to investigate it himself.</i></font>

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The kidnapper had a sun tattoo,</i></font>

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so we think he was
 a member of Daeg Gallus,</i></font>

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but someone assassinated him in jail 
before he could be questioned.</i></font>

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Witnesses placed 
Crown Princess Cecilia in the vicinity.</i></font>

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now tell me, 
why are we calling on Abigail?</font>

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To meet with Viscountess Aisha Huxley.</font>

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said you had business with her 
at Baroness Godwin's ball, remember?</font>

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, her.</font>

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She might ignore a request
 for a meeting from a girl like me,</font>

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I thought I'd ask 
the House of O'Brian for a favor.</font>

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so good to see you, Constance.</font>

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been too long, Lady Abigail.</font>

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, but you are pretty!</font>

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those amethyst eyes 
and that scarlet dress...</font>

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, you could be a princess!</font>

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see you have taste, girl.</font>

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait... Huh? What?!</font>

27
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand the situation.</font>

28
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see to it that you receive
 an invitation from the Huxleys soon.</font>

29
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean you believe me?</font>

30
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've puzzled me 
all the while I've known you.</font>

31
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if Scarlett's by your side,
 that explains it.</font>

32
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Scarlett, can you hear me?</font>

33
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's over there, Abby!</font>

34
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Lucia.</font>

35
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your execution pained me deeply, 
so allow me to assist you.</font>

36
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? I wish you'd confine your jokes 
to that squashed frog you call a face.</font>

37
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... She says, yes, she understands!</font>

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't doubt 
she's insulting me as we speak.</font>

39
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea that anyone but me 
could see Scarlett.</font>

40
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My niece Lucia here
 was born with keen intuition.</font>

41
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anyone else has eyes 
like hers, it would be...</font>

42
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Viscount Hamsworth, I suppose. 
They say he has the goddesses' favor.</font>

43
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does he really?</font>

44
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard tell that the viscount 
can see unearthly beings.</font>

45
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you not think so, my lady?</font>

46
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It couldn't be... Could it?</i></font>

47
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget that nouveau riche hog.</font>

48
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're leaving, Connie.</font>

49
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do hope you'll speak 
to your fiancé about my request.</font>

50
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yes.</font>

51
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, if you'll excuse me!</font>

52
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teresa Jennings lost her life
 in an attempted murder-suicide.</font>

53
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her husband, Kevin Jennings, 
has become an invalid.</font>

54
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As far as Lady Abigail 
was able to discover,</font>

55
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daeg Gallus is selling the 
hallucinogen "Jackal's Paradise."</font>

56
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget all that and get what happened 
ten years ago out of Aisha.</font>

57
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of which,
 what was Aisha Huxley like?</font>

58
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, she used to be a gloomy, plain girl.</font>

59
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could say she was part of 
my entourage. Or a fan, I suppose.</font>

60
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I wore a red dress, so would Aisha.</font>

61
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I wore blue, she would too.
 In a similar style, no less.</font>

62
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'd even do her hair like mine.</font>

63
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And just the once, she looked me 
in the eye and spoke to me.</font>

64
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to be you.</font>

65
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how did you reply?</font>

66
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, that should be obvious.</font>

67
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world doesn't need 
<i>two</i> Scarlett Castiels.</font>

68
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Duke Castiel.</font>

69
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Randolph.</font>

70
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What's this urgent business you mentioned?</font>

71
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Permit me to be blunt.</font>

72
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to know 
about the Holy Grail of Eris.</font>

73
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, whatever could that be?</font>

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry to say
 the term is unfamiliar to me.</font>

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will that be all?</font>

76
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, for the time being.</font>

77
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A friendly word of warning.</font>

78
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Finish building your hand 
before you try to play it.</font>

79
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is the secret to a long life.</font>

80
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go over what we know.</font>

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll start with the attempt to poison 
Crown Princess Cecilia ten years ago,</font>

82
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when they found poison 
in one of her house's water jars.</font>

83
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What made people 
suspect you to begin with?</font>

84
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It went just as that schemer told you.</font>

85
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They found a moonbowstone 
earring just like mine</font>

86
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">lying beside the Luzes' water store.</font>

87
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As ill luck would have it, I'd called 
at the house just hours earlier.</font>

88
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was the earring really yours?</font>

89
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I had both of mine 
when I first fell under suspicion.</font>

90
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And did you...</font>

91
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell the investigators? Of course.</font>

92
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything I wore was one-of-a-kind
from the hands of master craftsmen.</font>

93
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Inquiring at their workshops 
would have substantiated as much.</font>

94
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why weren't you 
cleared of suspicion?</font>

95
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was told that, upon inspection, 
one of my earrings turned out to be fake.</font>

96
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They claimed I'd anticipated the
 investigation and prepared a replacement.</font>

97
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words,</font>

98
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">someone swapped one of mine</font>

99
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for the one found at the Luze estate
while it was in the Security Force's safe.</font>

100
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who would do such a thing?</font>

101
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know. But in the end,</font>

102
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the king authorized a search of my home.</font>

103
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one would dare touch the Castiel 
residence without a royal order.</font>

104
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, as you know, a half-empty vial 
of poison turned up in my chambers,</font>

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and they marched me off to a cell.</font>

106
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you suspect Crown Princess Cecilia?</font>

107
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose. She did benefit 
the most from my death.</font>

108
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So until just recently, I thought 
she'd orchestrated the whole thing.</font>

109
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only until recently?</font>

110
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be frank, I'm not sure anymore.</font>

111
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, she doesn't seem 
the least bit satisfied.</font>

112
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After ten whole years, she seems 
to loathe Enrique as much as ever.</font>

113
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And she doesn't seem attached 
to wealth or power, either.</font>

114
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what she's trying to achieve.</font>

115
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose we're still far from the truth.</font>

116
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True. But we have more than 
the events of ten years ago to go on.</font>

117
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something is happening now, and we can 
be certain Cecilia has a hand in it.</font>

118
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you remember what 
that red-haired reporter woman said?</font>

119
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia Luze was a whore's daughter
 raised in an orphanage.</font>

120
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Kevin Jennings, who got close 
to the truth, wound up an addict.</font>

121
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's right.</font>

122
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That merchant visiting her the very day
the seventh prince of Faris was abducted</font>

123
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">lines up too perfectly to be happenstance.</font>

124
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The merchant's name was, 
um... Vado, wasn't it?</font>

125
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, didn't the kidnapper 
have an accomplice called Salvador?</font>

126
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The names bear a similarity on paper. 
Coincidence, do you think?</font>

127
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they are the same person,</font>

128
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then we can assume Cecilia is 
involved with Daeg Gallus as well.</font>

129
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that they have a hand in distributing 
Jackal's Paradise on Rosenkreuz Street.</font>

130
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That young lady who collapsed at 
the Earl John Doe Ball, Kiara Grafton,</font>

131
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">used that hallucinogen, didn't she?</font>

132
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so did Kevin Jennings.</font>

133
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then Prince Ulysses's abduction,
Kate's kidnapping,</font>

134
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the spread of Jackal's Paradise 
are all Daeg Gallus's doing?</font>

135
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're forgetting one important thing.</font>

136
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daeg Gallus attacked <i>you</i> as well.</font>

137
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate Lorraine's kidnapper 
was after Lily's key, wasn't he?</font>

138
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just said that something's afoot now,
but that isn't precisely correct.</font>

140
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something has <i>been</i> afoot 
for the past ten years...</font>

141
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">right here in Adelbide.</font>

142
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be surprised if it had 
nothing to do with my execution.</font>

143
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True.</font>

144
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Whatever it is, Lady Lily probably 
lost her life because of it.</i></font>

145
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Destroy the Holy Grail of Eris"
 was her final message.</i></font>

146

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We still don't know what it means.</i></font>

147
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Your Lordship...</font>

148
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

149
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I realize we're to share information, 
but why at a museum?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It holds donations from 
the Orlamunde family.</font>

151
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought they might 
offer a clue to the key.</font>

152
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I visited here with Lily as well.</font>

153
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Of course...</i></font>

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They were on a first-name basis.</i></font>

155
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Of course.</i></font>

156
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Learn some tact!</font>

157

Anastasia received from the goddesses.</font>

158
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,510

159
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no! I mean...</font>

160
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for Abigail's request, 
 it will take some time.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The crown princess owns the hospital 
where Kevin Jennings is a patient.</font>

162
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll need to go through 
bothersome formalities.</font>

163
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

164
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett and I went over 
what happened ten years ago,</font>

165
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she says her earring was switched.</font>

166
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I read the file on the earrings.</font>

167
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one deemed an imitation 
wasn't made of moonbowstone</font>

168
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but rather a type of shell 
called silver-shell.</font>

169
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what of the design?</font>

170
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, Scarlett would like to know
 how the design compared.</font>

171
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was identical to her own earrings.</font>

172
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Silver-shell doesn't circulate
 by many routes.</font>

173
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I looked up who'd bought any at the time 
and found a familiar name:</font>

174
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Spencer family.</font>

175
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that...</font>

176
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Aisha's maiden name.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Spencers own several workshops

178
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,770

had replicas of my earrings made.</font>

179
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said you planned to visit 
the Huxleys to question her?</font>

180
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

181
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She may be involved with Daeg Gallus. 
Don't do anything rash.</font>

182
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't.</font>

183
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still don't feel a thing.</font>

184

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't remember anything either.</font>

185
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was I really executed here?</font>

191
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Aisha Spencer, aren't you?</font>

192
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been watching me.
 Just now, and earlier as well.</font>

193
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want?</font>

194
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you know, um, m-my name?</font>

195
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, you introduced yourself 
once at some other party.</font>

196
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You remember?</font>

197
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Naturally.</font>

198
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To whom do you imagine you're speaking?</font>

199
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome, Miss Grail. I'm sorry 
the house isn't much to look at.</font>

200
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all.</font>

201
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sincerely appreciate 
your invitation, Lady Huxley.</font>

202
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're only lesser nobility.</font>

203
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was shocked to receive 
a messenger from the O'Brians,</font>

204
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">though he came bearing 
a request from the Grails.</font>

205
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you'll forgive me. 
I simply had to see you.</font>

206
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't mind, 
I'd like to ask you a question.</font>

207
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's one I can answer, go ahead.</font>

208
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that smell?</font>

209
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An acquaintance of mine has 
an excellent nose and memory.</font>

210
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She could tell the instant you appeared.</font>

211
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me, Lady Huxley, why do you carry</font>

212
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the scent of Jackal's Paradise?</font>

213
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She noticed?!</i></font>

214
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever are you talking about?</font>

215
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jackal's Paradise? That hallucinogen 
that was all the rage a decade ago?</font>

216
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be mistaken.</font>

217
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am wearing a rare perfume today.
 Perhaps that's what you smell.</font>

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It comes from a distant land. 
I doubt you've heard of it.</font>

219
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a laughably poor liar.</font>

220
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How terribly rude!</font>

221
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't stand for this! Leave at once!</font>

222
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dear me.</font>

223
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Throwing a tantrum the moment 
your mischief comes to light?</font>

224
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You behave like an undisciplined child.</font>

225
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's come over me?</i></font>

226
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The same girl still stands before me,
 and yet I could almost...</i></font>

227
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mark my words, Aisha Spencer.</font>

228
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trying to fool me is far more 
offensive than anything I said.</font>

229
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To whom do you imagine you're speaking?</font>

00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett...?</font>

231
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, I'd never mistake anyone for her.</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ten years ago, Scarlett Castiel

233
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her and her fiancé, Crown Prince Enrique.</i></font>

234
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They didn't share anything

235
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I noticed they were

236
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How I idolized them.</i></font>

237
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But then </i>she<i> came along.</i></font>

238
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Talk of their star-crossed love in 
defiance of status spread like wildfire.</i></font>

239
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I knew the rumors would become truth
 unless someone stopped them.</i></font>

240
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought that I had to do 
something. And just then...</i></font>

241
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened, Sharon?</font>

242
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look so much thinner 
than when I last saw you.</font>

243
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used this.</font>

244
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's supposed to be a kind of foreign 
smelling salts. Worked wonders, didn't it?</font>

245
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One pinch is all it takes.</font>

246
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking too much is bad for your health.</font>

247
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,210

257
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,880

258
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea it was poison.</font>

259

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still have the bottle I used back then!</font>

261
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Check it and you'll see 
it's only a slimming drug!</font>

262
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't my fault!</font>

263
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please! Forgive me, Scarlett!</font>

264
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want my forgiveness?</font>

265
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why did you not confess your crime?</font>

266
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whether it was poison or not 
makes no difference.</font>

267
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, you knew that I was innocent.</font>

268
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I went to the executioner 
because of the crime you committed.</font>

269
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... I did it for you!</font>

270
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You would have done the same thing 
if you'd had the chance.</font>

271
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So in your place, I—</font>

272
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I</i>...</font>

273
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I</i> would rather die than do 
anything so disgraceful.</font>

274
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything you did ten years ago,
 you did for yourself.</font>

275
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do you think you are 
to use me as your excuse?</font>

276
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aisha Spencer,</font>

277
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">just for you, I will ask one last time...</font>

278
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To whom do you imagine you're speaking?</font>

279
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Deep down, I knew.</i></font>

280
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The answer has been staring me 
in the face all this time.</i></font>

281
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I merely shut my eyes to it 
to spare myself.</i></font>

282
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I caused it all.</i></font>

283
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I...</i></font>

284
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>killed Scarlett!</i></font>

285
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

286
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What good will dying do?!</font>

287
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your death won't undo 
what you did to Scarlett!</font>

288
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ought to live on and atone.</font>

 Jackal's Paradise.</font>

308

309

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should have just let her die!</font>

310

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Connie, you idiot! Why did you save her?!</font>
