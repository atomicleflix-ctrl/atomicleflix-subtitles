00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just so you know, Reggie—</font>

258
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop talking.</font>

259
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oho?</font>

260
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're wasting time.</font>

261
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's there?</font>

262
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing over there?</font>

263
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could ask you that.</font>

264
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you ever taken a bath 
while in your clothes?</font>

265
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never.</font>

266
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels better than I expected.</font>

267
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

268
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back when I was in elementary school,</font>

269
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I loved our classes on 
swimming in clothes.</font>

270
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So many things have stopped 
mattering lately,</font>

271
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I've been challenging myself to 
try things I assumed I shouldn't do.</font>

272
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've basically gone off the 
rails after hitting my mid-30s.</font>

273
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that funny?</font>

274
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's kind of amusing.</font>

275
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Higuruma, right?</font>

276
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the flesh.</font>

277
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to talk.</font>

278
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on. Wait, wait.</font>

279
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a lawyer.</font>

280
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talking to me will incur a consultation 
fee of 5,000 yen every half hour.</font>

281
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

282
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm kidding.</font>

283
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanted to try acting 
like a nasty lawyer for once.</font>

284
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

285
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's this guy doing?</i></font>

286
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have 100 points, right?</font>

287
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's not a past sorcerer 
who's been incarnated.</i></font>

288
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's a modern sorcerer whose 
technique was activated!</i></font>

289
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We can talk it out!</i></font>

290
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's room for negotiation!</i></font>

291
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah. You pass.</font>

292
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

293
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough. I can tell now.</font>

294
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's quite the shikigami.</font>

295
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're strong, right?</font>

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you were weak, I'd just 
kill you as another mark.</font>

297
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're good.</font>

298
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's work together.</font>

299
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What gives?!</i></font>

300
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I never heard about this!</i></font>

301
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you getting at?</font>

302
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much do you know 
about this Culling Game?</font>

303
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a ritual, right?</font>

304
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It uses the cursed energy of 
the Players inside the barriers</font>

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to ferry the people of 
Japan to the other side</font>

306
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and change them into something inhuman.</font>

307
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Guess I should stay quiet 
about Tengen-sama.</i></font>

308
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Do you know Kenjaku, then?</font>

309
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I knew there'd be one!</i></font>

310
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A sorcerer connected to Kenjaku!</i></font>

311
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, so, to be frank,</font>

312
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we want to stop the Culling Game.</font>

313
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, time out.</font>

314
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I say "stop it," I mean we want 
to negate the compulsory killing.</font>

315
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please let us use your 100 points 
to add a rule toward that end.</font>

316
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me to be frank, as well.</font>

317
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I refuse.</font>

318
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that another joke?</font>

319
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

320
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just sense potential 
in the Culling Game.</font>

321
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="12"><font color="#a3a466">Complete Book of the Six Codes</font></font></b></font></font>

322
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Sometimes the law is powerless.</font>

323
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what about the rules 
of this Culling Game?</font>

324
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the power I've been granted is real,</font>

325
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then those rules must be, too.</font>

326
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you just said about Players' 
cursed energy being used?</font>

327
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's probably a bluff.</font>

328
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

329
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, less of a bluff, 
and more Plan B or C.</font>

330
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have three reasons.</font>

331
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The number of Players.</font>

332
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The strength gap between Players.</font>

333
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The barriers' rules.</font>

334
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If roughly 1,000 people were equally 
split up between the ten Colonies,</font>

335
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that would be 100 per Colony.</font>

336
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But among the Players are sorcerers</font>

337
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">like Kashimo or Higuruma,</font>

338
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who are much stronger than the rest.</font>

339
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These two alone have already 
culled sixty sorcerers.</font>

340
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's probably one like 
them in each Colony.</font>

341
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the weak are weeded out early on,</font>

342
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the Culling Game 
will reach a stalemate?</font>

343
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I certainly did sense that.</i></font>

344
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Colony has been too quiet.</i></font>

345
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It already has.</font>

346
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least here in Tokyo No. 1.</font>

347
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On top of that, there's the teleportation 
when people enter the Colony.</font>

348
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It serves to spread them out,</font>

349
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but its main goal is likely to encourage</font>

350
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">an early second awakening 
of modern sorcerers.</font>

351
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are some who die during 
the teleportation, too.</font>

352
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he was really trying to use 
the Players' cursed energy,</font>

353
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he would want the greatest 
number of sorcerers</font>

354
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to fight for the longest time possible.</font>

355
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What if people who broke the 
rules were punished by physics,</font>

356
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without any need for indictments, 
prosecutions, or arguments at trials?</font>

357
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't that be wonderful?</font>

358
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll acknowledge there are 
issues with the current rules,</font>

359
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I want to watch over the system 
serving as a basis for this game.</font>

360
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It won't do for it to end too soon.</font>

361
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd especially love to witness 
the stripping of a technique</font>

362

363
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,560

364
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's better for the rules if 
being stripped means death, too.</font>

365
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Culling Game itself is a ritual.</font>

370
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me rephrase it, then.</font>

371
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me use your 100 points, Higuruma!</font>

who ticked you off?</font>

373
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels much better than I expected.</font>

374
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A shikigami?!</i></font>
