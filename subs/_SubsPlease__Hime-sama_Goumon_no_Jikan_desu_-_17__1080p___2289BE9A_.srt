00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Tis time for torture, Princess.</font>

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today's torture is...</font>

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Japanese rice pilaf.</font>

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Japanese rice pilaf?!</font>

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Curses!</font>

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of rice pilaf is it?!</font>

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's</i> what you're worried about?</font>

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it a classic 
five-ingredient Japanese pilaf?</font>

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or a salmon and mushroom pilaf?</font>

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or maybe it's a baby sardine 
and seaweed pilaf!</font>

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you know so much 
about rice pilafs?</font>

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Without further ado...</font>

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us begin the torture, Princess.</font>

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I forgot to turn on the rice cooker!</font>

15
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,000
<font size="20" color="#000000"><b><font color="#d01c76">{\an8}<font size="32">'Tis Time for <font color="#020000">"Torture,"

16
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe I made 
such a basic mistake...</font>

17
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry, Princess.</font>

18
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't beat yourself up so much, Torture!</font>

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone makes mistakes.</font>

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you forgot to cook it, 
you can just do it now!</font>

21
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feel free to use one 
of my cell's sockets!</font>

22
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will that be all right?</font>

23
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I start it now, it'll take 
about fifty minutes to cook.</font>

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course it's fine.</font>

25
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can spend our time waiting 
having a nice one-on-one chat.</font>

26
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Princess...</font>

27
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this what you'd call a torturous wait?</font>

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Torturous wait?</font>

29
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, is that right?</font>

30
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-huh.</font>

31
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just the other day, the three of us 
were playing a fighting game...</font>

32
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep practicing those combos!</font>

33
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get consistent with your short hops!</font>

34
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At first, it was You-chan 
and I teaching In-chan...</font>

35
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But before we knew it, 
In-chan was better than both of us.</font>

36
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have done 
a good job teaching her.</font>

37
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You think?</font>

38
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm sure that played a role.</font>

39
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I <i>am</i> a legion commander, after all!</font>

40
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Part of my job as commander 
was teaching new recruits.</font>

41
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't get many other chances 
to interact with people,</font>

42
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I had a lot of fun training them.</font>

43
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd also befriend the few 
girls I met who were my age.</font>

44
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We even used to have 
tea parties together.</font>

45
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds lovely.</font>

46
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of which...</font>

47
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A new recruit has joined us recently.</font>

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It won't be for some time, 
but she'll be torturing you, too.</font>

50
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah? I'll look forward to it.</font>

51
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's funny how this 
sounds normal to me now.</font>

52
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know...</font>

53
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've never really had 
a nice, long talk like this before.</font>

54
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose we haven't.</font>

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Tis a common occurrence 
when you meet for work all the time.</font>

56
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess so.</font>

57
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We got to spend this time 
because you forgot to cook the rice.</font>

58
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it was for the best, in a way.</font>

59
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had fun talking 
about all this stuff with you.</font>

60
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did, too.</font>

61
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like it's done.</font>

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

63
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time to get to surrendering.</font>

65
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm glad I got to talk to Torture 
for so long today.</i></font>

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I managed to remember 
a lot about the past.</i></font>

67
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh yeah, I forgot I used to keep 
a diary before I came here.</i></font>

68
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm pretty sure I wrote in it the day 
before I was captured...</i></font>

69
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong?</font>

70
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

71
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh? Did I remember to put my diary away?</i></font>

72
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I put it back in the drawer 
and locked it up, didn't I?</i></font>

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Did I? I did, didn't I?</i></font>

74
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness?</font>

75
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can remember writing in it
but not putting it away.</i></font>

76
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Did I leave it out on my desk?</i></font>

77
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That'd mean anyone could read it 
if they entered my room!</i></font>

78
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't let that happen!</i></font>

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to do something about this!</i></font>

80
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Tis time for torture, Princess.</font>

81
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I yield!</font>

82
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

83
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Torture hasn't brought anything out yet!</font>

84
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The castle's west tower, fourth floor.</font>

85
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The room at the very end. 
That's the weak point.</font>

86
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Burn it down!</font>

87
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness?!</font>

88
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least wait and see what it is 
before you surrender!</font>

89
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Follow the proper surrender etiquette!</font>

90
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, what the hell 
is "surrender etiquette"?!</font>

91
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there a reason you're 
so desperate to give in?</font>

92
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see...</font>

93
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that was it.</font>

94
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You forgot to put your diary away?</font>

95
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

96
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd do anything to stop my diary 
from being read!</font>

97
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The humiliation!</font>

98
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you really forget to put it away?</font>

99
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure.</font>

100
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, the possibility is low.</font>

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now, I can't get 
the idea out of my head!</font>

102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Burn it all down...</font>

103
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't wish 
for your homeland to burn down.</font>

104
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid burning 
the castle down is not an option.</font>

105
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I can see if you'd be 
allowed to temporarily return.</font>

106
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a chance they'd say yes to that?</font>

107
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why can't I remember if I put it away?</font>

108
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can remember picking up 
the book I use as my diary...</font>

109
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By diary, do you perhaps mean...</font>

110
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a book with the Royal 
Empire's emblem on it?</font>

111
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? How do you know that?</font>

112
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Among your possessions...</font>

113
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! That's right!</font>

114
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I put it in my bag since we 
were setting out on a long expedition!</font>

115
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then I was captured, which means...</font>

116
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

117
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's in the Hellhorde's custody now.</font>

118
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Wait, then...</font>

119
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad I didn't leave it on my desk!</font>

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anyone had read it, 
I'd pass out foaming at the mouth!</font>

121
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see now.</font>

122
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that book was your diary.</font>

123
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eh?</font>

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought it was a poetry collection 
since it was so romantic.</font>

125
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah.</font>

126
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you really <i>did</i> read it?</font>

127
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have the wrong idea, Princess!</font>

128
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In case it held any imperial information,</font>

129
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to go through all of your belongings 
with our intelligence unit!</font>

130
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I ask how much of her diary you read?</font>

131
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please accept my apologies.</font>

132
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We read through it in its entirety.</font>

133
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness?</font>

134
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness?</font>
