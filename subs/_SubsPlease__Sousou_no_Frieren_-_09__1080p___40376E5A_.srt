32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember now.</font>

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was Frieren.</font>

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mage who contributed significantly 
to humanity's analysis of Zoltraak</font>

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and slew more demons 
than anyone else in history.</font>

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren the Slayer.</font>

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of the geniuses I despise.</font>

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,010
<font face="Times New Roman">{\an7}<font color="#f7fffa">Episode 9: Aura the Guillotine</font></font>

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll have to rest for a while.</font>

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

42
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of you, I'll survive.</font>

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have my thanks.</font>

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll pardon your mage companion as well.</font>

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was right.</font>

47
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now Frieren can return to town.</font>

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's have her defeat Lügner 
and the other demon.</font>

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren didn't kill the guard.</font>

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know. The demons did it.</font>

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly, 
that mage's name is Frieren?</font>

52
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

53
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The elven mage who adventured with the Hero?</font>

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I've committed a grave discourtesy.</font>

55
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Granat family owes the 
party of heroes a debt.</font>

56
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When this town was attacked by demons 
during my grandfather's rule,</font>

57
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they were the ones who drove them off.</font>

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They faced the same enemy as we do now.</font>

59
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was Aura, one of the 
Seven Sages of Destruction.</font>

60
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been a while, Aura.</font>

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, Frieren. About eighty years, I'd say.</font>

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're heading to the town 
up ahead, aren't you?</font>

63
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd appreciate it if you turned back.</font>

64
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?</font>

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I have an overwhelming advantage.</font>

67
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have more puppets than before.</font>

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demon magic must be unbelievably 
powerful to control this many.</font>

70
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humanity's magic could never 
dream of reaching such heights.</font>

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But your magic couldn't be more disgusting.</font>

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes me want to puke.</font>

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a nice thing to say.</font>

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It took a lot of work to gather this many.</font>

75
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I recognize some of those suits of armor.</font>

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aura, it seems I must 
kill you here after all.</font>

77
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Scales of Obedience.</font>

78
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the reason we haven't been able 
to defeat Aura in all these years.</font>

79
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her magic allows her to force 
others to obey her will.</font>

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The magics of the Seven Sages of Destruction</font>

81
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are beyond human knowledge and reason.</font>

82
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aura places her own soul 
and that of her target on the scales</font>

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and weighs the magnitude of 
their mana against each other.</font>

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one with greater mana 
gains control of the other,</font>

85
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:47,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">turning them into a puppet for all eternity—
until their body withers to dust.</font>

86
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a risky spell, but that's 
what makes it powerful.</font>

87
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in the hands of someone with mana 
as tremendous as Aura, it's unbeatable.</font>

88
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there no way to counter it?</font>

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though the weight of Aura's mana 
is enough to fully tip the scales,</font>

90
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the scales themselves do judge fairly.</font>

91
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If a soul with greater mana than Aura's 
were to be placed on the scales,</font>

92
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aura could be defeated.</font>

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they say that hasn't happened 
once in the five hundred years</font>

94
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">since Aura became a Sage of Destruction.</font>

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then there's no way to fight it?</font>

96
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was.</font>

97
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those with powerful wills could 
temporarily resist the spell.</font>

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The greater the individual, 
the more iron their will.</font>

99
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And even then, it was only temporary?</font>

100
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it was a fatal flaw.</font>

101
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The strong-willed must have been 
an obstacle to her.</font>

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

103
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aura the Guillotine dealt with them in the 
most logical way after gaining control.</font>

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a tragic tale.</font>

105
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? My immortal army 
is powerful, isn't it?</font>

106
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised.</font>

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dispelled the magic I'd cast on them.</font>

108
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one's ever done that before.</font>

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such powerful dispelling magic must expend 
a considerable amount of mana.</font>

110
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you use such a roundabout method?</font>

111
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The last time we fought, you blew them away 
with flashy spells left and right.</font>

112
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel scolded me afterward.</font>

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that's all the more reason 
not to do this.</font>

114
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

115
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel is long gone, isn't he?</font>

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Good.</font>

117
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You demons are monsters after all.</font>

118
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can kill you without mercy.</font>

119
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've regained most of my mobility.</font>

121
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Father, this place is safe, right?</font>

122
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. It's not as strong as the 
town's defensive barrier,</font>

123
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there is a barrier around this church.</font>

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then wait here, Graf.</font>

125
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brat, what do you plan to do?</font>

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think the demons will just leave 
if we all hole up in here?</font>

127
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark, are you serious?</font>

128
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We only landed that hit before 
because we caught him off guard.</font>

129
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We couldn't find enough of an 
opening to finish him off.</font>

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we'd kept fighting, we would 
have been the ones killed.</font>

131
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone's gotta do this, right?</font>

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. Then let's 
do our best together.</font>

133
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you go to the guard station.</font>

134
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to evacuate the townsfolk.</font>

135
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you're going to...</font>

136
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

137
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to...</font>

138
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">get on my hands and knees 
and beg Frieren to return.</font>

139
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

140
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! Having her defeat him 
is our only option!</font>

141
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose that's more realistic.</font>

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guards will listen to you 
if you show them this.</font>

143
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

144
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm heading straight out of town.</font>

145
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

146
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your arm is in a terrible state.</font>

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you pass through the castle gate 
looking like that?</font>

148
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be fine. This is normal for a warrior.</font>

149
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there something weird about it?</font>

150
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen a warrior walk 
around town with two bloody hands.</font>

151
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're one to talk. You're 
covered in blood, too.</font>

152
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Whose blood is this?</font>

153
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not mine.</font>

154
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! What's the matter with—</font>

155
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark, there's mana in this blood.</font>

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern!</font>

157
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>An axe?</i></font>

158
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe it. Am I dreaming?</font>

159
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was my master's technique.</font>

160
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd meant to hit your vitals, 
but then you went and moved.</font>

161
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't my intention to make you suffer.</font>

162
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you surprised?</font>

163
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it because I'm standing here when 
I supposedly suffered a fatal blow?</font>

164
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or because you didn't detect our approach?</font>

165
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't the only one who knows how to 
conceal her presence by controlling her mana.</font>

166
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any demon can do it.</font>

167
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, it's hardly fitting 
for a battle between mages.</font>

168
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure like to talk.</font>

169
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you going to finish me off?</font>

170
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I failed to kill you instantly, 
I thought I'd ask you some questions.</font>

171
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or would you rather die right now?</font>

172
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead.</font>

173
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that boy strong?</font>

174
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's Eisen the Warrior's best student.</font>

175
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. How unfortunate.</font>

176
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poor boy.</font>

177
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won't die a decent death 
at Linie's hands.</font>

178
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One more question.</font>

179
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is Frieren?</font>

180
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She fled the town</font>

181
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because you killed the dungeon guard.</font>

182
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Granat said something similar.</font>

183
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Killing a guard is a serious crime, it seems.</font>

184
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The punishment is execution.</font>

185
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Execution?</font>

186
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wouldn't be enough 
to make that woman flee.</font>

187
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She holds a powerful grudge against demons,</font>

188
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">enough to teach her own student 
a spell purely for demon-killing.</font>

189
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone like that wouldn't run.</font>

190
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must be after something.</font>

191
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be Lady Aura.</font>

192
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't move.</font>

193
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know where Ms. Frieren 
is headed, don't you?</font>

194
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wasting your time.</font>

195
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You lied about failing to kill me.</font>

196
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanted revenge for my surprising you.</font>

197
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're proud and arrogant.</font>

198
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still don't see us—see anyone 
besides Ms. Frieren as a threat.</font>

199
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why you granted me an opportunity.</font>

200
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From this distance, I can blast 
a hole clean through your heart.</font>

201
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try it.</font>

202
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your head will fly before 
you get the chance.</font>

203
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, am I useful?</font>

204
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you ask that?</font>

205
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not as good at magic as you are.</font>

206
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've lived for much longer than you.</font>

207
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that regard, you'll never catch up to me.</font>

208
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

209
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that only applies to mana and technique.</font>

210
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I often let you handle 
battles against monsters.</font>

211
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you've forced those on me many times.</font>

212
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, okay?</font>

213
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But battles end quicker when you fight</font>

214
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because you fire off spells 
faster than I do.</font>

215
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girl, I have dedicated the majority 
of my life to the pursuit of magic.</font>

216
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So have I.</font>

217
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How is she responding so quickly?</i></font>

218
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I hadn't reflexively defended myself, 
that would've pierced my heart.</i></font>

219
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You blocked it.</font>

220
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So your heart is your weak point.</font>

221
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This girl...</i></font>

222
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

223
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You weren't lying about 
dedicating your life to magic.</font>

224
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I shall crush you with all my might.</font>

225
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Balterie.</font>

226
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like they've begun as well.</font>

227
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a shame, though.</font>

228
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're nearly finished here.</font>

229
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps I'll observe their battle.</font>

230
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner gets cross when I interfere.</font>

231
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

232
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not finished yet.</font>

233
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're tough. Perhaps I'll be 
able to enjoy this a little.</font>

234
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My mana, technique, and control 
are all far greater than hers.</i></font>

235
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This girl cannot compare to me.</i></font>

236
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>However, she's fast.</i></font>

237
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm being overwhelmed by the sheer 
number of attacks, pure and simple.</i></font>

238
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Damn you, Frieren. 
How did you train this girl?</i></font>

239
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll engage her in a battle of attrition 
and wait for her to exhaust her mana.</i></font>

240
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, I can't.</i></font>

241
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The battle will be over before then.</i></font>

242
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I could just create an opening...</i></font>

243
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Linie, what are you doing?</font>

244
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up and defeat him!</font>

245
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, how selfish.</font>

246
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's refusing to do anything 
but fight defensively.</font>

247
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are you wielding your axe like that?</font>

248
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are my master's techniques.</font>

249
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm skilled at reading mana.</font>

250
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I memorize the flow of mana 
inside a person when they move</font>

251
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and imitate their movements.</font>

252
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like this.</font>

253
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it from the first time I saw 
your movements at the mansion.</font>

254
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're the same as those of the 
powerful warrior I once memorized.</font>

255
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coincidences really do happen.</font>

256
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fate is an interesting thing.</font>

257
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't mean...</font>

258
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am imitating the movements 
of Eisen the Warrior.</font>

259
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Seriously? This is crazy.</i></font>

260
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't win this fight.</i></font>

261
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He finally fell.</font>

262
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must hurry.</font>

263
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner will be upset with me again.</font>

264
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Fell"? Have I fallen?</i></font>

265
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stand up, Stark.</font>

266
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter how battered you get, 
you cannot fall.</font>

267
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but there's no way I can beat you.</font>

268
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course you can't.</font>

269
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm stronger than you.</font>

270
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then...</font>

271
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you got back up.</font>

272
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That means you haven't lost yet.</font>

273
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of logic is that?</font>

274
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, I'll teach you the secret 
to defeating powerful opponents.</font>

275
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's simple.</font>

276
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep getting back up and hitting them.</font>

277
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For warriors, whoever's still standing 
at the end is the winner.</font>

278
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it, Master.</font>

279
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and your weird logic.</font>

280
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess your brain's made of muscles,
 like the rest of you.</font>

281
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should've just stayed down.</font>

282
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You already lost.</font>

283
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm still standing.</font>

284
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I remember now.</font>

285
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My master's blows were heavier.</font>

286
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yours are just imitations after all.</font>

287
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I will use those imitations 
to send you to your end.</font>

288

but I shouldn't have been so scared.</font>

293

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your attacks don't have any 
weight behind them at all.</font>
