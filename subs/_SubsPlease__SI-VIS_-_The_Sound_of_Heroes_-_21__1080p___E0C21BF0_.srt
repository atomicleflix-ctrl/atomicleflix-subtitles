3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a persistent lot.</font>

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're after the new Diva.</i></font>

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They won't have an emotional

00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chill out a bit, Apollo.</font>

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me take care of them this time.</font>

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for leading them here, Medea.</font>

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,220

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In exchange, I want to ask you a favor.</font>

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Mirage appeared 
simultaneously in 25 locations.</font>

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention...</font>

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're all political hubs.</font>

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no logic 
in setting targets like this.</font>

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an attack solely to put 
the whole Earth in chaos.</font>

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knew they'd be the one 
to give us a signal?</font>

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. They don't care
about the consequences.</font>

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means our kids 
are closing in on Nagi.</font>

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now this is a race, SI-VIS.</font>

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you take me down first
or does Earth perish before that?</font>

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,670

48
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, wow! How are you doing this?</font>

49
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Connecting Harmonia and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not Earth technology. 
It's <i>my</i> skill.</font>

52
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we're ready for the live concert.</font>

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we can't tell what's really 
going on over there.</font>

54
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're the stage director 
of SI-VIS today, Medea.</font>

55
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always do my best.</font>

56
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the rest is up to SI-VIS.</font>

57
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cold!</font>

58
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you say something that will, 
I don't know, boost our morale?</font>

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which makes you, Rui, 
the supervisor for today.</font>

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Work with her and
 lead the concert to success.</font>

61
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you can trust her that much?</font>

62
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shouldn't you trust her more than anyone?</font>

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As women who loved the same man.</font>

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can sympathize with her, can't you?</font>

65
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to Harmonia headquarters,</font>

66
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we have about thirty minutes
before the Mirages close.</font>

67
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to rescue the Diva 
before that and stop the Mirages.</font>

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a race against time.</font>

69
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say that, but will saving Nagi 
really stop the Mirages?</font>

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The situation on Earth
must be dealt with,</font>

71
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but rushing into things 
just to fail won't help.</font>

72
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we should take our chances 
with the time limit of thirty minutes.</font>

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because that man is most likely 
playing games with you.</font>

74
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on. Come on. Come on!</font>

75
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will reunite you guys.</font>

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like Romeo and
Juliet on your planet.</font>

77
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that...?</font>

78
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya is here.</font>

79
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Archon was right.</font>

80
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we use her, we can revive XENOS 
without relying on Earth.</font>

81
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I am Kyoya of SI-VIS.</i></font>

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll make sure everyone survives!</i></font>

83
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How fortuitous.</font>

84
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With Earth and 
the new Diva on our side,</font>

85
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">our revival will be a
 hundred years closer.</font>

86
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Medea-san, are these...?</font>

87
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, the people of XENOS.</font>

88
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They placed their hope of resurrection 
in us and went to sleep.</font>

89
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Mirage?!</font>

90
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the heck is that?</font>

91
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A trap?</font>

92
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. This is most likely 
a trap as well as a chance.</font>

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's only one XENOS left who 
would do something dramatic like this.</font>

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know! It's that pervy old man!</font>

95
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can no longer tell 
what Samael's true intention is.</font>

96
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it feels to me like it is 
very personal and impulsive.</font>

97
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He wants to fight us?</font>

98
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure he's waiting for us with 
a hostage of one plus billions of people.</font>

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean Nagi and...</font>

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lives of the earthlings.</font>

101
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we crush this Mirage, then the Mirages 
on Earth should disappear as well.</font>

102
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wouldn't make sense to
put on a show like this otherwise.</font>

103
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then all we do is to take the bait 
with everything we've got.</font>

104
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, just do it as usual, okay?</font>

105
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until the live concert begins...</font>

106
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or until those 25 cities disappear, 
we've got 15 minutes left.</font>

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What emotions are you going through?</font>

108
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right, everyone?!</font>

109
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Medea-san!</font>

110
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now's not the time to worry about me!</font>

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Telling him that is pointless.</font>

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can't even protect himself, 
but he tries to protect everyone.</font>

113
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's mean.</font>

114
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

115
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A revived cyborg?</font>

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As expected of the pervy old man.</font>

117
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew he had bad taste, but this is peak.</font>

118
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here goes our all-out attack.</font>

119
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, let's go!</font>

120
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's not it!</font>

121
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just do our usual.</font>

122
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave this to us and keep going!</font>

123
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soji, μ...</font>

124
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a race against time!</font>

125
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our combat power won't change 
that much if you aren't here!</font>

126
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

127
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you'd be better off 
if we weren't with you.</font>

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet there'll be a full display 
of embarrassing lines like,</font>

129
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Give back my Nagi, 
you scoundrel!" and whatnot.</font>

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, come on! You guys 
never listen to me!</font>

131
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll go do my solo.</font>

132
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we'll do the next
song with the full cast!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going, too!</font>

134
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please. I need you to back him up.</font>

135
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure our leader looks cool, will you?</font>

136
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Our leader"?</i></font>

137
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is that how a leader should be?</i></font>

138
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Orphe led and guided 
everyone from the front.</i></font>

139
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He produced results on his own.</i></font>

140
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He never showed his weakness.</i></font>

141
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But that boy...</i></font>

142
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but leave the princess 
and I alone, will you?</font>

143
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've done your bidding so far, haven't I?</font>

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yo, Princess.</font>

145
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya is coming.</font>

146
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, your knight will arrive soon.</font>

147
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To kill me.</font>

148
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wrong.</font>

149
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya won't kill or hate.</font>

150
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a true hero who saves everyone.</font>

151
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I kinda need him 
to fight me, you know?</font>

152
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Otherwise, there's no 
growing stronger, you see?</font>

153
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nagi!</font>

154
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome to my homeland!</font>

155
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,060

157
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya!</font>

158
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Set Nagi free!</font>

159
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want your princess back, 
try and stop this Mirage.</font>

160
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you manage to do it, 
I'll give you a reward!</font>

161
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll stop every Mirage 
on Earth, not just here.</font>

162
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because its core is right here.</font>

163
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must stop this, Samael!</font>

164
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You touched her power, didn't you?</font>

165
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you must have realized</font>

166
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that there's a way for both 
XENOS and the earthlings</font>

167
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to survive without taking Earth!</font>

168
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apollo, Orphe, you...</font>

169
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why can't you be a bit more flexible?</font>

170
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who cares about the future 
of the human species?</font>

171
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samael!</font>

172
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have known...</font>

173
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What we're doing to take Earth.</font>

174
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What we have done.</font>

175
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:35,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our friends who entrusted the future 
of XENOS to us and went to sleep...</font>

176
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our friends who went to sleep, 
believing that they'd wake up one day...</font>

177
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've consumed their lives to be here.</font>

178
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why... That's exactly why!</i></font>

179
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Now might be our chance 
to stop the cycle of loss.</i></font>

180
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is a one-in-a-million chance!</i></font>

181
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

182
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should stick to your beliefs, Medea.</font>

183
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I will do the same.</font>

184
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, Samael?!</font>

185
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that all you have to say?</font>

186
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is Lord Apollo's opinion?!</font>

187
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't imagine him 
tolerating your reckless behavior!</font>

188
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True, Apollo probably wouldn't 
condone my <i>purpose</i>.</font>

189
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he'd allow me to destroy 
SI-VIS to gain Earth.</font>

190
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how he is.</font>

191
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That can't be...!</font>

192
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't have anyone 
to protect, find someone.</font>

193
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get to know someone well enough 
that they're no longer a stranger!</font>

194
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear that, Medea?</font>

195
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about you?</font>

196
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You lost Orphe, the only love you had.
Can you say the same thing?</font>

197
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orphe might be gone, 
but his wishes will live on forever.</font>

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For people he's never met, 
for people from different cultures...</font>

199
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and even for people 
who are yet to be born,</font>

200

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he served his mission and gave his life.</font>

201
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to be someone like that as well.</font>

202
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

203
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you blessed to be able to live on 
with just the memories of loved ones?</font>

204
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you're just caught up in a curse.</font>

205
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a foolish way to live!</font>

206
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will stop you, Samael!</font>

207
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nagi and I, with the song of SI-VIS!</font>

208
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead and try.</font>

209
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,860
