<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't underestimate a former SI-VIS!</font>

77
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it, this doesn't make sense.</font>

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're not even attacking us.</font>

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">XENOS, what are you trying to do?</font>

80
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">μ...</font>

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry!</font>

82
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stick together, and there's 
nothing to be scared of!</font>

83
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we'll go home together, Nagi.</font>

84
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back to Kyoya!</font>

85
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm afraid it won't be that easy.</font>

86
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because our objective is—</font>

87
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, there!</font>

88
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This takes me back, old man!</font>

89
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one attacked us, so I felt lonely.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, now! SI-VIS girls 
are quick to lose their temper—</font>

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess the secondary form has its limits.</font>

94
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Nagi!</font>

95
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Oh, boy.</font>

96
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might get yelled at for this later.</font>

97
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm.</font>

98
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Front and back entrances, 
second-floor window,</font>

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">underground parking lot, it's all bust.</font>

100
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We get tossed out.</font>

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does this mean the whole building 
is covered in the Mirage?</font>

102
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a different type of 
application than we've seen,</font>

103
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm sure it's similar technology.</font>

104
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, aren't they...?</font>

105
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do we get inside?</font>

106
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To connect with the Mirage,</font>

107
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we need the backstage stuff and the staff.
 Both are inside the building.</font>

108
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Metis as well.</font>

109
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means that right now, we have 
no way of connecting with the Mirage.</font>

110
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm...</font>

111
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, how about what we did when we jumped 
out of the helicopter the other day?</font>

112
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wasn't your power.</font>

113
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hayama-san said it was Nagi-chan's power.</font>

114
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's right!</font>

115
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Nagi's also trapped 
in here, we can't use it.</font>

116
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we can use it!</font>

117
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was inside and I was 
outside of the Mirage back then.</font>

118
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we just need to do the same.</font>

119
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you were able to touch 
Nagi directly at back then.</font>

120
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This time, we don't 
even know where she is.</font>

121
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then there's nothing we...</font>

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just need to deliver it.</font>

123
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our location to her!</font>

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me, what is your purpose?</font>

125
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't even start to guess 
what kind of technology you use,</font>

126
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I can tell the difference 
in its strength.</font>

127
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I hate to admit it, but I can tell 
that you're holding back on me, too.</font>

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh no, I did go all-out.</font>

129
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I'm running multiple 
applications, this is my limit.</font>

130
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, it's true that I'm personally
not interested in killing you right away.</font>

131
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because that'd be</font>

132
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">boring, you know?</font>

133
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,720

135
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was only going to lure in the diva.</font>

136
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I guess this is within 
the margin of error.</font>

137
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Attacking without even
hearing what I have to say?</font>

138
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so barbaric!</font>

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the invader 
who attacked out of nowhere,</font>

140
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I don't want to hear it!</font>

of Eden the Diva.</font>

146
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,180

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Medea.</font>

148
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to this planet 
to tell you the truth.</font>

149
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the record 
your friend left behind.</font>

150
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, a video?</font>

151
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yosuke and Nagi? What is this?</font>

152
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see you're not surprised.</font>

153
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nagi?</font>

154
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somehow... Somehow I knew it.</font>

155
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That I wasn't like Kyoya and μ.</font>

156
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. You are one of us.</font>

157
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a member of the tribe 
those around you shun as "invaders."</font>

158
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Orphe is as well.</font>

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the XENOS you all called "Yosuke."</font>

160
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the one who betrayed us, kidnapped 
you, and brought Earth into this war.</font>

161
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the main culprit.</font>

162
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You named the diva "Nagi," 
and you never told her who she was.</font>

163
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never told the members 
of SI-VIS who Orphe was.</font>

164
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you were afraid 
that it would sever their bond,</font>

165
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and SI-VIS would fall apart.</font>

166
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was only looking for 
the right time to tell them.</font>

167
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly, they were too young 
and immature to bear this secret.</font>

168
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

169
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a sensitive subject.</font>

170
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I get where you're coming from.</font>

171
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But right now, your indecisiveness 
will be our advantage.</font>

172
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The diva will probably feel that 
you betrayed her, you know?</font>

173
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And SI-VIS won't be able to accept 
the truth about Orphe, you know?</font>

174
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Diva, you have a power 
that no earthling possesses.</font>

175
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not just the earthlings.</font>

176
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even amongst us, your power 
to share and give Idea is very special.</font>

177
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a power that can single-handedly 
change the fate of a planet.</font>

178
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've come here to return 
your power to its rightful place.</font>

179
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need y—</font>

180
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Kyoya.</font>

181
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! This is Kyoya! Right, Nagi?</font>

182
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

183
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, what's going on?</font>

184
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nagi, you met Kyoya when you were a kid?!</font>

185
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes, I remembered it at that cave.</font>

186
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right! The cave on the island!</font>

187
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you shut up?</font>

188
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Woo, we can so use this!</font>

189
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A friend you've met as a child 
but was somehow forgotten!</font>

190
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention you saved his life!</font>

191
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is like an ultra-top-class 
Goddess of Fortune stuff!</font>

192
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You think so?</font>

193
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, what an awesome material!</font>

194
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we can teach Kyoya a le—</font>

195
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, get his attention, Nagi!</font>

196
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Do you really think it'll be that easy?</font>

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Why not?</font>

198
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-Because the diva is XENOS.</font>

199
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And therefore incompatible with you...</font>

200
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The adversity is exactly why 
their romance will heat up!</font>

201
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't XENOS understand 
something so simple?</font>

202
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What are y—</font>

203
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe how dumb you are.</font>

204
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That silly boy Kyoya</font>

205
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will never have a change of heart over 
something trivial like Nagi being XENOS!</font>

206
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">μ, you were mad just a second ago 
that Kyoya had a change of heart.</font>

207
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whose side are you on?!</font>

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, I'm trying to tear down 
this old hag, so work with me here!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Old hag"?</font>

210
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you give it a try?</font>

211
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Test the bond of SI-VIS right now.</font>

212
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Challenge how much 
they care for each other!</font>

213
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if SI-VIS collapses 
from internal disunity,</font>

214
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then it's on us, the management team, 
for failing to foster them.</font>

215
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll take responsibility.</font>

216
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But do you really think 
it will work out so smoothly?</font>

220
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,080

isn't something to take lightly.</font>

221
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That should've been more than enough 
for your trust and love to waver—</font>

225
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,810

226
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can go anywhere.</font>
