<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Yuri. Morning!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Comet...</font>

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's the party going?</font>

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Party?</font>

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been over since yesterday.</font>

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, get a grip.</font>

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll never loop again.</i></font>

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ooh, Yurinchy!</font>

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna get something to eat together?</font>

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You good?</font>

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess your memories are still affected.</font>

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you'll eventually get it.</font>

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That person doesn't exist IRL!</font>

25
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,580

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is an entirely separate world

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Once they went over there, all trace

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's as though they never existed at all.</i></font>

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

31
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The military has issued a request 
for us to dock at port.</i></font>

32
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be because we escaped from Liu-An.</font>

33
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But LeVi already confirmed that 
there were no Gnosia on board.</font>

34
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They probably just want to be sure.</font>

35
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're pretty wary 
about that kind of thing.</font>

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd better do as they say. 
You don't want to be on their bad side.</font>

37
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If we ignore the request, they will 
take us into custody as per space law.</i></font>

38
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's not a request. 
It's actually an order.</font>

39
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A military port... They'll check 
our identities, won't they?</font>

40
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're just intimidating us. 
I doubt they'll follow through.</font>

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can simply ignore them.</font>

42
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I concur. We have no time 
to play along with their farce.</font>

43
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if they <i>do</i> follow through, 
we'll be in a lot of trouble.</font>

44
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We <i>just</i> got outta Liu-An

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna just end up in the slammer.</font>

46
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm... What do you think?</font>

47
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

48
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a soldier, right?</font>

49
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I came from Base 52.</font>

50
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The military...</i></font>

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think we should stop by.</font>

52
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What shall we do?</font>

53
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Willows bend, not break, 
beneath the weight of snow.</font>

54
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us follow their orders.</font>

55
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are changing route!</font>

56
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call sign sent!</font>

57
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let them take control of the helm!</font>

58
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As you wish.</i></font>

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Approach confirmed.</i></font>

60
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The military requests that we disable 
all of the ship's defense systems.</i></font>

61
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Shall we accept?</i></font>

62
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

63
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Request accepted.</i></font>

64
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All defense systems will now be disabled.</i></font>

65
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, are we gonna be able 
to get off the ship at port?</font>

66
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, we can disembark 
if we fill out the proper paperwork.</font>

67
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might as well kill some time. 
I doubt this will be over quickly.</font>

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though I think anyone with a reason 
to be anxious should stay behind.</font>

69
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-All right.</font>

70
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knock it off! I said I'm not going.</font>

71
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, man. Don't be such a drag.</font>

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, Yuri!</font>

73
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should come, too.</font>

74
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's party time! Right?</font>

75
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem rather excited.</font>

76
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, duh! This is a 
military base, ain't it?</font>

77
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there something here?</font>

78
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The red-light district.</font>

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some things just don't change, 
even after a few millennia.</font>

81
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly... There's nothing more foolish 
than letting your desires rule over you.</font>

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, y'all suck.</font>

83
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon. Let's go.</font>

84
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

85
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Base 52?</font>

86
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. There's a person 
I'm looking for from there,</font>

87
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I was hoping someone here 
might be familiar with it.</font>

88
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ring any bells?</font>

89
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Base 52... 52...</font>

90
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think...</font>

91
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's from there.</font>

92
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

93
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

94
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I ask you a few questions?</font>

95
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. But not for free.</font>

96
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

97
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, I'm just messin' with ya.</font>

98
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what did you want to ask me?</font>

99
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm... There's no one named Setsu there.</font>

100
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I searched the last hundred years' 
worth of personnel records, too.</font>

101
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see... So that really is what happened.</font>

102
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What happened?</font>

103
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing. Thank you very much.</font>

104
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you can find them.</font>

105
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They must be very important to you.</font>

106
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As I thought, their whole 
existence is just gone.</i></font>

107
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The person known as Setsu was 
simply never born in this universe.</i></font>

108
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Setsu.</font>

109
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That never happened.</i></font>

110
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Or that.</i></font>

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Or that.</i></font>

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Or that.</i></font>

113
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let go of me!</font>

115
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, now. We're not gonna bite.</font>

116
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be our treat. Come on.</font>

117
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jina!</font>

118
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri!</font>

119
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Who the hell're you?</font>

120
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're under quarantine 
after arriving from Liu-An...</font>

121
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because of possible Gnosia infection.</font>

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gnosia?!</font>

123
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Let's get the hell outta here.</font>

124
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess everyone's pretty scared 
of being infected by the Gnosia.</font>

125
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

126
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, if they just used 
their common sense,</font>

127
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's pretty obvious that the military 
wouldn't have let us into the city</font>

128
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if there was any chance we were infected.</font>

129
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, your acting was very convincing.</font>

130
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I just got really good 
at lying at some point.</font>

131
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This...</font>

132
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">seems to be a navigational record 
of historical space voyages.</font>

133
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

134
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It contains about a thousand years' worth 
of records for the Allacosia star system.</font>

135
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never knew something like that existed.</font>

136
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to take a look?</font>

137
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow...</font>

138
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can see how the ships 
passed through certain areas.</font>

139
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Space traffic controllers 
need to know these things.</font>

140
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are a lot of asteroids 
in Allacosia, right?</font>

141
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised you knew that.</font>

142
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu told me.</font>

143
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu?</font>

144
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, never mind.</font>

145
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the person you 
mentioned yesterday?</font>

146
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

147
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone says it's because my 
memories are messed up, though.</font>

148
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like you to tell me about them.</font>

149
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

150
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you talk about them, 
you might feel a little better.</font>

151
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So they went to the other side...</font>

152
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

153
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think that because they went 
through the dimensional door</font>

154
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and transferred to another universe, 
now they just never existed here.</font>

155
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

156
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure this must be hard to believe.</font>

157
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't even imagine it.</font>

158
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I also can't imagine that 
you're lying about all this, Yuri.</font>

160
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jina...</font>

161
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this Setsu person is 
alive in that other world.</font>

162
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

163
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But my looping is over, 
so I have no way of confirming it.</font>

164
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ended?</font>

165
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. That's what they said 
when they went through the door.</font>

166
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to keep looping on the other side 
of this door until I'm done—</font>

167
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">until I give you the Silver Key 
in that other universe.</font>

168
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I think they'll give me 
the Key in the other universe.</font>

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

170
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

171
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not really sure, but...</font>

172
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu's already gone,</font>

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but don't they still have to give the Key 
to the you of <i>this</i> universe?</font>

174
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. I'm just rambling.</font>

175
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It probably doesn't work that way.</font>

176
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio!</font>

177
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry! I just remembered 
something I need to do.</font>

178
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Silver Key...</font>

179
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph. Taken an interest to it, have you?</font>

180
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some use the Key because 
they wish to return to the past,</font>

181
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the frightening thing about it</font>

182
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is that you can't even choose 
to end things on your own.</font>

183
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">End things?</font>

184
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

185
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This thing won't leave its host until</font>

186
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's filled with the 
information it desires.</font>

187
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The loops will continue 
until it's satisfied.</font>

188
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could end up looping for all eternity.</font>

189
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio!</font>

190
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something I need to ask you.</font>

191
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

192
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

193
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

194
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will Setsu be able 
to close the loop over there?</font>

195
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph. That's what you 
call wishful thinking.</font>

196
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be blunt. What Jina said is correct.</font>

197
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to connect cause with effect,</font>

198
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu needs to give the you 
in this universe the Silver Key.</font>

199
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

200
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm assuming that Setsu went to the other 
universe, knowing this would happen,</font>

201
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in order to save you.</font>

202
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Setsu has to keep looping 
in the other universe?</i></font>

203
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And they knew this would happen?</i></font>

204
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run.</font>

205
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chipie?</font>

206
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just run, damn it!</font>

207
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Well, if it ain't Yuri.</font>

208
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sha-ming?</font>

209
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perfect timin'.</font>

210
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was out drinkin' with Chipie 
until he ditched me, the bastard.</font>

211
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you'll do just fine.</font>

212
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Hey, where are we going?</font>

213
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heaven!</font>

214
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our new source of fundin' has arrived! 
Now keep those bottles comin'!</font>

215
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, have a drink.</font>

216
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, but...</font>

217
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, by the way, here's the current tab.</font>

218
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So pay up, if you could. Thanks.</font>

219
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Uh, I can't pay all this.</font>

220
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! I'm beggin' ya!</font>

221
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, open wide.</font>

222
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's why Chipie told me to run...</font>

223
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That bastard really told me that 
he was only interested in cats.</font>

224
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, he's annoyin'.</font>

225
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say that...</font>

226
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you gonna say the same thing?</font>

227
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No point puttin' on airs.</font>

228
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure there's at least one or 
two chicks you wanna take to bed.</font>

229
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't.</font>

230
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hah! I hate people who try to act 
like they're above it all.</font>

231
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention...</font>

232
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

233
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

234
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there is someone precious to me.</font>

235
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, ya bang 'em?</font>

236
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like that.</font>

237
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hah! So what? You're just gonna stare 
at them with your thumb up yer ass?</font>

238
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Oh, but I'm just too scared! 
What if I get hurt?" That it?</font>

239
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You got nothin' more to say?</font>

240
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess I hit the nail on the head.</font>

241
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true...</font>

242
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I could go after them, I would have!</font>

243
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's nothing I can do.</font>

244
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing...</font>

245
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's just nothing...</font>

246
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they crying?</font>

247
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How adorable.</font>

248
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

249
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there <i>really</i> nothin' you can do?</font>

250
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you're not just lookin' 
for an excuse to give up?</font>

251
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

252
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How'd the military inspection go?</font>

253
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It just finished.</font>

254
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No traces of the Gnosia were detected, 
so we're free to leave without issue.</font>

255
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness.</font>

256
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Racio?</font>

257
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio? I believe they just returned...</font>

258
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio!</font>

259
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you'd show up.</font>

260
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd you get that Silver Key?</font>

261
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my valued experimental subject.</font>

262
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to buy it.</font>

263
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just calm down for a bit.</font>

264
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

265
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to let this Key make a host out 
of you, fill it completely, open the door,</font>

266
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and go after Setsu, right?</font>

267
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the only way.</font>

268
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think you can pull it off?</font>

269
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to!</font>

270
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu is stuck over there, 
unable to close their own loop.</font>

271
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I don't, they'll keep looping forever!</font>

272
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

273
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Again, calm down.</font>

274
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think they did 
all this to begin with?</font>

275
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because...</font>

276
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that you could live.</font>

277
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you and the real Yuri 
can't exist in the same universe.</font>

278
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was why the only solution 
was for Setsu to go through the door.</font>

279
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what's going to happen 
if you go after them?</font>

280
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just going to cause 
the same problem again.</font>

281
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of Setsu's hard work</font>

282
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and your efforts filling up the 
Silver Key that opened the door</font>

283
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would be for nothing.</font>

284
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite obvious, 
if you think about it logically.</font>

285
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what should I do?</font>

286
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu is still over there, 
unable to close their loop!</font>

287
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to forget them.</font>

288
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This Setsu person doesn't 
even exist in this universe.</font>

289
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no point in thinking 
about someone who doesn't exist.</font>

290
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a universal truth.</font>

291
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's...</font>

292
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you don't like that answer, 
I have another.</font>

293
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what Setsu wanted.</font>

294
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I couldn't argue with that.</i></font>

295
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Every single thing Racio said was correct.</i></font>

296
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What Setsu wanted...</i></font>

297
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Setsu wanted me... to continue 
living in this universe.</i></font>

298
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And... they wanted to disappear from it.</i></font>

299
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Yuri...</font>

300
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Otome...</font>

301
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a lovely café.</font>

302
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

303
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Setsu like being here?</font>

304
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

305
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was I wrong?</font>

306
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you're right. 
I'm surprised you figured it out.</font>

307
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It didn't seem like your kind of place, 
so I thought that might be it.</font>

308
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you don't remember 
anything about Setsu, right?</font>

309
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'm very sorry.</font>

310
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. That's how it's supposed to be.</font>

311
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because in this universe...</font>

312
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said...</font>

313
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't remember their face, 
voice, or appearance, but...</font>

314
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whenever I hear that name, 
I feel a little twinge.</font>

315
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A twinge?</font>

316
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wight awound hwere.</font>

317
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri?!</font>

318
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it! They wouldn't 
just disappear so easily.</font>

319
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They wouldn't just cease to be.</font>

320
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if they went to another dimension... 
A whole other universe...</font>

321
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their heart...</font>

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their feelings... are stronger than that!</font>

323
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio?</font>

324
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio?</font>
