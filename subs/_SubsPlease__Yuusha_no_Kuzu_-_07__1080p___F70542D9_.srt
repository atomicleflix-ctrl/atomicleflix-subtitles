<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You...</font>

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It hurts...</font>

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it!</font>

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Again with this?!</font>

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Levy, it's him!</font>

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the strongest!</font>

7
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run!</font>

00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}SCUM OF THE BRAVE</font>

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}DEATH OF A BRAVE</font>

10
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Let me go!</font>

11
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough!</font>

12
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's not what you think! I just...</font>

13
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make this harder. Get going.</font>

14
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said <i>go</i>, damn it!</font>

15
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Of course they followed us.</i></font>

16
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They might be close still.</font>

17
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll find them.</font>

18
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That one has an ether perception</i>
<i>that lets her track targets.</i></font>

19
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That badge...</i></font>

20
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Where's that mark from?</i></font>

21
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A dragon?</i></font>

22
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's actually trying to kill me!</i></font>

23
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, let's call this off.</font>

24
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't wanna deal with
security guards, right?</font>

25
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Considering where we are.</font>

26
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You respond quickly.</font>

27
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enhancement powers, I take it?</font>

28
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'd say...</font>

29
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now the tables are turned.</font>

30
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The difference is...</font>

31
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be negotiating.</font>

32
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Seriously?</i></font>

33
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is this kid actually insane?</i></font>

34
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master!</font>

35
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your beautiful apprentice
has come to your rescue!</font>

36
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps you could look more pleased?!</font>

37
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you to run, damn it.
Where's Indo?</font>

38
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to worry!</font>

39
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She should have safely escaped by now.</font>

40
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not what I meant!</font>

41
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you guys weren't gonna listen,</font>

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the useful one could've
come back at least.</font>

43
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you should've
read my mind to figure it out!</font>

44
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, I've got a teenaged hindrance now,</i></font>

45
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and that woman is physically</i>
<i>stronger than me at the moment.</i></font>

46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I had a sword, I'd just</i>
<i>lop her hands off.</i></font>

47
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But with these toys?</i></font>

48
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe if I knew what her ether</i>
<i>perception was tracking...</i></font>

49
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's scent, Master.</font>

50
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She appears to track scents.</font>

51
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or more like, she has a remarkable
ability to distinguish smells.</font>

52
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think of a well-polished mirror...</font>

53
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, more like, the way watercolor paint
would look on damp, sandy ground.</font>

54
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jogamine.</font>

55
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work!</font>

56
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll kill you later.</font>

57
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right!</font>

58
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would be an honor!</font>

59
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems my wordplay
has yielded unexpected—</font>

60
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't say all that.</font>

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when you try to explain something,
keep it as short as possible.</font>

62
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You talk too damn much.</font>

63
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's a special occasion,</i></font>

64
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so let me show you what</i>
<i>a super move looks like.</i></font>

65
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When you've got two swords clashing,</i>
<i>and they're bound up together,</i></font>

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>pushing or pulling at the wrong</i>
<i>time can cost you your life.</i></font>

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You shift offense and defense quickly.</i></font>

68
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In other words...</i></font>

69
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's right up my alley.</i></font>

70
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-Brilliantly done, Master!</font>

71
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I busted her nose,</i>
<i>which she used to track us.</i></font>

72
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But seriously, who are these people?</i></font>

73
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Because I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>they're not security guards.</i></font>

74
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Should I kill them?</i></font>

75
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Getting rid of the bodies</i>
<i>would be a pain, but...</i></font>

76
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master!</font>

77
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I wouldn't if I were you.</font>

78
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the two of us fight,
I think one will have to die.</font>

79
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're pretty strong.</font>

80
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get that a lot.</font>

81
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what's her deal?</font>

82
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm pretty sure you're
not after me, right?</font>

83
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you two just wild dogs?</font>

84
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, sorry.</font>

85
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think your group getting the
drop on us must've irked her.</font>

86
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a proud soul.</font>

87
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess. And you?</font>

88
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hardly.</font>

89
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we both avoid further trouble?</font>

90
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to pretend
I didn't see anything.</font>

91
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you recant your actions,
then we shall forgive you!</font>

92
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But never attempt to trespass again!</font>

93
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master and I will catch you every time!</font>

94
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, thanks for the lecture.</font>

95
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think, "Master"?</font>

96
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">– Let's go.
– Yes, sir!</font>

97
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye!</font>

98
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My own master...</font>

99
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He called that move the "Draw."</font>

100
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you're bound up,
you push just for a second.</font>

101
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other person will
push back instinctively.</font>

102
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which is when you pull back,
and their stance collapses.</font>

103
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if the other person pulls back—</font>

104
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since the bind is undone,
you take that opportunity to strike.</font>

105
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's not as easy as it sounds.</font>

106
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It takes practice, and experience.</font>

107
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master!</font>

108
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I interpret your explanation as
an exclusive lesson for yours truly?</font>

109
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make me laugh, stupid.</font>

110
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell made you so goofy, anyway?</font>

111
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An E3 overdose?</font>

112
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, sir. It's...</font>

113
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the same as you.</font>

114
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My father would, from time
to time, tell me about you.</font>

115
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so moved that night
I encountered you,</font>

116
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure how to describe it.</font>

117
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're gonna wanna hit the hospital.</font>

118
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See ya.</font>

119
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At first, I was shocked by the contrast.</font>

120
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Really? This failure of a person who
looks like a petty thug?" I thought.</font>

121
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the deeper I read your thoughts...</font>

122
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang on.</font>

123
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your dad...</font>

124
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was his name?</font>

125
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Takamiya Kiyohito, sir.</font>

126
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is to say, <i>your</i> master, Master!</font>

127
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you not realize?</font>

128
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would have thought Ishino-san told you.</font>

129
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When my parents divorced,
my mother got custody,</font>

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I was only able to see
my father once a month.</font>

131
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I did see him, he would describe
how wonderful being a Brave was.</font>

132
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master said that?</font>

133
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That being a Brave is wonderful?</font>

134
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I look up to my father, Master.</font>

135
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why did <i>you</i> decide
to become a Brave?</font>

136
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seven years ago...</font>

137
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to drop out of high school

195
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was worried, considering how I left you.</font>

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to make sure you were okay.</font>

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

209

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone's strength...</font>

211
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,080

212
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,040

213
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, considering you didn't seem fazed
by that monster from the other day,</font>

214
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you freaked out

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's no other explanation.</font>

216
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. I did chicken out.</font>

217
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You probably think I'm not
cut out to be a Brave, right?</font>

218
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep.</font>

219
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a good person, so you
should quit being a Brave.</font>

220
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you know? Damn.</font>

221
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My master once told me...</font>

222
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's nothing wrong with
being afraid of an opponent.</font>

223
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The issue is controlling your
fear before it kills you.</font>

224
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only way to get used to
it is through experience.</font>

225
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People like Jogamine are
the exception, truly.</font>

226
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That girl...</font>

227
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I gotta ask...</font>

228
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell is her deal?</font>

229
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She sure doesn't seem like a mind reader!</font>

230
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm amazed you put up with her.</font>

231
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Aki apparently
doesn't read our minds.</font>

232
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She usually mentions if she uses
her power to read someone's mind.</font>

233
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When she meets someone new,
it's hard to tune them out.</font>

234
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she hears them
unintentionally at first.</font>

235
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think she's reading your mind,
either, unless she needs to.</font>

236
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen?</font>

237
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really.</font>

238
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only teamed up with
her since the exercise.</font>

239
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know her that well...</font>

240
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she seems nice.</font>

241
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You call someone "nice" when you don't
have anything nice to say about them.</font>

242
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll admit, she's definitely weird.</font>

243
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's always butting into
other people's business,</font>

244
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she shows up to help even
when she has nothing to offer.</font>

245
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the fact that she does all
this stuff out of stubbornness...</font>

246
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I kind of like that about her.
Jogamine, I mean.</font>

247
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I sure <i>don't</i>.</font>

248
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you're a good person, you tell her!</font>

249
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kind of...</font>

250
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Joe.</font>

251
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ed Cyrus isn't around.</font>

252
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you had work?</font>

253
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">– Did you botch the job already?
– Shut up.</font>

254
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know.</font>

255
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Malta of all people apparently came by.</font>

256
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like he and Ed went out.</font>

257
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think we should grab some
food while they're gone?</font>

258
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Joe?</font>

259
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Yashiro, what are you gonna do?</font>

260
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do about what?</font>

261
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw tonight's news.</font>

262
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I asked someone
who knows what's what.</font>

263
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:06,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This morning, a dippy-looking corpse was
found in a back alley over in Shin-Okubo.</font>

264
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it was...</font>

265
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll probably laugh.
When I saw the picture...</font>

266
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was stabbed all over, with the
finishing blow right across the throat.</font>

267
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should've seen the hole in his neck.</font>

268
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dude could come back as a ghost,
