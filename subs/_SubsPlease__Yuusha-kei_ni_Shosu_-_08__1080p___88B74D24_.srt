1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to support from the hero unit
and the dragoon's attack,</font>

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we were able to repel the assassins,</font>

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the Holy Knight network 
we set up was shredded,</font>

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and close to half of its members died.</font>

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A surprise attack designed to isolate 
Goddess Teoritta and our team...</font>

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The execution was flawless.</font>

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you suggesting 
there's a traitor in our midst?</font>

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't trust your allies, 
you're kind of hamstrung in a fight.</font>

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nearly all of the snipers 
I positioned were picked off.</font>

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should limit Goddess Teoritta's 
protective detail to only those we trust—</font>

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If</i> we trust anyone.</font>

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Those we trust" is 
inherently untrustworthy.</font>

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even those in this room 
should be held under suspicion.</font>

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there's no one we should 
trust <i>less</i> than a penal hero.</font>

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the very least, 
this requires investigation.</font>

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Contact the Twelfth Order 
of the Holy Knights.</font>

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They may specialize in intelligence, 
but they don't show themselves in public.</font>

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're basically hamstrung 
if we don't know who we can trust.</font>

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said it yourself.</font>

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've taken all opinions into account.</font>

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like the advisor who was brought in
 to weigh in on this problem.</font>

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think, High Priest Marlen?</font>

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good question.</font>

24
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only just arrived
from the First Capital.</font>

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The question of who can be trusted is 
of great importance. And I include myself.</font>

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But frankly, I don't know if the 
intelligence unit can act on this.</font>

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How go the prisoner 
interrogations, Patausche?</font>

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not well at all.</font>

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most of those we took alive were 
adventurers with no real information.</font>

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If only we could have 
brought in the assassins...</font>

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't take it so personally.</font>

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You place far too much responsibility 
on your own shoulders.</font>

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stewing in regret and tension 
won't improve the situation.</font>

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll remember that, Uncle.</font>

35
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As stiff as ever.</font>

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you wouldn't be 
Patausche Kivia otherwise.</font>

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Eminence.</font>

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo, quiet.</font>

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe my opinion is relevant.</font>

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I didn't, I wouldn't dream of 
interrupting a man of your high station.</font>

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assertive tone, yet conciliatory words.</font>

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Patausche, you could learn from this man.</font>

43
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes, Uncle.</font>

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well then, Hero Xylo...</font>

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's hear what you have to say.</font>

46
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir. First, we should look into 
the adventurers' middleman agency:</font>

47
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Guild.</font>

48
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lideo Sodrick.</font>

49
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he's the Adventurers Guild's
 representative, huh?</font>

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say his ancestor 
founded a private army</font>

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to take down the pirates 
plaguing Korio Bay,</font>

52
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that's how the Guild
 came into being.</font>

53
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a nice story, but...</font>

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was probably just a turf war 
between wannabe pirate crews.</font>

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever the facts, Lideo Sodrick 
is a big name in that town.</font>

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The history of the Sodrick's Shell region</font>

57
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that of the Adventurers Guild
 are one and the same.</font>

58
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo.</font>

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did things go well enough?</font>

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh? What do you mean?</font>

61
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Well, you know...</font>

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I figured they might have hit us 
with a new punishment or something.</font>

63
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it was all pretty evenhanded.</font>

64
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

65
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You weren't hoping to make a pass 
at that sniper woman, were you?</font>

67
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Certainly not. 
It's nothing like that. It's just...</font>

68
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, never mind.</font>

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, come on.</font>

70
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come help me pick 
a group for the mission.</font>

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you a few tips 
while we're at it.</font>

72
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, seriously. I don't need any tips.</font>

73
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really not about that.</font>

74
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's really not about that at all.</font>

75
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you failed.</font>

76
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The dragoon wasn't part of the plan.</font>

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The heroes were also far stronger 
than intel led us to believe.</font>

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that man there is an amateur.</font>

79
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should take him off the job
 or kill him right now.</font>

80
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you mean me?</font>

81
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I found Boojum in 
a gambling house I oversee.</font>

82
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The whole place was soaked with blood.</font>

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ten adventurers picked a fight with him, 
and he killed them all stone dead.</font>

84
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he's an amateur, 
teach him how to be a pro.</font>

85
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's just going to hold me back.</font>

86
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm requesting more money.</font>

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So claiming the enemy's too strong 
is an excuse to beg for money, huh?</font>

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. You're trying to provoke me.</font>

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big brother, she's a wild dog.</font>

90
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her lack of a master
 makes her dangerous.</font>

91
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Iri, stand down.</font>

92
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be fine.</font>

93
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiji Bau. The Adventurers Guild isn't 
like the military you were once part of.</font>

94
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you drop out, you get no reward for completion.</font>

95
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll need three times this.</font>

96
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to hire my own people.</font>

97
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Experts</i>.</font>

98
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You...</font>

99
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd also like a pay increase.</font>

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to buy another book.</font>

101
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like this writer.</font>

102
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Altoyard Comette.</font>

103
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such a brilliant poet.</font>

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brother, do you think they can do it?</font>

105
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing you need to worry about.</font>

106
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is someone out there?</font>

107
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Odd to see you up and about this early.</font>

108
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Neely kick you out of the stables?</font>

109
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

110
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neely's jealous.</font>

111
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She saw me with another dragon.</font>

112
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't even like that.</font>

113
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, c'mon. Quit needling Jayce.</font>

114
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys take any excuse 
to pick a fight with each other.</font>

115
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not true.</font>

116
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It <i>is</i> true.</font>

117
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're both simmering cauldrons 
of rage and violence.</font>

118
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish they would put you on 
different meal schedules at least.</font>

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}They're heroes.</font>

120
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The shifty-eyed one 
is Xylo Forbartz, right?</font>

121
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}They say that psycho covered 
his whole body in sacred seals.</font>

122
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Teoritta? She isn't with you?</font>

123
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's still asleep.</font>

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I also can't let her hear 
what I'm about to say.</font>

125
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, boy. You're gonna make me 
do something, aren't you?</font>

126
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

127
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it'll be something 
dangerous, won't it?</font>

128
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something too dangerous 
for Teoritta to tag along.</font>

129
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that's right. 
Glad we're on the same page.</font>

130
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, come on. Cheer up.</font>

131
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get to walk around town
 without shackles.</font>

132
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like that's a good thing.</font>

133
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear Tsav got messed up bad. 
His whole right arm got mangled.</font>

134
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. And he was lucky 
it was just the one arm.</font>

135
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what's the plan?</font>

136
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, we infiltrate 
the Adventurers Guild.</font>

137
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't Rhyno be better for that?</font>

138
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He used to be an adventurer, right?</font>

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not happening.</font>

140
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rhyno's locked up at the moment.
And anyway, he's too unpredictable.</font>

141
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about Venetim or whatever?</font>

142
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He went with His Majesty 
to the repair shop.</font>

143
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems they finally found 
a leg he could use.</font>

144
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But still...</font>

145
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Dotta won't go, I'll step in.</font>

146
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got nothing better to do.</font>

147
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You mean it?</font>

148
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then—</font>

149
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dotta. I need <i>your</i> skills.</font>

150
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

151
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better not give Dotta a hard time.</font>

152
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dotta fed his own arm to a hungry dragon.</font>

153
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's an incredible person.</font>

154
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure even I could 
make that sacrifice.</font>

155
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got an unconventional admirer.</font>

156
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's not talk about it.</font>

157
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? What's the whole story?</font>

158
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How were you planning to infiltrate it?</font>

159
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, about that...</font>

160
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there a problem?</font>

161
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you about to say 
I look like a man again?</font>

162
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it suits you extremely well.</font>

163
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the very image 
of a young noblewoman.</font>

164
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kind with no shortage of suitors.</font>

165
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C-Cease your flattery.</font>

166
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not expect to get on my good side
 by paying me compliments.</font>

167
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to hear it.</font>

168
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we need to figure out 
what we're hiring them for.</font>

169
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the Adventurers Guild, 
faerie hunting seems the best option.</font>

170
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the military's job, isn't it?</font>

171
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about wiping out some bandits?</font>

172
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tone down the scale 
of the violence a bit.</font>

173
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bandit-hunting might work 
if we were out in the sticks,</font>

174
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but this is Ioff City.</font>

175
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of job do you recommend, then?</font>

176
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's say...</font>

177
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the wife of a noble.</font>

178
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're her paramour.</font>

179
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

180
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh?</font>

181
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're plotting to get
 her husband killed.</font>

182
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any nobles out there you want dead?</font>

183
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The defendant: Dotta Luzulas.</font>

184
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have over a thousand 
criminal acts on your record.</font>

185
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you have been brought before us
 today to address just one:</font>

186
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">escaping the castle dungeon
in which you were confined,</font>

187
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and stealing that dragon in the process.</font>

188
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait a minute.</font>

189
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about him?
 Isn't he part of my crime?</font>

191
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To whom do you refer?</font>

192
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The crown prince!</font>

193
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The crown prince?</font>

194
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What's he talking about?</font>

195
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does His Highness 
have to do with this?</font>

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That little boy asked me to save him.</font>

197
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true.</font>

198
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said he'd been locked up in
 the castle. That he'd run away.</font>

199
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought we could use 
the dragon to escape—</font>

200
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cease these lies at once.</font>

201
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The assertion that the crown prince
 spoke to you is false.</font>

202
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So is the assertion that 
he attempted to escape the castle.</font>

203
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That <i>can't</i> be true.</font>

204
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I ran into him during my jailbreak.</font>

205
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was definitely the First Prince 
of the Federated Kingdom.</font>

206
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was about ten years old, 
and scared out of his wits.</font>

207
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said the royal family 
was acting strange.</font>

208
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The king had been out of sorts for 
a long time. I think the chancellor—</font>

209
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be silent, Dotta Luzulas.</font>

210
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, there's something going on
 with the royal family!</font>

211
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why else would the crown prince 
come to someone like <i>me</i> for help?</font>

212
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just some two-bit 
scumbag thief l-like me...</font>

213
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be silent.</font>

214
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even I have a conscience, you know?</font>

215
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I don't show it to everyone...</font>

216
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when I see someone weaker than me,
 like the prince was then...</font>

217
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to help them, like anyone would.</font>

218
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This is all wrong.</font>

219
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you won't let me help him, 
someone else has to.</font>

220
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please save that boy!</font>

221
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't continue the trial like this.</font>

222
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Confessor, I believe death 
would be a reasonable sentence.</font>

223
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I believe you're right.</font>

224
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But a more serious sentence 
has already been approved for him.</font>

225
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By whom?</font>

226
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was suggested by 
the Central Noble Alliance.</font>

227
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The matter is final.</font>

228
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong with you?
 I'll steal him next time for sure.</font>

229
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dotta Luzulas.</font>

230
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are being sentenced
 to serve as a hero.</font>

231
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a pain in the butt, 
but I've gotta do it, huh?</font>

232
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, we've got the good stuff here.</font>

233
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want a drag?</font>

234
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tch. They're ignoring us.</font>

235
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Swine.</font>

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is quite unpleasant.</font>

237
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Dragon's Breath."</font>

238
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Its use has spread a lot
 because of Jayce.</font>

239
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're openly breaking the law.</font>

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been wondering. 
Why did you join the military?</font>

241
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

242
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're from a Temple family 
with a large domain.</font>

243
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why put your neck on the line?</font>

244
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

245
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My mother and father are priests.</font>

246
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They carried out important duties
 for the Temple,</font>

247
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and earned various benefits in return.</font>

248
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Benefits, huh?</font>

249
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Noble priests," then, 
cashing in on their influence and faith?</font>

250
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. And not always in 
aboveboard ways like donations.</font>

251
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hated that about my parents.</font>

252
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I joined the military, 
hoping to make my own way.</font>

253
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

254
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first sword I ever got. For training.</font>

255
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My uncle bought it for me.</font>

256
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to secure my own future
 with my own talents.</font>

257
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was my uncle who supported me in that.</font>

258
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Xylo.</font>

259
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That f-fiancée of yours—</font>

260
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo. I checked out the Guild.</font>

261
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was fast. Nice work.</font>

262
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Almost too fast, I must say.</font>

263
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Security there seems pretty tight.</font>

264
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About twenty guards.</font>

265
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Less than I'd expect.</font>

266
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I saw a bunch of weird kids
 scattered around.</font>

267
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think they're like little assassins.</font>

268
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Children? That's horrible.</font>

269
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard they take in orphans and raise them
 to ensure they have loyal soldiers.</font>

270
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway!</font>

271
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm supposed to abscond with the 
representative while you're in there, yes?</font>

272
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that stealing people has 
ever gone particularly well for me.</font>

273
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just do it.</font>

274
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kivia, you're the daughter of 
a wealthy noble. I'm your secret lover.</font>

275
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's right. Leave it to me!</font>

276
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hurt.</font>

277
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It appears to be the penal hero,
 Xylo Forbartz.</font>

278
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The woman with him 
is clearly a Holy Knight.</font>

279
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo Forbartz. That's very bad.</font>

280
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But depending on the circumstances,
if we could take him in alive...</font>

281
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll try to find a chance.</font>

282
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Contact Shiji Bau and the others.</font>

283
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wake up Duhrsami too, just in case.</font>

284
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't let them leave here alive.</font>

285
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

286
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is all for my family.</font>

287
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's someone I want killed.</font>

288
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to request someone 
with a lot of experience.</font>

289
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And who exactly are you?</font>

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Madleen. I'd prefer
 to keep my family name secret.</font>

291
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have a reference?</font>

292
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to take the job or not?</font>

293
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well?</font>

294
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Madleen, we don't take jobs 
from just anyone who walks in the door.</font>

295
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, miss. 
The lady's quite sheltered.</font>

296
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's not used to places like this.</font>

297
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have a reference, 
but we're truly desperate.</font>

298
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If nothing else, we'd like to get out 
of the city without being traced.</font>

299
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So just hypothetically... 
Who do you want killed?</font>

300
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A nobleman.</font>

301
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You familiar with the Hystead family,
 the bridge-keepers of Ginai?</font>

302
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

303
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're having a bit of trouble with the 
third son of one of their branch families.</font>

304
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was married into the Hystead family, 
but this man and I... well...</font>

305
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We pledged ourselves to each other 
beneath a sacred hagra tree.</font>

306
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish to have my husband killed 
so that I can be with this man.</font>

307
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">E-Even if we have to run away together!</font>

308
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">J-Just hold on one second.</font>

309
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}This seems dangerous.</font>

310
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think they suspect us.</font>

311
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We should report it to the master.</font>

312
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I think you're right there.</font>

313
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Is she really a noblewoman?</font>

314
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't good. What do we do?</font>

315
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Good question.</font>

316
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say...</font>

317
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's raise hell.</font>

318
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

319
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll start up some trouble 
and cause confusion.</font>

320
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like setting fire to rob the place.</font>

321
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although it's Lideo Sodrick 
we're here to steal.</font>

322
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's absurdly reckless.</font>

323
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, we're doing it.</font>

324
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll start with them—</font>

325
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You requested someone skilled, correct?</font>

326
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You—</font>

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Renzari?</font>

328
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A noble lady and her paramour. Correct?</font>

329
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could we use one of the rooms upstairs?</font>

330
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're in an awful state, Xylo.</font>

331
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the reaction I expected.</font>

332
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your stupidity is immeasurable.</font>

333
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I hadn't stepped in, you would 
have undoubtedly been arrested.</font>

334
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wrong. We were just 
about to cause a commotion.</font>

335
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, and in the meantime, our ally was to
sneak in and secure the evidence we need.</font>

336
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you with the Holy Knights?</font>

337
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Patausche Kivia, captain of the 
Thirteenth Order of the Holy Knights.</font>

338
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd prefer it if you didn't indulge 
my fiancé so much.</font>

339
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's awkward, uneducated, 
boorish, and thoughtless.</font>

340
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need an outsider
 encouraging him.</font>

341
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Outsider? You're the one 
who's an outsider to this plan.</font>

342
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am his fiancée. We must face 
all of our trials together.</font>

343
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's no excuse!</font>

344
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had a feeling your personalities would 
clash, but this is worse than I thought.</font>

345
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You thought our personalities...</font>

346
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...would clash?</font>

347
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that the conclusion 
you always seem to come to?</font>

348
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you no brain in your head?</font>

349
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it goes far beyond that.</font>

350
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His ability to evaluate others 
is the poorest I've seen.</font>

351
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree. His observational skills 
are on the level of a susubana mole.</font>

352
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say your average tree 
is smarter, in fact.</font>

353
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you please not bond
 over insulting me?</font>

354
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in a serious situation here.</font>

355
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you even doing here?</font>

356
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've disguised myself as 
an adventurer to investigate.</font>

357
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was on the verge of making 
contact with Lideo Sodrick.</font>

358
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry we got in your way.</font>

359
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then again, we can always—</font>

360
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me, sir, ma'am.</font>

361
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guildmaster would like to speak
 with you about your request.</font>

362
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frenci. Feel free to back out now.</font>

363
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely you jest.</font>

364
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The very suggestion disgusts me.</font>

365
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it'd be easier
to make a commotion.</font>

366
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How appallingly ill-mannered.</font>

367
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need disciplining.</font>

368
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

369
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There they are!</font>

370
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill them!</font>

371
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Don't let them leave here alive!</font>

372
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm seeing a lot of potential chaos here.</font>

373
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This wasn't how I foresaw 
things going, but...</font>

374
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My goodness. You really are doing this.</font>

375
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. We can smoke out Lideo Sodrick,</font>

376
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and clean up the town while we're at it.</font>

377
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What in the world?</font>

378
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's call it our civic duty.</font>

379
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is terrible.</font>

380
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,330
