<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've seen all the cafés that 
have sprung up on the street</font>

130
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in front of the house, haven't you?</font>

131
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because so many girls gather there</font>

132
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hoping to see the prince, or if they're 
very lucky, to catch his eye.</font>

133
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,730

135
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that there is no prince anywhere 
who's kinder than our master.</font>

136
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You love him yourself, don't you, Zoey?</font>

137
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do?</font>

138
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, no...</font>

139
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar. You've even started 
studying magic lately,</font>

140
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">all for the master.</font>

141
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You misunderstand!</font>

142
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want to be useful to him!</font>

143
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy just to be able to serve him.</font>

144
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'll excuse me.</font>

145
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to admire her.</font>

146
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's just so cute!</font>

147
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The knight selection exam is complete.</font>

148
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here is the report on this 
year's knight selection exam.</font>

149
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

150
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to your screening method,</font>

151
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">all of this year's new 
knights are excellent.</font>

152
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The knights have expressed 
their gratitude.</font>

153
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell them that I'm grateful for 
their help in running it as well.</font>

154
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You honor us.</font>

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shirley, see our guest out.</font>

156
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At once.</font>

157
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be on my way, then.</font>

158
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for taking the 
trouble to pay us a visit.</font>

159
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're both knights.</font>

160
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such formality is unnecessary.</font>

161
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I beg your pardon!</font>

162
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

163
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He sent you to see off this lowly 
knight as part of your training.</font>

164
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Highness did this for me?</font>

165
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As your senior, let me give 
you a word of advice.</font>

166
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't go wrong if you stick with him.</font>

167
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd best work hard.</font>

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will.</font>

169
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Every time I spin around, 
the cold wind blows</i></font>

170
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}In the cold, the folds of my 
heart tremble and they cry</i></font>

171
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}My dearest love, if there's an 
answer, I will find it on my own</i></font>

172
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for inviting me here.</font>

173
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me to congratulate you on the 
success of the knight selection exam.</font>

174
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Please fill this night, even with a lie</i></font>

175
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:00,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Because I ended up meeting 
you, my heart is singing now</i></font>

176
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, but this party is to 
show my thanks to you two.</font>

177
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't waste all your time here. 
Go and enjoy yourselves.</font>

178
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

179
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also...</font>

180
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}It sings of you, reaching only you</i></font>

181
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All here are merchants with deep ties
to the Thirteenth Prince's house.</font>

182
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understand?</font>

183
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I will go and cultivate 
some friendships.</font>

184
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:16,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Even in the next life... 
I want to meet you</i></font>

185
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

186
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

187
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... I wasn't sure if 
I should pass this along,</font>

188
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but this is addressed to you.</font>

189
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing written on it.</font>

190
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guard at the door said the 
person who delivered it ran away.</font>

191
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may contain classified information, 
so I brought it just in case.</font>

192
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was the right decision.</font>

193
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master!</font>

194
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's dangerous! Allow me to...</font>

195
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right.</font>

196
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all?</font>

197
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems there's some unsettling movement 
among the remnants of the Almerian rebels.</font>

198
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They still haven't given up?</font>

199
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

200
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoever delivered this has gone 
back to investigate undercover.</font>

201
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

202
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the soldier from back then.</font>

203
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The same one</font>

204
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who informed me of the 
rebellion not long ago.</font>

205
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that you mention it...</font>

206
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That man did seem to 
admire you a great deal.</font>

207
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

208
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He found out later that the master had 
already learned of the rebellion,</font>

209
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but had accepted his warning 
without mentioning so.</font>

210
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he's doing this to repay the debt?</font>

211
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, Your Highness!</font>

212
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, this is bad.</font>

213
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Playing pretend-spy when you've 
had no training is too dangerous.</font>

214
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he's exposed, he'll be killed.</font>

215
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no...</font>

216
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My brother Henry should 
still be near there.</font>

217
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll send a message asking him 
to stop this. Get it ready.</font>

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Of course!</font>

219
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did it go?</font>

220
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I expected, he was 
exposed and then tortured.</font>

221
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He should have just talked, but he 
refused, so they showed no mercy.</font>

222
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My brother's unit got him out, 
but he's still unconscious.</font>

223
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my fault.</font>

224
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! There's nothing you could have done!</font>

225
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, if I'd realized it sooner, 
I could have stopped this.</font>

226
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I had put the emperor's "information

227
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zoey.</font>

228
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

229
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Send Almeria this message:</font>

230
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I will spare no expense. 
Just don't let that man die.</font>

231
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever he needs, be it money 
or a doctor, tell me."</font>

232
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, understood.</font>

233
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A single piece of information</i></font>

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>is not worth the sacrifice 
of such a deeply loyal man.</i></font>

235
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So many things I've never seen before...</font>

236
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No distractions.
You're on the job.</font>

237
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right!</font>

238
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you here to buy something?</font>

239
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

240
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To thank my brother Henry for 
suppressing the rebellion,</font>

241
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and for his letter.</font>

242
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I see.</font>

243
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I received a
shipment I'm sure you'll appreciate.</font>

244
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

245
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

246
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't feel the same as the others.</font>

247
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sharp as always, Your Highness!</font>

248
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You figured it out with 
one look, did you?</font>

249
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this... glass?</font>

250
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can make things like 
this out of glass?</font>

251
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was left behind by the uncommonly 
skilled artisan, Lindsey.</font>

252
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,990

253
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">only two goddess statues

254
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, I'll take it.</font>

255
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is 10,000 enough?</font>

256
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More than enough.</font>

257

269
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

270
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, rats. Only two in existence,

273

274
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,950

275
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,840

278
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second goddess statue was 
found, but it was broken.</font>

279
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spread that rumor.
Just around Cobalt Street is fine.</font>

280
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,900

the value of my goddess statue.</font>

the fastest wins.</font>

282
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may be disrespectful to Lindsey, but if 
it makes yours more valuable, it's fine.</font>

287
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be choosing a different gift.</font>

288
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,970

290
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, just that it's been nothing but 
surprises since I started serving you.</font>

291
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,310

292
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,200

your reasoning,</font>

293
