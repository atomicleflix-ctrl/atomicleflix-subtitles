3
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, which do you 
think would be better?</font>

4
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What difference does it make?</font>

5
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, can you do my hair 
before you go out?</font>

6
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stop.</font>

7
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll apologize, okay? 
Just don't braid out of anger.</font>

8
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're that desperate for attention, 
let's go on a date tomorrow.</font>

9
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we go?</font>

10
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

11
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not wearing your usual clothes.</font>

12
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that?</font>

13
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you say this was a date?</font>

14
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

15
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so surprised!</font>

16
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please!</font>

17
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh? Has Fern always been this cute?</i></font>

18
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Anyway, let's go.</font>

19
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark, your movements 
seem quite forced today.</font>

20
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, they're not.</font>

21
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

22
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, where are we going?</font>

23
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a marketplace. 
Let's go check it out.</font>

24
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, Ms. Frieren 
visited it several times.</font>

25
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. She said sometimes markets in 
big cities have unusual magical items.</font>

26
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow. Amazing.</font>

27
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's why there was a mountain 
of odd magical items at the inn.</font>

28
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sheesh.</font>

29
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can picture that disaster.</font>

30
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other day, she even fell asleep 
under a pile of magical items.</font>

31
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

32
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd be kind of scary at that point.</font>

33
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was.</font>

34
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think Frieren is visiting 
the hot springs again today?</font>

35
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely she's tired of it by now.</font>

36
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. She's been going 
every day recently.</font>

37
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And today, she didn't tie her hair up.</font>

38
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So good.</font>

39
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've gone with a cute 
hairstyle today, miss.</font>

40
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We always end up talking 
about Ms. Frieren.</font>

41
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like there's 
anything else to discuss.</font>

42
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look! I'll give you a discount!</font>

43
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to get something to eat?</font>

44
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not yet.</font>

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

46
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look.</font>

47
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently couples get a discount.</font>

48
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being on a date has its benefits.</font>

49
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're rather blunt, aren't you?</font>

50
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, all this stuff is pretty ordinary.</font>

51
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be surprised if they 
were all magical items.</font>

52
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have a point.</font>

53
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we're in a city, let's check 
out some other places, too.</font>

54
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is cute!</font>

55
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, nice.</font>

56
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could I get this, miss?</font>

57
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure thing.</font>

58
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

59
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You're a couple of lovebirds, huh?</font>

60
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be hungry by now, right?</font>

61
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There were some stalls selling 
tasty-looking food over there.</font>

62
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

63
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These look so good.</font>

64
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are tables over there.</font>

65
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

66
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa.</font>

67
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

68
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

69
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does seem hard to walk in those shoes.</font>

70
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are statues of 
Mr. Himmel in every city.</font>

71
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His pose in this city 
was pretty handsome, too.</font>

72
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was.</font>

73
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to Frieren, there are 
over a hundred different poses.</font>

74
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They made a few too many, didn't they?</font>

75
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously.</font>

76
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ended up talking about 
Ms. Frieren again.</font>

77
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, this is a nice, quiet place.</font>

78
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The view is pretty, too.</font>

79
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

80
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern, did you not have fun today?</font>

81
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say that.</font>

82
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't smiled once.</font>

83
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... I did like all 
the places we visited,</font>

84
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but for some reason...</font>

85
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it didn't feel like you.</font>

86
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was looking forward to our date, too.</font>

87
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Fern.</font>

88
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I actually had Frieren 
choose those places.</font>

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you do that?</font>

90
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I really wanted you to enjoy it.</font>

91
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've never been on a date before, 
so I wanted it to be special.</font>

92
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

93
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True, I was slightly disappointed 
by today, but...</font>

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm also very happy.</font>

95
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really racked your brain for me.</font>

96
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern...</font>

97
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is such a peaceful, quiet moment.</font>

98
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't that cloud look familiar?</font>

99
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's one of the pork buns we ate earlier.</font>

100
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was thinking the same thing!</font>

101
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's strange.</font>

102
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was a war orphan, I never 
thought I'd get to relax like this.</font>

103
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

104
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have Mr. Heiter to thank for that.</font>

105
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I have my master to thank.</font>

106
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't become a strong 
warrior if you're picky.</font>

107
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Master.</font>

108
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

109
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you take me in?</font>

110
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because it's what Himmel 
the Hero would've done.</font>

111
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to be in a good mood.</font>

112
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something good happen?</font>

113
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really.</font>

114
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it wasn't here either.</font>

115
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm stumped.</font>

116
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We searched everywhere 
the shopkeeper could think of.</font>

117
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel, why are you smiling?</font>

118
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in a good mood 
because today was a good day.</font>

119
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All we did was walk around 
looking for a lost cat.</font>

120
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, but I had fun going out with you.</font>

121
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though we never found the cat?</font>

122
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if things don't go as you'd hoped, 
you can still enjoy the process.</font>

123
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That alone is enough to put 
someone in a good mood.</font>

124
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh.</font>

125
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

126
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's give it another shot before 
Heiter and Eisen beat us to it.</font>

127
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There it is, Himmel.</font>

128
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must be it. Let's catch it!</font>

129
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your hair's braided again.</font>

130
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These are the braids I get 
when Fern's in a good mood.</font>

131
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't tell the difference.</font>

132
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Don't I look good?</font>

133
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really can't tell the difference.</font>

134
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,980

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should be able to see it soon.</font>

138
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the Northern Plateau checkpoint?</font>

139
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so imposing.</font>

140
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because what's beyond it 
is just that dangerous.</font>

141
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We probably won't have decent 
access to supplies for a while,</font>

142
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so let's get everything we need.</font>

143
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That suitcase fits more 
than it looks like it would.</font>

144
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Convenient, right?</font>

145
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're Fern, a first-class mage.</font>

146
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care.</font>

147
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess Fern's pretty impressive.</font>

148
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First-class mages are 
the greatest of all mages.</font>

149
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is the Northern Plateau.</font>

150
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems pretty normal, considering 
how dangerous everyone said it was.</font>

151
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you being serious, Mr. Stark?</font>

152
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

153
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're surrounded.</font>

154
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look sharp.</font>

155
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just the beginning.</font>

156
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a village.</font>

157
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I was going to die.</font>

158
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did have to stay alert 
for three days and nights.</font>

159
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope we can rest here.</font>

160
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine.</font>

161
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a cabin nobody's using.</font>

162
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feel free to use it.</font>

163
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

164
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate to ask, but in exchange...</font>

165
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A powerful monster started frequenting 
the main road past here.</font>

166
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The local knights are 
powerless against it.</font>

167
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Traveling merchants can 
no longer pass this way.</font>

168
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you can see, 
adventurers rarely visit this land.</font>

169
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you please slay 
that monster for us?</font>

170
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. We're going north anyway.</font>

171
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll slay it on our way.</font>

172
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're okay with that, right?</font>

173
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

174
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure...</font>

175
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's just a three-day trip south</font>

176
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">along the main road 
to leave the Northern Plateau.</font>

177
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need for you to live 
in this dangerous place, is there?</font>

178
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This area is certainly dangerous, 
even by the northern lands' standards.</font>

179
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we were born and raised here.</font>

180
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The land is full of our 
memories of our families.</font>

181
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who could abandon their home?</font>

182
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

183
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're counting on you.</font>

184
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be the monster.</font>

185
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't let your guard down.</font>

186
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't get a clear shot.</i></font>

187
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's different from the others.</font>

188
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This seems like a formidable foe.</font>

189
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The methods we've been using 
won't work against it.</font>

190
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It certainly seems that way.</font>

191
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

192
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it noticed me.</font>

193
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, lock it down.</font>

194
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

195
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's tough, but so am I!</font>

196
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't let it beat me!</font>

197
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren!</font>

198
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That thing was pretty strong.</font>

199
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've still only just entered 
the Northern Plateau.</font>

200
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going forward, we'll face 
loads of monsters that strong.</font>

201
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean things like that 
are all over the place?</font>

202
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That will be difficult.</font>

203
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Frieren.</font>

204
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe we should've traveled 
by sea after all.</font>

205
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it'd be worth the price.</font>

206
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't expecting to find 
such a powerful monster here.</font>

207
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I was going to die.</font>

208
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's going to be this dangerous, we 
should have sailed around the whole area.</font>

209
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why we came this way.</font>

210
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Many people live on the Northern Plateau.</font>

211
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I became a hero because 
I wanted to protect my homeland.</font>

212
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I want to protect 
other people's homes, too.</font>

213
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, many people call 
the Northern Plateau home.</font>

214
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

215
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do our best.</font>

216
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire yourselves up for the road ahead.</font>

217
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Ms. Frieren.</font>

218
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We made it through that fight 
thanks to Stark's last-ditch effort,</font>

219
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we'll have to focus more 
on teamwork going forward.</font>

220
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

221
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Stark, 
why are you still sitting?</font>

222
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sitting.</font>

223
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My legs gave out.</font>

224
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pathetic.</font>

225
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't help it!</font>

226
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought that crazy spell 
was going to kill me!</font>
