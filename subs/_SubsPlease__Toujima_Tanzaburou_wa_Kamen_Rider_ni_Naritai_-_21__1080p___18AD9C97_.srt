00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does he think he's doing?</font>

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's hilarious!</font>

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Swing Arm!</font>

00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never thought Shocker would be

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What now, Mitsuba?</font>

11
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got an idea!</font>

12
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring it on, then.</font>

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's...</font>

19
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">.44 Magnum!</font>

20
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It worked!</font>

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it, Master!</font>

22
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

23
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Is it morning already?</font>

24
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I caught a female combatant!</font>

25
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who in the world is this?!</font>

26
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's she doing here?!</font>

27
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I beat her on my own!</font>

28
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't answer who she is!</font>

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were there any other Shocker
 members with her?!</font>

30
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Shocker?!</font>

31
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is Shocker doing here?!</font>

32
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw your match yesterday!</font>

33
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was brutal, Miou-san!</font>

34
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

35
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another one-round KO! 
You've been undefeated since your debut!</font>

36
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're seriously the strongest!</font>

37
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, the other girl was just too weak.</font>

38
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really looking forward 
to your next match!</font>

39
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you're a pro wrestler, right?</font>

40
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, what was your name again?</font>

41
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think she's Thunder Raiko.</font>

42
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right, Raiko-san!</font>

43
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you on your way home from a match?</font>

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hope your trip back isn't too long.</font>

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The name's Miou, and I'm 
a mixed martial artist.</font>

46
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,330

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanna go? Right now?</font>

53
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I'm ready to go. Let's do it.</font>

54
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Easy there. I don't think this 
is the right time or place.</font>

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why? You chicken?</font>

56
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>
