1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yaga, what is that thing?</font>

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is possible to have 
man-made cursed corpses</font>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">act more autonomously than 
other forms of manipulation.</font>

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they're always powered by</font>

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">consuming cursed energy 
from the sorcerer.</font>

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet that thing is sustaining 
itself on its own cursed energy.</font>

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The higher-ups are currently trying 
to designate you as a special-grade</font>

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and officially sentence you 
to indefinite imprisonment.</font>

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because if you can intentionally 
create that thing,</font>

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you could easily have your own army.</font>

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Answer me, Yaga.</font>

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you truly not know how 
that thing was made?</font>

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Correct.</font>

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Masamichi.</font>

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone's worried about you.</font>

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say you seem down.</font>

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I told them all this!</font>

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're feeling down, 
we just have to cheer you up!</font>

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That so?</font>

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a genius, aren't I?</font>

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Takeru, I'm sorry, but I won't be 
able to come home for a while.</font>

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please let the others know, too.</font>

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leaving for work again?</font>

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It'll be a long trip.</font>

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry.</font>

28
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This forest is protected by Tengen-sama.</font>

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your mother will come see you again, too.</font>

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be all right without me.</font>

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Masamichi.</font>

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be lonely without you, Masamichi.</font>

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure, Kusakabe?</font>

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't go telling anyone I helped you.</font>

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were captured to lure Yaga-san out.</font>

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I owe that man a favor.</font>

37
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on, get!</font>

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're really sure about this?</font>

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This thing is not your nephew.</font>

40
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just something with 
your nephew's information.</font>

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're trying to tell me 
I can't live in the present</font>

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if I stay hung up on the 
dead forever, right?</font>

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still...</font>

44
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My little sister can no longer
live without Takeru.</font>

45
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Masamichi, that lady's 
my mother, isn't she?</font>

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Good job recognizing her.</font>

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had a feeling it was her.</font>

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a genius, aren't I?</font>

49
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Takeru!</font>

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Takeru!</font>

51
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, but...</font>

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't let the existence of your fully 
autonomous cursed corpses become known.</font>

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he can't live with her.</font>

55
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you apologizing?</font>

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks a lot.</font>

58
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean it.</font>

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

60
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where do you think you're going without 
any cursed corpses, Principal Yaga?</font>

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To see my son.</font>

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you've been sentenced to death,</font>

63
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">allow me to tell you the 
one way to save your life.</font>

64
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Disclose how you create those fully 
autonomous man-made cursed corpses!</font>

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all sure grew bold the 
moment Satoru was gone.</font>

66
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Principal.</font>

67
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll handle the rest, so you may leave.</font>

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

69
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You use the body's information to 
reproduce the soul's information.</font>

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you place that soul information 
in the cursed corpse's core.</font>

71
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not enough, though.</font>

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to place cores housing 
three highly compatible souls</font>

73
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">into a single cursed corpse,</font>

74
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and make those souls observe 
each other at all times.</font>

75
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doing that</font>

76
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">finally allows the souls to stabilize 
so self-awareness can take root.</font>

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roughly three months after that's born,</font>

78
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it will begin supplying 
its own cursed energy.</font>

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?!</font>

80
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why share that now?!</font>

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why wouldn't you reveal that sooner?!</font>

82
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you try to live longer?!</font>

83
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because...</font>

84
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's a curse, Principal Gakuganji.</font>

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A curse from me to you.</font>

86
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Masamichi!</font>

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you fight?</font>

88
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you not hate me?</font>

89
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pandas aren't bound by things like that.</font>

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, you were never on 
bad terms with Masamichi.</font>

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,050

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,050

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're on Jujutsu High's side now?</font>

114
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,890

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do not talk about the fight club.</font>

129
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now answer me. Who told you?</font>

130
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll get your beating after that.</font>

131
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know his name.</font>

132
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I killed him.</font>

133
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was about a month ago.</font>

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was some scumbag who was all talk.</font>

135
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kondo disappeared about a month ago.</font>

136
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll fill his slot for you.</font>

137
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or would you rather I lay you 
out in front of the bookie?</font>

138
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, yeah. He'd be wary if we 
suddenly asked to see him.</i></font>

139
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I guess we shouldn't know 
his name's Hakari, either.</i></font>

140
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yes.</font>

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No, there's no proof.</font>

142
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Time to zip the lips.</i></font>

143
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Are you sure?</font>

144
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough.</font>

145
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The boss has given you the go-ahead.</font>

146
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll pit you against 
today's seeded fighter.</font>

147
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

148
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's the one fighting.</font>

149
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's good for us.</i></font>

150
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Itadori's better suited to the fighting.</i></font>

151
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No go. I'll fight.</font>

152
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boss said he doesn't like you.</font>

153
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}<font size="20">Boss</font></font>

154
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't like it, the deal's off.</font>

155
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. We'll take it, then.</font>

156
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushiguro, that was risky.</font>

157
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your bluffs went too far.</font>

158
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not actually true.</font>

159
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If curse users are participating too, 
that means there must be decent turnover.</font>

160
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly...</font>

161
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, they're here.</font>

162
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he was watching us 
through security cameras,</font>

163
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's a high chance 
Hakari-senpai is in here.</font>

164
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itadori, you snoop around 
from the inside.</font>

165
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll snoop around that parking 
lot in the meantime.</font>

166
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe.</font>

167
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe?</font>

168
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's probably leaving me 
to my own devices.</font>

169
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he learns we're infiltrating his club,</font>

170
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll lose his trust and our opportunity 
to make contact with Hakari-san.</font>

171
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, we'll just resort to 
force if that happens.</font>

172
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's really our last resort.</font>

173
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're only here to ask Hakari-san 
for his cooperation.</font>

174
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to avoid anything that'll 
affect our future relations.</font>

175
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be honest, I don't think I 
should be doing anything tonight.</font>

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I don't want to waste the time 
we have until Tsumiki is required</font>

177
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to declare her participation 
in the Culling Game.</font>

178
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now...</font>

179
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's 5 PM on the 10th.</font>

180
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So nine days until the deadline, huh?</font>

181
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It took longer to get 
here than we thought.</font>

182
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I'll be trying to 
look for Hakari-san tonight,</font>

183
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if it looks risky, I'll pull out.</font>

184
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I say "maybe."</font>

185
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

186
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are only two rules.</font>

187
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No running away, 
and no using cursed techniques.</font>

188
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How come?</font>

189
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind if they're 
using cursed techniques.</font>

190
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because most of the spectators 
are non-sorcerers,</font>

191
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">those who can't see them.</font>

192
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A fight people can't see 
won't excite them.</font>

193
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the "no running" rule?</font>

194
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It means you fight where 
the spectators can see you.</font>

195
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all about the spectators, huh?</font>

196
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

197
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a business.</font>

198
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the boss like?</font>

199
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You curious?</font>

200
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yeah.</font>

201
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll know if you meet him.</font>

202
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I meet him?</font>

203
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are two kinds of matches.</font>

204
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Real beat-downs, like in today's 
tournament, and fixed bouts.</font>

205
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The boss writes the script for those.</font>

206
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He might call for you if you 
manage to shine out there.</font>

207
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, I just need 
to put on a good show.</font>

208
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes things simple.</font>

209
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's your opponent.</font>

210
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was blown away the first 
time I saw him, too.</font>

211
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

212
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really all about 
drawing in the crowd.</font>

213
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, we're getting started again tonight!</font>

214
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time for the 
Gachinko Fight Club Tournament!</font>

215
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commentary will be provided by me, 
your very own John☆Bobby!</font>

216
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me to introduce tonight's 
exciting match-up!</font>

217
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're joined by a sudden upstart!</font>

218
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will he rise up or burn out?!</font>

219
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the Dangerous Fireball Kid, 
Yuji Itadori!</font>

220
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He stands like a panda, sits like 
a panda, and walks like a panda!</font>

221
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Panda!</font>

225

226
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get ready to rumble!</font>

227
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,530

228
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong, Kin-chan?</font>

229
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luck is meant to be tested, you know.</font>

230
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's boring to gamble when you 
know who'll win from the start.</font>

231
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There aren't many stray sorcerers 
who are tough enough to beat Panda.</font>

232
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Whoa!</font>

234
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,300

235

264
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,600

265
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,260

273
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's so dumb. Cut it out.</font>

274
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Got it. And what about the other brat?</i></font>

275
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Continue to be vigilant.</font>

276
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll send Kirara for 
extra security later.</font>

277
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

278
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm feeling a nice buzz now.</font>

279
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:03,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't felt this alive since 
my ex maxed out my credit cards.</font>

280
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit bringing up your ex.</font>

283
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

284
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds like Itadori's going 
to be able to contact Hakari.</font>

285
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why haven't you been able to 
see him yet, Panda-senpai?</font>

286
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I do know where he is.</font>

287
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the monitor room on the roof.</font>

288
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can't get close.</font>

289
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't get close?</font>

290
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even when I approach the door, 
I can't close the distance.</font>

291
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sensation feels similar 
to Satoru's technique.</font>

292
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's probably due to Kirara's technique.</font>

293
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kirara?</font>

294
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the other third-year was a guy, right?</font>

295
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

296
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So does that phenomenon only occur 
when Kirara-san's in the monitor room?</font>

297
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

298
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I focused on being a circus panda instead 
of pushing too far and making them run off.</font>

299
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you two showed up.</font>

300
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think Itadori will 
succeed in persuading him?</font>

301
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be tough, 
but I think it's just a matter of time.</font>

302
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itadori's bright, charming personality 
is a good match for Hakari.</font>

303
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he sucks at lying, doesn't he?</font>

304
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He doesn't just suck at it.</font>

305
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He struggles to even see 
lying as an option.</font>

306
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So once Itadori enters 
the monitor room,</font>

307
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take control of the 
place quickly and quietly</font>

308
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I can buy time for the 
two of them to talk.</font>

309
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's not...</font>

310
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be fine.</font>

311
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll just put them to sleep.</font>

312
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know where the cameras 
and their blind spots are.</font>

313
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many guards are there?</font>

314
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Four at the entrance,</font>

315
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and two on each floor except the roof.</font>

316
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can handle that.</font>

317
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only real concern is 
Kirara-san's technique.</font>

318
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't do anything about that now.</font>

319
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they can warp Itadori out 
of there or warp in backup,</font>

320
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll give up on persuading Hakari.</font>

321
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still a first-year, Yu-chan?</font>

322
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're young.</font>

323
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Yu-chan"?</i></font>

324
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kin-chan had to repeat 
a year in middle school.</font>

325
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sound happy.</font>

326
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yeah.</font>

327
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been a while since 
Kin-chan's gotten heated up.</font>

328
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see, I love it when 
Kin-chan is passionate.</font>

329
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itadori.</font>

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you believe me if I said</font>

331
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you can earn a million yen a month by 
doing something for just one hour a day?</font>

332
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

333
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

334
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Depends on what that "something" is.</font>

335
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you'll have to pay me 200,000 yen</font>

336
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to buy the information on
what that "something" is.</font>

337
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

338
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe you, then.</font>

339
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. Like you suspected, 
that's a classic con.</font>

340
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The swindler pretends to be rich 
and sells the means to becoming rich</font>

341
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to scam money from others.</font>

342
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's obvious if you
think about it logically,</font>

343
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's a stupid amount
of fools who fall for it.</font>

344
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

345
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all because of passion.</font>

346
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Passion?</font>

347
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both the swindler and the deceived 
have the same passionate drive</font>

348
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to change their lives.</font>

349
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People high on passion lose 
sight of their judgment.</font>

350
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet no one can fall in love 
without passion, either.</font>

351
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love that passion.</font>

352
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know the most direct way 
for people to deal with passion?</font>

353
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gambling?</font>

354
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you would get it.</font>

355
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Life is a gamble.</font>

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Loads of women have dumped me 
because they hate gambling,</font>

357
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they've got it wrong.</font>

358
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our society throws out 
those who can't bet big</font>

359
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and those who don't know when to fold.</font>

360
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't a single person 
who doesn't gamble.</font>

361
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What people hate isn't the gambling,</font>

362
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's losing and being ruined.</font>

363
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't there people who just want 
to live a peaceful life, too?</font>

364
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know anyone like that.</font>

365
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love passion.</font>

366
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Passion is gambling, 
and gambling is life.</font>

367
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And love is control.</font>

368
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the future, I want to control this 
nation's passion through my fight club.</font>

369
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With the existence of curses going public 
and headquarters barely able to function,</font>

370
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this is my chance to expand the business.</font>

371
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to crush the 
obstacles before me</font>

372
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and make them publicly recognize 
my fight club in the coming revisions</font>

373
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to the jujutsu regulations.</font>

374
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At any rate, I'll need a 
strong piece on the board.</font>

375
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itadori...</font>

376
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to get high on my passion?</font>

377
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boss, I need to—</font>

378
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itadori, want something to drink?</font>

379
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm good with anything.</font>

380
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Other than liquor.</font>

381
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, can't handle it?</font>

382
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not the issue. I'm still underage.</font>

383
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't strike me as the 
type to care about that.</font>

384
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you know Satoru Gojo
can't hold his liquor, either?</font>

385
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Who's Gojo?</font>

386
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I never said I couldn't.</font>

387
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look.</font>

388
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

389
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't a single sorcerer who 
doesn't know of Satoru Gojo.</font>

390
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why did you feign ignorance?</font>

391
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you...</font>

392
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">sent by Jujutsu High?</font>
