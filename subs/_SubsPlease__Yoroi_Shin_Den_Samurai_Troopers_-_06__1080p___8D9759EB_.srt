 changing tomorrow.</font>

5
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,370

6
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you still have strength to talk, 
I guess you can go another round.</font>

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The barrier around the Demon World
 is about to break.</font>

14
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,910

00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's there?!</font>

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demon Emperor Ramaga.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryo...</font>

19
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's Mr. Sanada doing there?</font>

20
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know him?</font>

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's one of the original Samurai Troopers.</font>

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, no doubt about it.</font>

24
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,410

His personality is no more.</font>

28
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryo Sanada... He made for a fine vessel, 
but the years have taken their toll.</font>

29
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm gonna be your next Puppet?</font>

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gimme a break!</font>

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't give yourself airs, whelp.</font>

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need better than 
you can offer right now!</font>

33
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,650

34
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To celebrate, I will give you a chance.</font>

35
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that...</font>

36
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Henceforth, we will make our

39
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I grant you seven days' reprieve.</font>

40
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use that time to make yourself 
 a Puppet worthy of me</font>

41
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or to find me another Puppet 
to take your place.</font>

42
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fail me, and I will raze 
this country to the ground.</font>

43
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall lend you the Sword of Domination.</font>

44
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This should prove amusing!</font>

45
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, it would be a shame 
to retreat without doing anything.</font>

46
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

47
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,320

49
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,280

55
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,530

59
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And what's this about destroying 
the country a week from now?</i></font>

60
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have a way to avert it.</font>

61
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's another reason we need the Samurai

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This again?</i></font>

63
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have a plan,</font>

64
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and a secret strategy 
to make them stronger than ever.</font>

66
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Commander.</font>

67
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at these. They all came out awful.</font>

68
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would've taken at least one good one 
if I'd known he was going to die.</font>

69
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, enough's enough! 
Time to shift gears!</font>

70
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei would laugh at me!</font>

71
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to force yourself.</font>

72
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same to you, Commander.</font>

73
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Sanada being Ramaga's Puppet 
must really be weighing on you.</font>

74
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

75
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of, this is really bugging me.</font>

76
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would Ramaga go to all this trouble 
and then decide to wait a week?</font>

77
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good question. 
But it does give us an opportunity.</font>

78
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to ask a favor of you.</font>

79
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel totally defeated.</font>

80
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryu wound up dead, our hero is Ramaga,</font>

81
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Ten Warriors are wicked tough...</font>

82
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have a chance in hell, do we?</font>

83
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People do... just die, don't they?</font>

84
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seeing Ryu pass with my own eyes 
finally brought that home for me.</font>

85
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't been able to stop shaking since.</font>

86
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me neither.</font>

87
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My fear won out over
 my hatred and my anger.</font>

88
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but it's not like 
we can just run away either.</font>

89
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd be so bad about running?</font>

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?</font>

91
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, we're still kids, right?!</font>

92
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why should we have 
to deal with this crap?!</font>

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quitting and getting badmouthed 
for it is better than dying!</font>

94
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Musashi...</font>

95
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then let's all quit together.</font>

96
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you just say?!</font>

97
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to lose any more comrades.</font>

98
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell is wrong with me?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This simulation makes virtual 
enemies from your memories.</font>

138
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do this to yourself?</font>

139
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei told me I should.</font>

140
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That jackass left me 
one hell of a farewell gift.</font>

141
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's made me realize something crazy.</font>

142
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans do nothing but destroy the world.</font>

143
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what my dad taught me, 
and I never doubted him.</font>

144
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when I watched Ryusei die...</font>

145
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It hurt like somebody 
was squeezing my heart.</font>

146
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never felt that way before.</font>

147
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It made me think... maybe every life I 
took made someone else feel like that.</font>

148
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gai...</font>

149
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is your way 
of taking responsibility?</font>

150
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like I think it'll change
what I've done!</font>

151
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you still had to 
put yourself through it.</font>

152
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the—?!</font>

153
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Emergency! Emergency!</i></font>

154
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Intruder on board! 
Initiating emergency stop!</i></font>

155
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Intruder on board! 
Initiating emergency stop!</i></font>

156
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Locating intruder with all due—</i></font>

157
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What just happened?!</font>

158
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said we have an intruder.</font>

159
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go back to the real world and see.</font>

160
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't be happening.</font>

161
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's that jerk!</font>

162
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that any way to talk
 to a senior coworker?</font>

163
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your parents did a bad job raising you.</font>

164
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you have Ryu's Weapon-Gear?</font>

165
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won't need it now that he's dead.</font>

166
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bastard!</font>

167
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a bastard now?</font>

168
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your parents really— 
Oh, wait, you don't have any.</font>

169
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you know that?</font>

170
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Courtesy of the classified intel 
Ryusei gave me.</font>

171
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, he didn't include
how to take over this train.</font>

172
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mirei!</font>

173
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't want to get rough 
with her, but oh well.</font>

174
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you after?</font>

175
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to make a new team 
of Samurai Troopers.</font>

176
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Start making sense, 
you skirt-wearing jackass!</font>

177
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Find some taste before 
you come for <i>my</i> fashion sense.</font>

178
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely you realize that you can't beat 
the Demon Emperor as you are now.</font>

179
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so I decided to lay 
the best runway you could ask for.</font>

180
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to fight me. 
If you lose, you're all fired.</font>

181
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can get off this train 
with a clear conscience.</font>

182
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great plan, right?</font>

183
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't just assume we want out.</font>

184
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds like everyone 
but you does, though.</font>

185
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what if we win?</font>

186
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that event, I'll join you.</font>

187
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Gimme a break!</font>

188
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what Ryusei wanted, 
so deal with it.</font>

189
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But don't worry too much. 
You've got zero hope of beating me.</font>

190
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure like to talk a big game!</font>

191
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Armor of Wilderness!</font>

192
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No Armor-Gear for you.</font>

193
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Under-Gear only. I've changed 
the virtual space's settings.</font>

194
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the same goes for me.</font>

195
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of you come at me, four against one.
 It'll save time.</font>

196
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll show you!</font>

197
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yamato Hojo.</i></font>

198
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You have the most passion 
for being a Samurai Trooper</i></font>

199
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and the most brute strength.</i></font>

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yamato can be intense, 
but he brings life to the team,</i></font>

201
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and the strength he taps into when 
his emotions take over will shock you.</i></font>

202
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meaning you leave more openings 
when you lose your cool.</font>

203
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yama!</font>

204
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it...</font>

205
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make you pay for that!</font>

206
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Musashi Hojo.</i></font>

207
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're agile and specialize
 in quick strikes.</i></font>

208
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Musashi is a pessimist 
and grumbles a lot,</i></font>

209
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but he has a strong sense of justice,</i></font>

210
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and most importantly, he's caring.</i></font>

211
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means you have trouble 
striking hard enough to kill.</font>

212
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kaito Uesugi, you have a sharp mind 
and always assess the situation calmly.</i></font>

213
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kaito seems detached, but he's really 
the most sensitive to others' pain.</i></font>

214
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He thinks of his teammates 
and relies on them.</i></font>

215
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But you're only fifteen. 
You struggle to adapt to the unexpected.</i></font>

216
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that all you've got?</font>

217
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not bad.</font>

218
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's a lot more 
where that came from!</font>

219
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe there's just something wrong 
with my eyes, but...</font>

220
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He looks like Ryusei.</font>

221
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think so too?</font>

222
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why...?</font>

223
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you leave us?</font>

224
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are we supposed to do now?!</font>

225
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I want to know.</font>

226
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That just leaves Gai.</font>

227
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gai.</font>

228
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you fighting for?</font>

229
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Gai is on the verge of really soaring.</i></font>

230
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As long as he stays obsessed with Ramaga,</i></font>

231
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>he won't break out of his shell.</i></font>

232
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't want to become 
your father's next body?</font>

233
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case—</font>

234
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not fighting for that anymore!</font>

235
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My dad'll wreck this world 
whether he makes me his Puppet or not.</font>

236
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm gonna stop him!</font>

237
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna end this stupid war quick 
so no more blood gets spilled for nothing!</font>

238
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's</i> what I'm fighting for!</font>

239
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Awfully idealistic talk for a demon!</font>

240
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not a demon anymore.</font>

241
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei told me.</font>

242
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're already a worthy emissary of Fire.</font>

243
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm...</font>

244
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a Samurai Trooper!</font>

245
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent.</font>

246
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we're heating up.</font>

247
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's right. If we run away now,</font>

248
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even more people are going to get hurt.</font>

249
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go...</font>

250
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go for it!</font>

251
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get him, Gai!</font>

252
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Don't let him beat you!</font>

253
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You know...</i></font>

254
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I like them all.</i></font>

255
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Being with them reminds me</i></font>

256
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>of the time I spent with you.</i></font>

257
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won.</font>

258
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

259
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Way to go!</font>

260
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I call this "Operation
 Gotta Do It for Ryusei"!</font>

261
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't call that an operation.</font>

262
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow...</font>

263
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knew the sky was so blue?</font>

264
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This pain is a step 
toward changing tomorrow.</font>

265
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In your dreams, maybe.</font>

266
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We win.</font>

267
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep your promise.</font>

268
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What promise?</font>

269
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're gonna join us.</font>

270
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weren't you going to quit?</font>

271
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one said anything about quitting.</font>

272
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heroes don't just turn tail and run.</font>

273
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can start by cleaning up.</font>

274
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why should I?</font>

275
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why? Because you're 
the new kid on the block.</font>

276
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, wait, wait. 
I'm older than all of you.</font>

277
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop whining and get to work.</font>

278
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you finish wiping
the place down, start sweeping.</font>

279
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're counting on you, new guy.</font>

280
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to make me cry?</font>

281
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've gotta go rescue Mirei!</font>

282
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that was a farce.</font>

283
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See how I convey "Eek! Save me!" 
with just a look?!</font>

284
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I an actress or what?</font>

285
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man! You nearly gave me a heart attack!</font>

286
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you were in 
on it too, Commander.</font>

287
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All to get our new Samurai Troopers going.</font>

288
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need you all to reach 
the next stage as soon as possible.</font>

289
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What next stage?</font>

290
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Armor of the Supreme Emperor.</font>

291
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The what?</font>

292
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A legendary set of armor 
that can defeat Ramaga.</font>

293
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This boy holds the key to it.</font>

294
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jun Yamano, an ally from our fight
against Demon Emperor Arago.</font>

295
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And where is Mr. Yamano now?</font>

296
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's on this train.</font>

297
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Yamano! Open the door!</font>

298
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he really in there?</font>

299
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably, yeah.</font>

300
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He moved in while the train 
was in storage and refused to leave.</font>

301
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a pain.</font>

302
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're in there, come on out!</font>

303
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want?</font>

304
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've had enough of fighting!</font>
