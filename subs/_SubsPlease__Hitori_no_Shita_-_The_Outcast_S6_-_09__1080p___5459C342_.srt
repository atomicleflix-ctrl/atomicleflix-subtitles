00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Episode 9</font>

2
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's almost done.</font>

3
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as the vital
acupoints are destroyed,</font>

4
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">these stripes will no longer function.</font>

5
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since the Sect Leader never 
truly approved of this valley,</font>

6
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll destroy it myself.</font>

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This whole ordeal is finally over.</font>

8
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who said it's over?</font>

9
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

10
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think I gave 
Zhang Chulan my phone number?</font>

11
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if that kid doesn't contact me,</font>

12
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll contact him myself.</font>

13
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Contact him? For what?</font>

14
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

15
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are your parents?</font>

16
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is your master?</font>

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My master forbade me to speak of it.</font>

18
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, right. I always felt that 
Feng Baobao seemed familiar,</font>

19
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I shouldn't have met her before.</font>

20
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really haven't met her before.</font>

21
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are no treasures in 
the "What Is Human" cave.</font>

22
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It only contains things that 
the Sect Leader values.</font>

23
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Many of us in the Quan Xing Sect have 
seen some of those things before.</font>

24
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan...</font>

25
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing, San?</font>

26
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You took Baobao and Xia Liuqing of 
Quan Xing on a mission behind our backs,</font>

27
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and got involved with 
someone like Wang Zhenqiu.</font>

28
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any idea how much 
danger you've put Baobao in?</font>

29
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you considered the consequences?</font>

30
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think you're doing?</font>

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San...</font>

32
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was indeed dangerous.</font>

33
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Open it and take a look.</font>

34
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

35
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wu Gensheng's treasure.</font>

36
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I managed to get my hands on it.</font>

37
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

38
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Baobao?</font>

39
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was the first one to rush in back then,</font>

40
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and in front of me was this painting.</font>

41
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the time, there was 
no way for me to take it,</font>

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I could only take
a photo with my phone.</font>

43
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lighter's flame was too weak.</font>

44
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to ensure the entire painting, 
including the canvas, was destroyed.</font>

45
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to force myself to shatter it
with the Thunder Palm technique.</font>

46
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew the black ash on the 
ground might raise suspicion,</font>

47
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I simply didn't have the strength 
or time to deal with it back then.</font>

48
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As soon as I got to the city, 
I printed the photo and deleted it.</font>

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With someone like Erzhuang around, 
I had to be careful.</font>

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... why did you say that 
even we couldn't be trusted?</font>

51
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd feel the same way.</font>

52
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There really is no one left to trust.</font>

53
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, my suspicion of you 
two is purely based on logic.</font>

54
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emotionally, you two are more worthy 
of Baobao's trust than I am.</font>

55
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San, don't you get it?</font>

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The thing Father always cared about has...</font>

57
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wu Gensheng's treasure was taken long ago,</font>

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">yet this painting was left behind.</font>

59
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the person in this 
painting really is Bao'er,</font>

60
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then the person Grandpa Xu 
has been searching for,</font>

61
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">someone who knew Bao'er, 
has finally appeared.</font>

62
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this painting was deliberately 
left for me and Bao'er,</font>

63
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then how did they know we'd go there?</font>

64
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lu Jin? Didn't you say Lu Jin 
mentioned Granny Jinfeng to you?</font>

65
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, but the one who first introduced 
me to Granny Jinfeng wasn't Master Lu.</font>

66
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was...</font>

67
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">back then...</font>

68
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in Biyou Village.</font>

69
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chen Duo herself said she was suddenly 
tasked with capturing Jinfeng.</font>

70
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The timing coincided exactly 
with our capture of Chen Duo.</font>

71
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that, capturing Chen Duo inevitably 
brought Jinfeng into the picture.</font>

72
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the information Jinfeng provided 
led us to the "What is Human" cave.</font>

73
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, they made arrangements for 
those foreigners ahead of time,</font>

74
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and among them, one woman was clearly 
prepared to deal with Bao'er.</font>

75
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the goal?</font>

76
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not clear yet.</font>

77
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If my guess is correct,</font>

78
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then none of this is a coincidence.</font>

79
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now do you understand?</font>

80
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To have orchestrated all this, 
they must meet two conditions.</font>

81
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, knowing Baobao
and Chulan's movements.</font>

82
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Second, understanding
the Company very well.</font>

83
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both of us meet these conditions.</font>

84
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only ones capable of doing this</font>

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are the bigwigs who could 
deploy Part Timers back then.</font>

86
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The suspects are among them.</font>

87
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this a convenient time?</font>

88
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If possible, I'd like to meet 
with you to discuss this.</font>

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

90
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong, Sister?</font>

91
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting...</font>

92
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Chairman of the Company, 
Zhao Fangxu, wants to see me.</font>

93
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to worry about this.</font>

94
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's the Furnace?</font>

95
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got experience now,
 so it'll be quick.</font>

96
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just...</font>

97
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with me.</font>

98
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back when you founded Biyou Village,</font>

99
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wasn't it to gather Outcasts who could 
provide samples for the Furnace?</font>

100
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not opposed to what you're doing.</font>

101
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just that you've 
never been careful enough.</font>

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember the 12 Shanggenqi Mutants?</font>

103
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the end, the Company still 
found out about them, right?</font>

104
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These 15 people cover various 
types of Outcast powers.</font>

105
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They should be sufficient for your needs.</font>

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one knows about their connection to us,</font>

107
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they won't raise any suspicions.</font>

108
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always felt that if you 
had been the one, Sister,</font>

109
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">maybe the perfect Furnace would 
have been built long ago.</font>

110
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget it.</font>

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't master ordinary techniques,
let alone Divine Craftsmanship.</font>

112
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I can do is fully support you.</font>

113
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xianhong, trust me.</font>

114
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as you can build the 
perfect Cultivation Furnace,</font>

115
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'll definitely recover 
your fragmented memories.</font>

116
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's not speculate about Baobao's 
relationship with Wu Gensheng for now.</font>

117
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As things stand,</font>

118
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it seems the person behind the scenes</font>

119
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">knows far more about Baobao than we do.</font>

120
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we find them, then 
everything will be clear.</font>

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that simple.</font>

122
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they had to go through all this trouble 
just to convey a bit of information,</font>

123
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then they must have some reservations.</font>

124
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reservations?</font>

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reservations about what?</font>

126
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

127
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Baobao, seeing this painting really 
doesn't jog any memories at all?</font>

128
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope!</font>

129
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care what their reservations are,</font>

130
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the existence of such a person 
makes me extremely nervous!</font>

131
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me too.</font>

132
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's something else 
we need to talk about.</font>

133
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know Zhang Lingyu?</font>

134
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, Chairman Zhao mentioned him to us.</font>

135
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He wants you to recruit
him into the Company.</font>

136
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Let Zhang Lingyu
work alongside Baobao?</font>

137
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way! Absolutely not!</font>

138
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why should we put an outsider 
like Zhang Lingyu next to Baobao?</font>

139
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San, I've discussed this 
with Bao'er, and she agreed.</font>

140
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean "she agreed"?</font>

141
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does she have the judgment to decide this?</font>

142
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Baobao, do you know how dangerous this is?</font>

143
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan said it'd be fine.</font>

144
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The longer Zhang Lingyu spends with me, 
the less likely he is to harm me.</font>

145
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what if something does happen?</font>

146
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan, are you treating 
Baobao's safety as a joke?</font>

147
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San, I've thought about this.</font>

148
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Baobao needs strength around her
and time to prepare for any eventuality!</font>

149
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Si and I are the strength behind Baobao!</font>

150
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not enough.</font>

151
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still no!</font>

152
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Lingyu is worth the risk.</font>

153
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do we have to take the risk...?</font>

154
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough, San.</font>

155
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Calm down.</font>

156
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do we have to take risks?</font>

157
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because the situation is already dire!</font>

158
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our biggest advantage has 
always been staying hidden.</font>

159
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one knows what we're doing,</font>

160
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or what our goal is.</font>

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now this painting has exposed us.</font>

162
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hiding carefully is 
meaningless at this point.</font>

163
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this point,</font>

164
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what's wrong with taking a risk 
to develop a potential "ally"?</font>

165
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San, if it weren't for Father's request,</font>

166
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would you still protect Baobao?</font>

167
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

168
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

169
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why?</font>

170
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because that's the 
kind of people we are.</font>

171
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are all the good people 
in the world in our family?</font>

172
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure Zhang Lingyu 
isn't that kind of person?</font>

173
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There could be other candidates.</font>

174
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm still concerned about that 
hand reaching out to Bao'er.</font>

175
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San, Si, do you know what 
happened with the Lyu Clan?</font>

176
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lyu Clan?</font>

177
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're a really troublesome clan.</font>

178
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the Lyu Clan?</font>

179
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, it is strange.</font>

180
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A group of them did come out,</font>

181
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they all quickly went 
back to their village.</font>

182
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Father, Lyu Liang still isn't talking.</font>

183
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

184
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What he did was preposterous,</font>

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he's still got backbone.</font>

186
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As expected of a member of the Lyu Clan.</font>

187
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of all the Outcast clans 
that I've come across,</font>

188
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Lyu Clan is the most perverse.</font>

189
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They have an abnormal 
obsession with bloodline.</font>

190
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's understandable, though, given their 
ability to manipulate others' minds.</font>

191
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an exceptionally isolated village,</font>

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where your status is 
determined by your powers.</font>

193
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Lyu Clan passes down two skills:</font>

194
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the acquired Ruyi Jin,</font>

195
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the innate Bright Soul Skill.</font>

196
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those who can't cultivate qi 
manage the clan's businesses,</font>

197
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they have absolutely 
no say in clan matters.</font>

198
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if a clan member without 
powers leaves the village,</font>

199
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they can't cut ties with the clan.</font>

200
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All their actions are monitored by 
the village, especially marriage.</font>

201
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite inhumane, isn't it?</font>

202
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know if any Lyu 
Clan members ever rebelled.</font>

203
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most people in the village 
have the Lyu surname.</font>

204
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for the few outsiders, they're all men.</font>

205
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Lyu Clan only accepts son-in-law.</font>

206
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They treat these sons-in-law
 well materially,</font>

207
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but their status is probably 
the lowest in the village.</font>

208
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ruyi Jin is only passed to males
 and not females.</font>

209
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By controlling these sons-in-law,</font>

210
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they ensure all awakened users of the 
Bright Soul Skill have the Lyu surname.</font>

211
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Through these methods, they maintain 
control over their Outcast powers,</font>

212
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">standing above others.</font>

213
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one who now controls the entire clan 
is the current clan leader, Lyu Chi.</font>

214
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bro, you're amazing, seriously amazing!</font>

215
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're getting better and better!</font>

216
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never catch up to your 
Ruyi Jin in this lifetime.</font>

217
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What use is that?</font>

218
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can I compare to you?</font>

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You win by default.</font>

220
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, don't be like that!</font>

221
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With innate talent, who 
knows when it might awaken!</font>

222
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cut the crap. Anyway, I've never 
heard of anyone awakening after 30.</font>

223
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, so what?</font>

224
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean you're doomed?</font>

225
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, beneath Great-Grandfather,</font>

226
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:05,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Chi</font>

227
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:05,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Zhong - Xiao - Ping - Yi</font>

228
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's Grandfather Zhong, 
Second Great-Uncle Xiao,</font>

229
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Third Great-Aunt Ping, 
and Fourth Great-Uncle Yi.</font>

230
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandfather and Third Great-Aunt awakened.</font>

231
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Second and Fourth Great-Uncle didn't.</font>

232
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Second Great-Uncle's Ruyi Jin was 
passed down from Great-Grandfather.</font>

233
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fourth Great-Uncle simply wasn't 
cut out for cultivating qi.</font>

234
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great-Grandfather never favored him.</font>

235
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So back then, it's said that the one 
who truly won Great-Grandfather's favor</font>

236
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was Grandfather, who had both 
Ruyi Jin and Bright Soul Skill!</font>

237
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But by the third generation, the uncles' 
generation, things got awkward.</font>

238
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The entire generation produced quite 
a few promising qi cultivators,</font>

239
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but very few awakened!</font>

240
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And their level was nowhere near 
Grandfather and Third Great-Aunt.</font>

241
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you have to admit, when it 
comes to acquired cultivation,</font>

242
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's hardly anyone in the clan 
that Great-Grandfather acknowledges.</font>

243
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even including our own father, would he 
really give these uncles a second glance?</font>

244
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But who would have thought, 
in our generation,</font>

245
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so many would awaken Bright Soul Skill!</font>

246
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Children from many families have awakened,</font>

247
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and their levels aren't bad.</font>

248
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Naturally, Great-Grandfather is happy.</font>

249
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if we're talking about the 
strongest in this generation,</font>

250
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it has to be the children of 
Second Great-Uncle's son and daughter,</font>

251
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the children of Uncle Ping and Aunt Feng.</font>

252
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uncle Ping had two children,
 the brothers Lyu Gong and Lyu Liang.</font>

253
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the most extraordinary one 
has to be Aunt Feng's daughter, Lyu Huan.</font>

254
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was the strongest user of 
Bright Soul Skill in the entire clan,</font>

255
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and her talent for acquired 
cultivation was also extremely high.</font>

256
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great-Grandfather even made an 
exception and taught her Ruyi Jin!</font>

257
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like that, the previously 
unremarkable Second Great-Uncle,</font>

258
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">along with his entire branch, 
saw their status skyrocket!</font>

259
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uncle Ping! Who's he? He's simply not
cut out for cultivating qi at all!</font>

260
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now, even he can say a few words 
in front of Great-Grandfather.</font>

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Second Great-Uncle became highest-ranked
in the clan after Great-Grandfather!</font>

262
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now?</font>

263
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything has changed!</font>

264
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The killer is Lyu Liang,</font>

265
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he's completely finished.</font>

266
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As his biological brother, Lyu Gong can't 
hold his head up in the clan either.</font>

267
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Second Great-Uncle has no other 
outstanding descendants left.</font>

268
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Among the younger generation,</font>

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who can still compete with us, 
the descendants of Grandfather?</font>

270
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you see, now we just need to sit 
back and laugh at Second Great-Uncle.</font>

271
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're all brothers.
 Why create conflict between us?</font>

272
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But tell me, do you really think 
Lyu Liang accidentally killed Huan?</font>

273
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's never admitted it.</font>

274
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I were him, I'd have confessed long 
ago with this kind of interrogation!</font>

275
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was also asked to interrogate 
that Lyu Liang kid once.</font>

276
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His memories were all 
jumbled up. Weird, right?</font>

277
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He actually used his power on himself!</font>

278
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Used it on himself?</font>

279
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you can do all sorts of things 
with Bright Soul Skill.</font>

280
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not just about testing or peeking 
into other people's memories.</font>

281
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lyu Liang has already reached a 
level beyond my understanding.</font>

282
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Lyu Huan is said to 
be far above Lyu Liang.</font>

283
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop thinking about it.</font>

284
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lyu Liang killed Lyu Huan.</font>

285
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was him!</font>

286
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat.</font>

287
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you playing dead or what? Eat!</font>

288
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think just because you act 
tough, I'll respect you, right?</font>

289
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think you're safe just 
because you can take a beating?</font>

290
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think that by denying it, 
this matter will just go away?</font>

291
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say something!</font>

292
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Father! Grandfather!</font>

293
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of you, they can't hold their 
heads up in the village anymore!</font>

294
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't get any worse!</font>

295
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only way you can atone
for your sins now</font>

296
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is to tell everyone exactly 
what happened that day!</font>

297
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least let the clan know 
how Huan really died!</font>

298
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Haven't I already told you all... 
about what happened that day?</font>

299
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you.</font>

300
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you from the very beginning.</font>

301
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're also one of the awakened ones.</font>

302
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should at least be able 
to tell if I'm lying, right?</font>

303
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You copied my memories, didn't you?</font>

304
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So... this is what's kept 
you going all this time.</font>

305
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After Lyu Huan died, you became the 
strongest user of Bright Soul Skill.</font>

306
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know very well that when it comes to 
thoroughly examining someone's memories,</font>

307
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">apart from you, only I can do it,
and barely at that.</font>

308
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I have no idea how long it would take.</font>

309
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then at least you can 
confirm my current state!</font>

310
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been sealed now, so I can't use 
Bright Soul Skill to resist you!</font>

311
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! See if I'm lying!</font>

312
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on!</font>

313
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huan once said to me...</font>

314
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huan! Isn't your brother 
Lyu Gong a handsome guy?</font>

315
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

316
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's the truth!</font>

317
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you said you could lie to me!</font>

318
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only is my brother 
Lyu Gong a handsome guy,</font>

319
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he also has three heads, 
six hands, eight feet,</font>

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">twelve noses, twenty eyes, thirty...</font>

321
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait!</font>

322
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

323
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How... How did you do that?</font>

324
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From your perspective just now, 
there wasn't any sign of lying.</font>

325
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I couldn't feel you using 
Bright Soul Skill to resist me either.</font>

326
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't resist, and I didn't lie to you.</font>

327
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From my perspective, everything 
I just said was the truth.</font>

328
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can that be?</font>

329
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what, Brother, I'm starting 
to realize that extracting memories</font>

330
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and detecting lies through 
mental fluctuations</font>

331
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are just the basics of what 
Bright Soul Skill can do.</font>

332
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These blue hands are getting 
stronger and more agile.</font>

333
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Previously unreachable places within the
mind can now be easily touched.</font>

334
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Recently, I've even found 
a way to modify emotions.</font>

335
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}TRUTH
TRUTH</font>

336
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just now, while I was lying,</font>

337
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:56,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}TRUTH
LIE</font>

338
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I adjusted my mind to a 
state of truthfulness.</font>

339
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I call this "passive emotion."</font>

340
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You... can do something like that?</font>

341
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's amazing!</font>

342
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, this isn't enough.</font>

343
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Passively giving emotions
isn't perfect yet.</font>

344
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This basically means I deceived myself 
when the situation required it.</font>

345
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once the situation requiring 
a lie disappears,</font>

346
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the lie is still a lie.</font>

347
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I could find this place,</font>

348
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if I could even manipulate 
people's perceptions,</font>

349
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}TRUTH</font>

350
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then I could create reality 
within subjective consciousness.</font>

351
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be the most perfect deception.</font>

352
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Creating real perceptions within 
someone's consciousness.</font>

353
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is what's been bothering 
you these past few days?</font>

354
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry! You'll definitely 
be able to do it!</font>

355
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one in the village is 
more capable than you!</font>

356
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah... it's not about that.</font>

357
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Then what is it?</font>

358
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brother, if I really did it,</font>

359
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wouldn't you find me terrifying?</font>

360
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How should I put it...</font>

361
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't quite explain it.</font>

362
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really want to understand 
how that would work,</font>

363
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm a bit afraid.</font>

364
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's there to agonize over?</font>

365
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like I can do it.</font>

366
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I could, I'd be laughing in my sleep!</font>

367
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're worried that you'd use 
such incredible power for evil?</font>

368
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impossible!</font>

369
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it were that idiot
Lyu Liang, I'd worry.</font>

370
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're Huan!</font>

371
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Powers are just powers.</font>

372
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Powers don't change who you are!</font>

373
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Am I overthinking it?</font>

374
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lyu Liang, purely in terms 
of ability, I admire you.</font>

375
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Truly, I admire you.</font>

376
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've also been able to reach this level,</font>

377
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the ability to modify your perception.</font>

378
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you gone mad, Lyu Gong?</font>

379
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anything else in your 
head besides Bright Soul Skill?</font>

380
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a person, not a machine that 
solves everything with powers!</font>

381
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want from me 
to make you believe me?!</font>

382
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great-Grandfather.</font>

383
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave.</font>

384
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great-Uncle, Grandfather,
Third Great-Aunt...</font>

385
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has Great-Grandfather already decided...</font>

386
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">how to deal with Lyu Liang?</font>

387
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great-Grandfather, you...</font>

388
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Agree to my three conditions,</font>

389
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you can leave.</font>
