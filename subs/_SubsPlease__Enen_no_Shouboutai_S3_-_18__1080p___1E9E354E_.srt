I'd like to take a good look around,</font>

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vul, do you know what the key is?</font>

23
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no doubt that it's the starter

24
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there's that string of numbers.</font>

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This technology is incredible.</font>

26
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, it is, but from what I can see,</font>

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this area is all just support

28
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking at the data from the

29
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the hole for the key should

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amaterasu's structure is

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get separated from us, Arthur-san!</font>

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! Hey! It's pitch black!</font>

39
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you serious? It's completely broken.</font>

40
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe something that 
Vulcan built could break.</font>

41
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I use my flames for light?</font>

42
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's too enclosed here.</font>

43
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd be bad if any combustible 
gases caught fire.</font>

44
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The core isn't far from here.</font>

45
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take the lead.</font>

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use the lights on our fireproof
suits as markers and stay close.</font>

47
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

48
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. Let's go.</font>

49
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to the map, 
it's just up ahead...</font>

50
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">on the other side of these doors.</font>

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't any power, is there?</font>

52
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are we gonna open them?</font>

53
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those doors look pretty big.</font>

54
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This, here. Yu.</font>

55
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

56
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made sure to bring it.</font>

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Ultra External Battery!</font>

58
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. Now they'll open!</font>

59
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the core my ancestor 
built for Amaterasu.</font>

60
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for opening that for me.</font>

61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feeler!</font>

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone is guarding the entrance!</font>

63
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you get in here?!</font>

64
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Insects can creep in from anywhere 
before you even realize it, right?</font>

65
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arthur, I'll leave him to you! 
The rest of us will support...</font>

66
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Where did he go?!</font>

67
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Arthur-san get separated from us?</font>

68
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, are you serious?</font>

69
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a will o' the wisp.</font>

70
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where have Vulcan and the 
others disappeared to?</font>

71
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Companions abducted 
by the Demon King.</font>

72
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An abyssal dungeon.</font>

73
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be a rescue event!</font>

74
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a knight, it was naïve of me 
to attempt to skip a rescue event</font>

75
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in order to battle Dragon King Dracon.</font>

76
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Knight King, Arthur Boyle,
shall overcome this trial without fail!</font>

77
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vulcan, what do we do?</font>

78
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arthur isn't here. We just 
have to handle it ourselves!</font>

79
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Yu?</font>

80
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! I am feeling very grateful!</font>

81
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To you, Vulcan, and to Lisa-san 
for saving me back then, of course!</font>

82
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But also to Shinra-san and 
Arthur-san, to the sister,</font>

83
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and to everyone in the 8th 
who looked after me.</font>

84
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that I'm alive now 
thanks to all of you!</font>

85
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's all the doctors and nurses 
who performed procedures on me, too!</font>

86
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This world is just overflowing 
with so much love!</font>

87
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was able to realize that once more</font>

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">thanks to the wound that sent 
me to the brink of death!</font>

89
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much, Giovanni-san!</font>

90
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for shooting me!</font>

91
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Now stand back.</font>

92
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

93
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is I who wishes to express gratitude.</font>

94
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For over 250 years, you've kept it safe.</font>

95
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our key to Amaterasu, that is.</font>

96
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's my ancestor's key!</font>

97
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then do you know what this is?</font>

98
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I have a guess as to what's inside.</font>

99
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's pi, right?</font>

100
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed it is.</font>

101
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In ancient times, the Evangelist implanted
pi as the incantation of destruction.</font>

102
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incantation?</font>

103
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humanity has continued to chant 
this incantation of destruction.</font>

104
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now that the image of that 
destruction has been established,</font>

105
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the computation of pi is finally complete.</font>

106
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The computation of pi 
is complete? You idiot.</font>

107
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pi continues infinitely.</font>

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be completed!</font>

109
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was true before the 
previous Great Cataclysm.</font>

110
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whether it's then or now, 
it doesn't affect pi!</font>

111
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you see the moon 
and stars in the night sky?</font>

112
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The physical laws of 
this world have changed.</font>

113
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just as the last Great Cataclysm turned 
human combustion into a mainstream event,</font>

114
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">pi has now become completable.</font>

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now that pi has been solved,</font>

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">humanity is finally straining to 
reach the end of its evolution.</font>

117
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The end?</font>

118
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There is a theory that the end of an 
organism's evolution is destruction,</font>

119
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that theory is correct.</font>

120
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">While striving for the destruction 
that lies at the end of evolution,</font>

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">humanity has conjured an 
image of a wish for death.</font>

122
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That image is the Great Cataclysm,
as well as their goal</font>

123
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to return to the flames
and to go home to the sun!</font>

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why the sun?</font>

125
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are dying and the sun related?</font>

126
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Long ago, the star that we 
now refer to as the sun</font>

127
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">saw the essence of its image transform</font>

128
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to conform with destruction, 
and it became a star of flames.</font>

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This planet, in the 
coming Great Cataclysm,</font>

130
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will become a second sun!</font>

131
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of the human pillars 
who have disappeared</font>

132
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are now in Adolla, fulfilling their roles.</font>

133
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be. I don't believe it!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vulcan-kun, I heard everything.</font>

What a ridiculous thing to say.</font>

151
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,370

266
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why Yu wanted to become an 
engineer who could make things from junk,</i></font>

267
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and why he'd come to my workshop.</i></font>

268
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd already decided
I wasn't taking apprentices.</i></font>

269
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So I brought Yu in as 
a member of my family.</i></font>

270
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I still remember</i></font>

271
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>how Yu smiled in that moment.</i></font>

272
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After a while, Lisa showed up, too,</i></font>

273
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and it was the three 
of us living together.</i></font>

274
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As their older brother, I swore that
I'd protect Yu and Lisa, no matter what.</i></font>

275
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yay!</font>

276
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was only an engineer in a tiny workshop,
but I was going to make them happy!</i></font>

277
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Vulcan-kun!</i></font>

278
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An Insect got Yu.</font>

279
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What?</i></font>

280
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't let Yu turn into 
an Infernal like this!</font>

281
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help him, Licht! I need knowledge!</font>

282
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is there some method besides magnetic 
fields that can control the Insects?</i></font>

283
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me! That's why I'm here!</font>

284
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you listening, Vulcan-kun?</font>

285
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Methods by which Insects 
control their fellows...</font>

286
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given your circumstances, 
there are two possibilities!</font>

287
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first is to use the magnetic fields</font>

288
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you disrupted to control 
their sense of direction.</font>

289
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other is the specific,</font>

290
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>unique dance of the honeybees!</i></font>

291
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's highly likely that Doctor Giovanni is
using that dance to control the Insects!</i></font>

292
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please stop the individual 
bug that is dancing!</i></font>

293
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lisa!</font>

294
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

295
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never forgive him.</font>

296
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're stopping him, no matter what!</font>

297
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever it takes,
I'm gonna slaughter him!</font>

298
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lisa!</font>

299
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He modified a type of Insect so that 
it wouldn't be affected by magnetism,</i></font>

300
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and now it's dancing to control 
the rest of the swarm?</i></font>

301
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No. He's cautious enough to repeatedly 
strike a stone bridge before crossing.</i></font>

302
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't imagine he'd use an Insect with
greater chances of irregularities arising.</i></font>

303
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's an engineer, too.</i></font>

304
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He wouldn't have used Insects.</i></font>

305
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>To control them,
he'd have built Insect mechs!</i></font>

306
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If it's a mech, then its heat source 
and movement should be different!</i></font>

307
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In this giant swarm of Insects,</i></font>

308
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I will find the mechs that 
are controlling them all!</i></font>

309
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Where? Where are they?</i></font>

315
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,430
