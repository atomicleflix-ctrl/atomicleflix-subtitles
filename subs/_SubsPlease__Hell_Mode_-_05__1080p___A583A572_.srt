00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, they're here!</font>

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Took you long enough to heal up, Rodin!</font>

4
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sorry to worry you, fellas.</font>

5
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">As you can see, I'm fit as a fiddle!</font>

6
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, the little guy's really tagging along?</font>

7
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah. As I'm sure you've heard,
we're adopting Allen's hunting strategy this time.</font>

8
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But he's only tagging along to watch.</font>

9
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I won't get in the way. Thanks for having me.</font>

10
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sigh. I wanted to be part of the hunt.</font>

11
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But Dad's such a hardhead. He wouldn't budge.</font>

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, well.</font>

13
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The important thing is that we train the newbies
to help the group hunt more boars.</font>

14
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't want to see anybody
get hurt like that again.</font>

15

16
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,960

17
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please don't cover for me
if anything goes wrong today.</font>

18
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's no biggie. Focus on your role in the hunt!</font>

19
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Uh, yessir.</font>

20
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay! Let's move out!</font>

21
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Right!</font>

22
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My seventh year living as a serf
and I finally get to leave the village.</font>

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">One small step forward!</font>

24
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Those must be the White Dragon Mountains.</font>

25
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Every fall, the boars leave the foot of the
mountains to come here in search of food.</font>

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And legends say that a mythical White Dragon
lives somewhere near the summit.</font>

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The fantasy vibes are through the roof!</font>

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, Allen! You getting cold feet or what?</font>

29
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No way!</font>

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just stick to what we practiced.</font>

31
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Everybody to your posts!</font>

32
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Right!</font>

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay!</font>

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Incoming!</font>

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, yeah, that's terrifying!</font>

36
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dig in those heels, men!</font>

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hold fast!</font>

38
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Rodin!</font>

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The bait team lures the boar in.</font>

40
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then the tank team holds it in place.
And finally, the strike team attacks its vitals.</font>

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is the method my dad and the
others have used to hunt successfully</font>

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">for over 10 years without any talents!</font>

43
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's almost time! Please get ready!</font>

44
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">S-sure thing!</font>

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It was a mistake to count on weenies like them
to tank anything in the first place.</font>

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mr. Gerda!</font>

47
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Better not spear me in the ass by mistake!</font>

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Y-yessir!</font>

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They should only need to attack it
once to gain experience from the battle!</font>

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Good! Strike now!</font>

51
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can feel power flowing through me!</font>

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Does that mean we overcame a Trial of the Gods?</font>

53
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, thank the Lord!</font>

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sweet! Just as planned!</font>

55
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sounds like they leveled up.</font>

56
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Since boars are C-rank monsters,
they must have gained a lot of EXP!</font>

57
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How did I make out?</font>

58
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Damn! I got squat!</font>

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ugh. Figures that it doesn't consider me
part of the battle for just standing nearby.</font>

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen!</font>

61
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your advice made all the difference!</font>

62
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you!</font>

63
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Great. You're welcome.</font>

64
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This sucks. A victory laced
with the bitter taste of defeat.</font>

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yo, Allen! You coming along on today's hunt?</font>

66
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yep! I'll be there to watch as usual.</font>

67
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But do me a favor. Tell my dad
he should let me try wielding a spear, too!</font>

68
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No can do. Rodin would kick our butts
for even suggesting it.</font>

69
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm jealous. Wish I could join the hunt, too.</font>

70
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then put down your butcher's knife for once
and tag along.</font>

71
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not when my wife's got a kid in her belly!</font>

72
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've gotta play it safe for her sake.</font>

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fair.</font>

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I'm always happy to have
more monster meat to carve up!</font>

75
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh?</font>

76
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, pops.</font>

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I ain't that old yet, kid. What's up?</font>

78
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Can I ask you for a favor?</font>

79
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, what did you need?</font>

80
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoa! These are albaherons!</font>

81
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I was hoping you'd butcher them for me.</font>

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There are just too many for me to handle.</font>

83
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll give you two packs of meat
for each one you take care of.</font>

84
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Really now? You sure?</font>

85
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes!</font>

86
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">These aren't part of our food reserves.</font>

87
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I need him to break down the carcasses
so I can sell the meat.</font>

88
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have to use something to earn those 50 gold
coins to get my family out of serfdom, after all.</font>

89
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It would cost extra to have
a butcher in town do it, anyways.</font>

90
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So it's better to just outsource the job here,
which also means fewer trips overall.</font>

91
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gotta make the most of my time!</font>

92
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are you guys sure about this?</font>

93
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Absolutely. We already
pulled it off once. Don't freak out.</font>

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">By gradually adding new people to the team,
we'll eventually have enough to make two groups.</font>

95
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That should double the
amount of boars we can hunt.</font>

96
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I wish I knew why the baron
was so hung up on having more boars.</font>

97
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't get the impression his territory
is suffering from food shortages.</font>

98
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Boar incoming!</font>

99
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Brace yourselves!</font>

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Attack now!</font>

101
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Get over here, newbies!</font>

102
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can feel it! Another Trial of the Gods complete!</font>

103
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Same here!</font>

104
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow! You're right!</font>

105
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I feel so much stronger!</font>

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah, welcome back.</font>

136
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Did you have a good time at the chieftain's place?</font>

137
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yep! You two should have come with us.</font>

138
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sitting through all that pomp and circumstance
is a boring way to start the new year.</font>

139
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now, let's get this party started!</font>

140
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mm-hmm!</font>

141
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yum!</font>

142
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Does it taste good, Mash?</font>

143
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah! It's nummy, big brudder!</font>

144
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ain't that nice?</font>

145
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, did the chieftain
have anything to say about us?</font>

146
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah, he was really appreciative.</font>

147
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Given how things are going, we shouldn't have
a problem meeting the quota of 20 boars this year.</font>

148
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's all thanks to Allen and his plan
to train the newbies.</font>

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">By the way, Allerino...</font>

150
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes?</font>

151
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Do my eyes deceive me, or is that
a special bottle of something behind you?</font>

152
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, this? It's liquor.</font>

153
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The chieftain gave it to me as a gift.</font>

154
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hook, line, sinker.</font>

155
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now to reel 'em in.</font>

156
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, hey, Mash!
Want to do more spear training soon?</font>

157
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah!</font>

158
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I wanna train, too!</font>

159
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Forget it. You're already strong enough, Krena.</font>

160
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We gotta nurture Mash
cuz he has the makings of a spear user.</font>

161
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh yeah?</font>

162
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's the deal?</font>

163
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dunno.</font>

164
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's it. Like moths to the flame...</font>

165
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is something the matter?</font>

166
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, ya know, since the chieftain
sent you home with that liquor...</font>

167
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yep! It was a gift he gave to me!</font>

168
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, come on!</font>

169
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's not be silly now, kid.</font>

170
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's so silly? He gave it to me, so it's mine-</font>

171
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But everybody knows
you're not old enough to drink it!</font>

172
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah, what he said!</font>

173
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, shucks.</font>

174
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I guess I'll let you have it,
but only if you beat me in a contest.</font>

175
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A contest?!</font>

176
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh? What do you mean?</font>

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You against the two of us?</font>

178
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's right.</font>

179
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fine by me. You're on!</font>

180
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait, Gerda!</font>

181
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, but...</font>

182
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What do I get from you if I win?</font>

183
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Boo! Are you two really that stingy?</font>

184
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, why don't you tell us what you want?</font>

185
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I win the contest...</font>

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">you have to let me wield a spear
during all the boar hunts this year.</font>

187
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We walked right into his trap.
He's a smart little cookie.</font>

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll be damned.</font>

189
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right.</font>

190
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If we win, we get the liquor.
And if you win, you can fight in the boar hunts.</font>

191
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No take-backs!</font>

192
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh jeez...</font>

193
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't see a problem with it.
We could use a little entertainment!</font>

194
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, what kind of contest did you have in mind?</font>

195
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Arm wrestling, of course!</font>

196
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Arm wrestling?!</font>

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Bring it on.</font>

198
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sorry, kid. But I ain't going easy on you.
Not with liquor on the line.</font>

199
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I stocked my inventory
full of Fido cards just for this.</font>

200
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All buffs into attack power!</font>

201
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not to mention, I'm level six now!
I've got this in the bag!</font>

202
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Get ready...</font>

203
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and go!</font>

204
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoa. What the-? Aw hell!</font>

205
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw hell! Aw hell! Allen!</font>

206
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoa there!</font>

207
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aaaaand BAM!</font>

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dammit! I lost!</font>

209
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're so cool, Big brudder!</font>

210
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whew! That was a close one!</font>

211
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">From what I can tell, Gerda's attack stat
must be somewhere between 150 and 200.</font>

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, Allen. I'll wait until
the soreness in your arm wears off.</font>

213
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, wow. I never realized
how calloused Dad's hands were...</font>

214
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's proof of how hard he works for us every day.</font>

215
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So big and hulking.</font>

216
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's hard to believe.</font>

217
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My son's old enough
to wanna compete with his old man.</font>

218
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The earlier you all treat me
like an adult, the better!</font>

219
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've gotta put in a hundred times more effort
than everybody else!</font>

220
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And it all starts with raising my stats
by leveling up!</font>

221
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, get ready...</font>

222
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and go!</font>

223
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Rodin takes it!</font>

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw yeah!</font>

225
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Guess I've gotta take the L...</font>

226
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">His attack stat has to be over 300 at least!</font>

227
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You win this one, Dad.</font>

228
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here. It's yours.</font>

229
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Look.</font>

230
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hooray! Time to drink!</font>

231
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah!</font>

232
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Considering their strength,
Gerda's attack stat is around D-rank.</font>

233
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">While Dad's is more like C-rank.</font>

234
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That at least gives me a reference for how strong
the people playing on normal mode can get.</font>

235
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You should know better
than to go so hard on a child!</font>

236
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't let it get you down, Allen.</font>

237
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?</font>

238
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, I guess they thought I looked upset.</font>

239
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They're right. You're not weak by any means.</font>

240
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm just too strong is all!</font>

241
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But you're not hunting any boars
until you have what it takes to beat me!</font>

242
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Nice. I'm gonna hold him to that.</font>

243
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I stand a decent shot of making that happen
if I can get to summon level four before fall!</font>

244
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, Dad. I'll give up on hunting for now!</font>

245
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I'll beat you eventually!</font>

246
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, Mathilda! We need more snackage!</font>

247
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,670

249
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just bring me something to snack on, already!</font>

250
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay. You were saying?</font>

251
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Nothing.</font>

252
