00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, everyone! 
How are you all doing?</font>

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm doing swimmingly, of course!</font>

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morn, morning!</font>

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Morn, morning! Morn, morning!</font>

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning.</font>

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're in great spirits so early.</font>

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter? I said good morning.</font>

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's yours truly.</font>

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get ready 
for the morning broadcast.</font>

11
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About the revisions to the script...</font>

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talk to me, dumbass!</font>

13
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that for?!</font>

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't just ignore me! 
Ask me what's bugging me!</font>

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, sorry about that. 
Did something happen?</font>

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not telling you.</font>

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your problem?!</font>

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen 
a hit-and-run in a convo before.</font>

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to talk about it or not?</font>

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up! Shut up!</font>

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have things to do, so I'm leaving!</font>

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's her deal?</font>

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gotta love it when she bleps.</font>

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She joined the theater club 
last week as a temp helper.</font>

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The theater club?</font>

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it looks like it 
hasn't been going so well.</font>

27
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She agreed to it since it'd 
help her practice her acting.</font>

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh... Knowing her, I'd think 
she could work with anyone.</font>

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please. Nene-chan actually 
shuns people she isn't close to.</font>

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's cheery in class, though, of course.</font>

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nene only likes people who like her.</font>

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Her?</font>

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate all the people who hate me!</font>

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That does make sense.</font>

35
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you do something 
about this, Yamabuki-kun?</font>

36
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't say. Not without 
knowing what the cause is...</font>

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't, Bucky?</font>

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be absurd.</font>

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How am I meant to resolve this 
when she doesn't want to talk about it?</font>

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, acting and voice acting 
aren't quite one and the same.</font>

41
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Half-baked advice would only 
plant weird ideas in her head.</font>

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unfortunately, nobody can give her 
a helping hand right now.</font>

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unless...</font>

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's me, yours truly!</font>

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hook, line, and sinker!</font>

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, he's so fun to egg on.</font>

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THEATER CLUB</font>

48
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

49
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please forgive me for being so pathetic!</font>

50
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was the one closest to you,</font>

51
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and yet I couldn't give you all my love!</font>

52
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oizumi-san's been in the zone lately.</font>

53
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her dream is to become an actress 
and marry a celebrity to get his money.</font>

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What happened to marrying 
the heir of a big corporation?</font>

55
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If... If you'll forgive me—</font>

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if you're still willing 
to give me your love—</font>

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">won't you tell me that 
you love me once more?!</font>

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep. I love you.</font>

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wassup with that?!</font>

60
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oizumi-san?!</font>

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cut, cut. Stop the cameras.</font>

62
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have any.</font>

63
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himekawa-san!</font>

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you this before. 
Did you actually read the script?</font>

65
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? I did...</font>

66
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not the impression I'm getting.</font>

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How uncharacteristically meek of her!</font>

68
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen up.</font>

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This scene has a couple oh-so-in-love,</font>

70
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and yet the foolish man 
has run to another woman</font>

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">after a trivial disagreement.</font>

72
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He then desperately begs for forgiveness 
like the pathetic loser he is!</font>

73
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girl has mixed feelings, but 
she bottles them up and forgives him.</font>

74
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a highly complex and powerful scene.</font>

75
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And yet, this is how you acted it out...</font>

76
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Yep! I wuv you!"</font>

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's shallow as hell!</font>

78
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oizumi-san?!</font>

79
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stop throwing yourself 
at the equipment.</font>

80
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too shallow! Your acting is a sham!</font>

81
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-A sham?</font>

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I put a lot of thought into it.</font>

83
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm acting for real.</font>

84
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Thought"? Don't tell me...</font>

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You actually think when you're acting?</font>

86
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

87
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not supposed to 
think while you act.</font>

88
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you cry or get angry, do you 
stop to think, "Okay, time to cry"?</font>

89
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emotions are born of impulses, 
not conscious thought.</font>

90
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that not the case for you?</font>

91
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I...</font>

92
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unbelievable.</font>

93
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to think to answer 
that question, too?</font>

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see. I've heard of this before.</i></font>

95
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take it from the top.</font>

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get it right this time, Himekawa-san.</font>

97
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How irritating! 
What exactly did I do wrong?</i></font>

99
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I agreed to help because 
it'd improve my acting,</i></font>

100
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but if I was gonna be berated like this, 
I wish I hadn't! Ugh!</i></font>

101
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Do I think when I'm acting? 
Of course I do!</i></font>

102
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My brain is in overdrive!</i></font>

103
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I just don't have anything to base it on, 
unlike with anime and manga!</i></font>

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How do I put on a good performance? 
How can I portray the emotions?</i></font>

105
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even now, I'm thinking about all that.</i></font>

106
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...won't you tell me 
that you love me once more?</font>

107
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I think and I think and I think...</i></font>

108
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yep... I love you...</font>

109
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The restroom's out the door 
and to the right.</font>

110
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm not holding it in!</font>

111
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Massage the pressure point 
behind your knee to wake up your legs.</font>

112
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-My legs aren't asleep!</font>

113
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I never expected her to be so meek 
outside her comfort zone!</i></font>

114
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Let's have another great day today.</i></font>

115
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, time to go back to class.</font>

116
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it just me, or is she 
getting grumpier by the day?</font>

117
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Disaster will strike our village 
if we don't offer a sacrifice.</font>

118
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gah! This just pisses me off!</font>

119
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn that Oizumi girl!</font>

120
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Don't think, feel"? 
Who are you, Bruce Lee?</font>

121
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Emotions are impulses"? She's just 
saying random crap to boost her ego!</font>

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of it makes any sense!</font>

123
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're such a good girl, Nene. 
You do everything your dad wants.</i></font>

124
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Of course I think about it.</i></font>

125

126
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, Yamabuki-kun's going in.</font>

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want?</font>

128
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw what happened 
in theater club yesterday.</font>

129
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

130
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something I want to say.</font>

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

132
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you here to cheer me up or something?</font>

133
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been wondering...</font>

134
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your hair ornaments.</font>

135
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they an homage to stag beetles?</font>

136
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you come here just to ask me that? 
You piss me all the way off!</font>

137
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell are you thinking?!</font>

138
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that's impulsive, Himekawa.</font>

139
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you think before you got mad 
and sent me flying just now?</font>

140
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shaddup!</font>

141
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

142
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was trying, okay?</font>

143
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the way, Himekawa.</font>

144
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your raw emotions are spilling out.</font>

145
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And yet...</font>

146
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She just kept berating me! I hate it!</font>

147
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent! This makes for great acting!</font>

148
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Empty your mind and obey your instincts!</font>

149
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to get back at her? 
Let's do just that!</font>

150
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you some special training!</font>

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Over my dead body!</font>

152
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good! You're showing a lot of feeling!</font>

153
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FEELINGS ARE IMPULSIVE</font>

154
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They often say to 
"get into character," but...</font>

155
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt you can do it for something 
you don't have experience with.</font>

156
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not a professional 
actress, after all.</font>

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, to play the role 
of someone who's been cheated on,</font>

158
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'll first need to experience 
being cheated on yourself.</font>

159
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On that note...</font>

160
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry! Please forgive me 
for cheating on you!</font>

161
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not even dating!</font>

162
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The role you're playing...</font>

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is a woman cheated on after a fight 
by a man she was happily dating,</font>

164
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she still forgives him.</font>

165
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that correct?</font>

166
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

167
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

168
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Suppose a cheater professed 
his love for you again.</font>

169
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you actually say you 
love him just like in the script?</font>

170
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Erm...</font>

171
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd think about it, right?</font>

172
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess.</font>

173
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why experiencing it 
is the way to go.</font>

174
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The impulse you feel then will 
make your acting authentic.</font>

175
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're doing this again?</font>

176
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to pretend to be your girlfriend</font>

177
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and also have to experience 
being cheated on?</font>

178
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you going to cheat on me with?</font>

179
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That'd be me.</font>

180
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha... Why Iko?</font>

181
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because I'm in love with Bucky.</font>

182
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha?!</font>

183
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or so the story goes. 
Don't take it seriously.</font>

184
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She just has the most free time now.</font>

185
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you and I are in love, 
and you cheat on me with Iko?</font>

186
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't sound realistic. 
There's no point.</font>

187
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to let Oizumi get away 
with trash-talking you, then?</font>

188
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'll mock you forever, 
saying you're all voice and go,</font>

189
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Oh, I guess all those faceless voice 
actors just aren't that good at acting!"</font>

190
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you want revenge?</font>

191
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you want to make her pay?</font>

192
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I so wanna get back at her!</font>

193
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! That's the spirit!</font>

194
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make her cry uncle!</font>

195
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great! Your feelings are exploding!</font>

196
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make her kneel 
and lick my shoes!</font>

197
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know about that.</font>

198
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's begin our special training, then.</font>

199
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll take this somewhere more suitable.</font>

200
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

201
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

202
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's just...</font>

203
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

204
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always been a pain to deal with.</font>

205
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind at all.</font>

206
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A girl who's a handful has her own charm.</font>

207
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The heck was that? Buzz off.</font>

208
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Furin High School</font>

209
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you have it.</font>

210
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me and Ki... Iko have been 
going out in secret.</font>

211
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're my one true love.</font>

212
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please...</font>

213
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you give me one more chance?!</font>

214
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bathroom is over there.</font>

215
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh! I knew you'd say that!</font>

216
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, it just doesn't feel real to me.</font>

217
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't imagine Iko going out with you.</font>

218
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the love of my life, darling.</font>

219
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Till death do us part.</font>

220
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is fake as hell.</font>

221
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose it'll take a while. 
Take your time and get used to it.</font>

222
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we done for today?</font>

223
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Iko and I will go 
finish up some club tasks.</font>

224
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I just don't see this working out.</i></font>

225
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Iko and him dating? 
I simply can't picture it...</i></font>

226
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>one bit...</i></font>

227
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I guess it's not totally impossible.</i></font>

228
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Anyway...</i></font>

229
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm kinda curious what it feels like</i></font>

230
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to have someone you love stolen from you.</i></font>

231
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Arisu.</font>

232
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long will we have to 
hide our relationship?</font>

233
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just bear with it. If anyone 
found out we were dating,</font>

234
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it'd be a major headache.</font>

235
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really wanna have you all to myself,</font>

236
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that's asking too much, huh?</font>

237
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, isn't it fun to pretend 
that we're acting?</font>

238
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess, yeah.</font>

239
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Are those two really... What? No way!</i></font>

240
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No way! No freaking way!</i></font>

241
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's looking at us 
and her eyes are popped out.</font>

242
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop! Don't look! You'll give it away!</font>

243
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this prank really going to work?</font>

244
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, Shinobu and Rikka said so.</font>

245
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

246
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want Nene-chan 
to experience being cheated on?</font>

247
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

248
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All you need to do is get a girlfriend.</font>

249
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You make it sound so easy.</font>

250
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean a fake one, of course.</font>

251
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she sees you get lovey-dovey 
with another girl in secret,</font>

252
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it'll be a big shock for her.</font>

253
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, wait.</font>

254
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't this plan fall apart 
if she doesn't like me?</font>

255
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what if she doesn't have 
<i>any</i> positive feelings for me?</font>

256
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get over yourself, you dumbass!</font>

257
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate you!</font>

258
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Things got awkward between us, too.</font>

259
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think she likes you 
well enough, Yamabuki-kun.</font>

260
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she really hated you, 
you'd have been kicked out long ago.</font>

261
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep, yep.</font>

262
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

263
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, who's gonna be the girlfriend?</font>

264
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.</font>

265
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rock, paper, scissors!</font>

266
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The prank does seem 
to have worked, but now what?</font>

267
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, isn't Nene-chan more distraught 
than we thought she'd be?</font>

268
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's frozen stiff.</font>

269
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if it's not exactly cheating,</font>

270
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured she'd be taken aback to see 
a guy she's close to dating her friend.</font>

271
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she's way more than taken aback.</font>

272
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heck, those two froze up, too.</font>

273
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, they expected Nene-chan 
to jump in to stop them,</font>

274
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they probably have 
no idea what to do next.</font>

275
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is a problem. 
There's nothing for us to do.</i></font>

276
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Himekawa's still frozen.</i></font>

277
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe we should start over.</i></font>

278
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

279
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, have you ever kissed anyone?</font>

280
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have, yeah.</font>

281
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Who? And when?</font>

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was fairly recently.</font>

283
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have feelings for Bucky?</font>

284
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really. I hate all boys.</font>

285
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... well,</font>

286
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's better than the other 
boys I know, at least.</font>

287
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nene was being cagey back then,</font>

288
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I guess I'll be upfront about it.</font>

289
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

290
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to kiss you.</font>

291
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

292
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

293
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like you, Arisu.</font>

294
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FEELINGS CAN ESCALATE</font>

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to kiss you.</font>

296
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like you, Arisu.</font>

297
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see how it is. Good call, Kirino.</i></font>

298
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Couples kiss. This will 
make us look more convincing.</i></font>

299
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Now Himekawa will have 
no choice but to step in.</i></font>

300
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, I'm still not convinced 
that doing this will make her jealous.</i></font>

301
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But yours truly is pretty good 
with fake kisses.</i></font>

302
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was always the prince 
in preschool plays, after all.</i></font>

303
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Isn't she getting too close, though?</i></font>

304
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is she really going to stop in time?</i></font>

305
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, is she actually going to kiss me?</i></font>

306
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's getting a bit too into the role!</i></font>

307
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hold it, Kirino!</i></font>

308
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Are you seriously...</i></font>

309
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop right there!</font>

310
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What are you two thinking? 
We're at school, you know?!</font>

311
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hell, you shouldn't be doing 
this outside school, either!</font>

312
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is neither the time, 
the place, nor the occasion!</font>

313
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Calm down, Nene-chan.</font>

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. They were just acting.</font>

315
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us explain from the top.</font>

316
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's the story.</font>

317
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for tricking you.</font>

318
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it wouldn't have seemed as real 
if we hadn't done that.</font>

319
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not mad or anything.</font>

320
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Was this experience 
helpful for your acting?</font>

321
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hell if I know!</font>

322
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ack, is she actually mad?</font>

323
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be fine... I think.</font>

324
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should calm her down some.</font>

325
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nene-chan.</font>

326
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This whole thing was Shinobu's idea.</font>

327
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Rikka-chan?!</font>

328
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really came through, Kirino.</font>

329
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea what to do back there.</font>

330
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think you'd pretend to kiss me. 
It made us look like a real couple.</font>

331
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right? My ad lib saved 
your skin back there.</font>

332
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a second, I panicked</font>

333
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because I thought you 
might really kiss me.</font>

334
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say...</font>

335
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you ever kissed Nene, Bucky?</font>

336
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, now. Of course not.</font>

337
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. It's not much, but thank you.</font>

338
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't?</font>

339
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did she tell you otherwise?</font>

340
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really.</font>

341
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why would you ask me that?</font>

342
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

343
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want your drink instead.</font>

344
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already took a sip from it, though?</font>

345
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine.</font>

346
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you say so.</font>

347
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make do with this for now.</font>

348
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bitter!</font>

349
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you couldn't handle coffee.</font>

350
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THEATER CLUB</font>

351
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

352
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please forgive me for being so pathetic!</font>

353
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I admit it!</font>

354
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am a complete and utter fool!</font>

355
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has taken me this long to realize 
how important you are to me!</font>

356
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My rose only blooms in splendor</font>

357
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because I have you, my sun!</font>

358
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it me, or is her acting 
getting more showy?</font>

359
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed Himekawa-san 
actually came back.</font>

360
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After getting that flak, too! 
She has guts!</font>

361
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If...</font>

362
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'll forgive me—</font>

363
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if you're still willing 
to give me your love—</font>

364
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">won't you tell me 
that you love me once more?!</font>

365
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to see your 
stupid mug ever again.</font>

366
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get out of my sight.</font>

367
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time out!</font>

368
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himekawa-san, that's not the right line.</font>

369
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're way too scary.</font>

370
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're supposed to forgive 
the protagonist there.</font>

371
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that was fine.</font>

372
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oizumi-san?!</font>

373
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your expression and line 
delivery were excellent.</font>

374
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It felt real, like you'd 
actually been cheated on.</font>

375
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your emotions truly shone through!</font>

376
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did someone cheat on you for real?</font>

377
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something like that, yeah.</font>

378
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, really? Tell me more!</font>

379
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What more do you want me to say?</font>

380
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got my payback.</font>

381
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Praise me.</font>

382
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I saw. You were amazing.</font>

383
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's embarrassing when 
you're so direct about it.</font>

384
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're getting along 
with the members, too.</font>

385
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I've learned to be 
more open with my feelings</font>

386
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and speak my mind whenever I can.</font>

387
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's good to hear.</font>

388
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might've played a part.</font>

389
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

390
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I kinda get it when 
they say emotions are impulsive.</font>

391
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They slip out even when 
you try to bottle them up.</font>

392
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to use that in my acting.</font>

393
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've actually shown some growth.</font>

394
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Putting on an act with Iko was worth it.</font>

395
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still... The kiss was going too far.</font>

396
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}NO ENTRY</font>

397
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on.</font>

398
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was Kirino's ad lib.</font>

399
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I expected you to butt in much earlier.</font>

400
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh...</font>

401
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

402
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I hadn't stopped you, 
would you two have actually kissed?</font>

403
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kirino and all you teenage girls 
sure love to talk about this stuff.</font>

404
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was all an act. 
There's no way we'd do that.</font>

405
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

406
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Iko might've been serious, you know?</font>

407
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a chance.</font>

408
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it were me...</font>

409
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might've kept going and kissed you.</font>

410
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

411
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Nothing! I'm outta here!</font>

412
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

413
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is your fault, okay?</font>

414
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I'm saying whatever pops into my head!</font>

415
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How is that my...</font>

416
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just kidding.</font>

417
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must've looked 
pretty impulsive, right?</font>

418
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I needed to get some 
payback for that prank.</font>

419
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I've gotten better at acting.</font>
