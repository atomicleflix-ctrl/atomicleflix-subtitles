1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it.</font>

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How the hell's he live out here? 
There's jack shit around.</font>

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's got the mountains and the river.</font>

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's plenty.</font>

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds plenty inconvenient.</font>

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But perfect for training, I guess.</font>

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for dropping in suddenly.</font>

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to stay here for a while.</font>

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought some food!</font>

10
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

11
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?!</font>

12
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bastard.</font>

13
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have the nerve 
to show your face to me?!</font>

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Whoa...</font>

16
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard from Mitsuba!</font>

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently the Bat Man got 
the better of you?</font>

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Tackle was injured 
badly in the fight.</font>

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's...</font>

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Transform! V3!</font>

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Wh-Whoa! Let's not fight!</font>

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have no right to call yourself 
a Rider right now!</font>

23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, on your feet!</font>

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to beat your 
Rider love back into shape!</font>

25
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">V3...</font>

26
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Screw Kick!</font>

27
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was for Tackle.</font>

28
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this...</font>

29
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is for me!</font>

30
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so is this!</font>

31
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also this!</font>

32
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And last...</font>

33
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One for me!</font>

34
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Whoa...</font>

35
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, you put your tail between 
your legs and ran here?</font>

36
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that! I was bringing him to—</font>

37
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No excuses!</font>

38
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Risking your life against evil 
organizations to defend the world!</font>

39
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that what a Rider does?!</font>

40
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like the look in your eyes.</font>

41
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess your Rider love 
isn't dead after all.</font>

42
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, give me everything...</font>

43
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you have!</font>

44
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rider...</font>

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Transformation!</font>

46
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kamen Rider!</font>

47
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">V3 Screw—</font>

48
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rider...</font>

49
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Punch!</font>

50
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impressive!</font>

51
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the fight has only begun!</font>

52
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, knock it off!</font>

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">V3...</font>

54
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rider...</font>

55
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit, fine then!</font>

56
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeeee</i>nough already!</font>

57
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Electric Heat Chop!</font>

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Punch!</font>

59
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're that Shocker combatant 
from the other day.</font>

60
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you doing here?</font>

61
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just noticed?</font>

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's been through a lot,</font>

63
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and now he's determined 
to take Shocker down.</font>

64
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please. It'll be a while... 
but let me hide here.</font>

65
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides...</font>

66
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We brought food!</font>

67
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So be it. A temporary ceasefire.</font>

68
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now, come in.</font>

69
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

70
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explains why a Shocker combatant 
is determined to bring Shocker down!</font>

71
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My guys sacrificed themselves 
to let me get away.</font>

73
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm their aniki. I'm supposed to 
be the one who protects <i>them</i>!</font>

74
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tojima knows this story, but...</font>

75
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This house used to be 
where my grandparents lived.</font>

76
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was a kid, they were 
both killed by the Bat Man.</font>

77
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever since, I've been 
determined to get strong!</font>

78
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if you're frustrated, too, 
then you need to get strong!</font>

79
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry about before.</font>

80
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Attacking you out of the blue like that...</font>

81
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Bat Man.</font>

82
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was he as strong as I remember?</font>

83
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way Shocker waged battle 
was incredibly organized.</font>

84
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think we can't beat them 
if we try to do it individually.</font>

85
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're allies. We need to work together.</font>

86
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allies, huh?</font>

87
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never live down the fact that 
I turned and ran from Shocker,</font>

88
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even if it was to protect my allies...</font>

89
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't ever want to run again.</font>

90
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, I need to get stronger!</font>

91
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please. Let us train with you.</font>

92
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for the food!</font>

93
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll start training tomorrow! 
Don't expect any mercy!</font>

94
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That works for me!</font>

95
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong? You're not gonna eat?</font>

96
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, the inside of my mouth 
is all torn up</font>

97
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from when you two laid into me...</font>

98
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't have any strength 
if you don't eat!</font>

99
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to do it, 
for the sake of your so-called guys!</font>

100
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've taken such good 
care of us until now...</font>

101
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's right! This is the least we can do!</font>

102
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for everything!</font>

103
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd they let me escape?!</font>

104
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What's wrong?</font>

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Giving their lives 
for a scumbag like me...</font>

106
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stupid idiots!</font>

107
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only natural to risk everything 
to protect someone you care about.</font>

108
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-They care about me?!</font>

109
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I couldn't do 
a damn thing for them?!</font>

110
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

111
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we have another match 
with these bento boxes on the line?</font>

112
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds good.</font>

113
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do it!</font>

114
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do what?</font>

115
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The three of us will fight. The winner 
gets the remaining two bento boxes.</font>

116
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... there's two of them! 
Why don't you just each eat one?</font>

117
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not the point!</font>

118
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The winner... gets to eat both.</font>

119
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who gives a shit?! 
And who'd wanna eat three lunches?!</font>

120
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so pitiful, Shocker!</font>

121
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you seriously fighting again?!</font>

122
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because you refused to eat!</font>

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will help us train 
and build strength.</font>

124
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two birds with one stone.</font>

125
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Can I really keep up with these freaks?</i></font>

126
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the Combat Girls' agency.</font>

127
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's huge!</font>

128
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A building like this, in Tokyo?</font>

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've gotta be rolling in it.</font>

130
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to Tojima-san,</font>

131
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">their manager-slash-agency 
head is the Bat Man...</font>

132
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morio Koda. That's apparently his name.</font>

133
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you heard of him, Yukarisu?</font>

134
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, this is all new to me.</font>

135
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. He seems pretty well-known 
in the industry, though.</font>

136
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He makes plenty 
of appearances in the media...</font>

137
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And seems to use his position 
to do whatever he wants.</font>

138
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,990

We climbing trees or something?</font>

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, it still hurts!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">V3...</font>

200
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big Wheel Kick!</font>

201
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?!</font>

202
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this? 
Aren't you like, good friends?</font>

203
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you just playing around?</font>

204
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure don't seem like it!</font>

205
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit, you guys...</font>

206
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should you really be unloading on each 
other if you're on the same side?</font>

207
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all messed up. Damn.</font>

208
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, time to get up.</font>

209
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made some hotpot.</font>

210
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Smells good...</font>

211
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no beef in it.</font>

212
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks good!</font>

213
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for the food!</font>

214
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Delicious!</font>

215
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This really tastes incredible!</font>

216
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's good!</font>

217
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks...</font>

218
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is good!</font>

219
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, didn't you make it yourself?</font>

220
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you good at cooking?</font>

221
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say that.</font>

222
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when you live on your own, 
you can whip up something like this.</font>

223
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you?</font>

224
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. I either get 
takeout or frozen food.</font>

225
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I cook, but everything I make 
just tastes like the ingredients.</font>

226
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you season this or something?</font>

227
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With what, exactly? 
All you've got in this place is salt.</font>

228
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I did was put it in water, 
add some salt, and boil it a bit.</font>

229
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is the secret ingredient love?</font>

230
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why the hell would it be?</font>

231
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was in elementary school...</font>

232
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I ended up in the hospital once 
because of how cool Kamen Rider is.</font>

233
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the second episode,</font>

234
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when he was facing off against 
the enemy in the darkness...</font>

235
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kamen Rider's eyes lit up!</font>

236
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it was so cool...</font>

237
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That I passed out 
and hit my head on a table!</font>

238
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get you!</font>

239
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When my mother found me, 
she took me to the hospital.</font>

240
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well, passing out is a little extreme...</font>

241
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But even for a Shocker fan like me, 
that scene was awesome.</font>

242
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their whole bodies didn't light up 
the way modern heroes' do,</font>

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that's what made it so good.</font>

244
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was nothing more exciting!</font>

245
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was... the light 
that lit my soul on fire.</font>

246
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the same vein, 
I once ended up in the hospital</font>

247
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because of how I looked up to V3.</font>

248
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You too?!</font>

249
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In episode seven of V3, 
Pops was operating a wrecking ball,</font>

250
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to help V3 train to withstand hundreds 
of kilograms with just his body.</font>

251
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I think I remember that one...</font>

252
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried to mimic it by filling 
a sack with a bunch of rocks,</font>

253
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hanging it from a tree branch,</font>

254
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and having Mitsuba swing it 
at me from up high.</font>

255
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get you!</font>

256
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bag was heavier than I expected, 
and I ended up knocked off a cliff.</font>

257
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That... is not something a kid should do.</font>

258
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandpa and Grandma were furious with me.</font>

259
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to get injured training 
to become a Rider, too.</font>

260
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm amazed you guys survived this long.</font>

261
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something crazy about 
the way you guys play Rider.</font>

262
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have never once in 
my entire life "played" Rider!</font>

263
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Likewise!</font>

264
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being a Rider means living 
under the shadow of death.</font>

265
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, if you're the real deal...</font>

266
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I <i>am</i> V3!</font>

267
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Rider 1!</font>

268
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, okay.</font>

269
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even as we speak, we're engaged 
in a battle against Shocker!</font>

270
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's right!</font>

271
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, as weird as it is, you're right.</font>

272
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't even mind dying 
in battle against Shocker.</font>
