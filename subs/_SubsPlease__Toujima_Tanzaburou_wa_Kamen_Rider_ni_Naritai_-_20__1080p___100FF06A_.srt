00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all right?</font>

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah...</font>

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit, it still hurts! Shit!</font>

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Guess I oughta work on my baseline</i>
<i>before transforming into a combatant, huh?</i></font>

11
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How the hell are you two
so strong, anyway?</font>

12
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's obviously because...</font>

13
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we train every day.</font>

14
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like, <i>every</i> day? How long
have you been livin' like this?</font>

15
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't give you an exact date,
but it's been over ten years.</font>

16
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ten...?!</font>

17
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanted to join Shocker, right?
Didn't you train for it?</font>

18
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that was more part
of the gangster routine.</font>

19
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys are way more serious about this
than I ever was about joining Shocker.</font>

20
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Shocker <i>is</i> destined to be
defeated by the Riders, after all.</font>

21
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. The training would've gone to waste.</font>

22
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell was that?!</font>

23
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.</font>

24
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm amazed you two
don't get sick of this stuff.</font>

25
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd kill for some real meat.</font>

26
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a needy one, aren't you?</font>

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meat, huh...</font>

28
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, there are options.</font>

29
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?! Where are they?</font>

30
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A living chicken?</font>

31
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can bring this bird down,
we'll have chicken hotpot tonight.</font>

32
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't they do this in <i>Rocky</i>?</font>

33
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This bird looks like
he's seen better days.</font>

34
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not sure he'd taste good
even if I caught him.</font>

35
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll understand once you get started.</font>

36
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get to it, then.</font>

37
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always wanted to try this,
to be honest.</font>

38
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's supposed to be great reflex
and lower body training.</font>

39
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get a move on.</font>

40
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure this isn't too easy?</font>

41
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd think so, right?</font>

42
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But for the record,
I've never been able to catch him.</font>

43
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Gotcha.</i></font>

44
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow! Whoa!</font>

45
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow, ow, ow!</font>

46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hurts!</font>

47
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yow, knock it off! Are you kidding me?!</font>

48
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell?! Wait a sec!
It's trying to kill me!</font>

49
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make it stop!</font>

50
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This really is a good way to train
your reflexes and lower body.</font>

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it, though?</font>

52
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

53
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Damn.</font>

54
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A gangster, getting his ass
handed to him by a rooster...</font>

55
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you gonna be okay? You seem to be
running a fever from all those scratches.</font>

56
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll manage.</font>

57
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like that bird taught me a lesson.</font>

58
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What lesson?</font>

59
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That I'm a small fry.</font>

60
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kind of wimp who can't
even take down a rooster!</font>

61
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking back, all I've done for
the past 44 years was... survive.</font>

62
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never had any hopes.
Just learnin' how to give up.</font>

63
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in the end, I couldn't even protect
the men who'd dedicated themselves to me.</font>

64
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got nothing now.</font>

65
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have anything, either.</font>

66
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Likewise.</font>

67
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you two do!</font>

68
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something that's crucial to really living!</font>

69
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right in here!</font>

70
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's what I'm missing.</font>

71
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno how to put it into words, though.</font>

72
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey!</font>

73
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really going out
in that condition?</font>

74
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, I'm like a frog who's
been half-swallowed by a snake,</font>

75
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but hasn't realized it yet.</font>

76
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, where are you going?</font>

77
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To train myself to death.</font>

78
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

79
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm weak! Weak! Weak! Weak!</i></font>

80
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm supposed to be their aniki?!</i></font>

81
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And a gangster?!</i></font>

82
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a load of shit...</i></font>

83
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No wonder I can't even beat a bird!</i></font>

84
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm gonna work at it</i>
<i>until I find what I'm missing.</i></font>

85
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said he was gonna train
until he dies, but...</font>

86
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been three hours,
and he still hasn't come back.</font>

87
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all right?!</font>

88
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's foaming at the mouth.</font>

89
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-One hundred ninety-seven...

92
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I ain't done yet!</font>

93
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dammit. I'm not gonna...</i></font>

94
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not gonna stop
until I get where I'm going!</font>

95
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's looking better lately.</font>

96
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

98
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna do some light sparring?</font>

99
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

100
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep it light, okay?</font>

101
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll try to.</font>

102
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's pretty fast.</i></font>

103
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But!</i></font>

104
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gotcha!</font>

105
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a good one!</font>

106
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

107
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Couldn't see it coming, could you?</font>

108
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess.</font>

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This punch...</font>

110
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will be how I take down the bird!</font>

111
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not Shocker?</font>

112
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it.</font>

113
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe Shocker's
sponsoring an event like this.</font>

117
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,920

to me, except you!</font>

118

It's the perfect disguise!</font>

124

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I've heard a rumor...</font>

138
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that the winners of this tournament...</font>

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will have their whole lives change!</font>

140
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder how, though...
Maybe the prize money?</font>

141
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's more than that, I bet!</font>

142
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But let's ask someone who'd know...</font>

143
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our previous winner, BlackTights203!</font>

144
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A combatant?!</font>

145
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone's looking sharp
in all that black!</font>

146
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very cool!</font>

147
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you have to say?</font>

148
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has there been any change in your life
since you won the last tournament?</font>

149
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, definitely.</font>

150
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever since he shared his power with me,</font>

151
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've felt more joy in life
than ever before.</font>

152
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's he talking about?</font>

153
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is amazing!</font>

154
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Joy in your life, huh?</font>

155
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

156
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I used to walk around town,
I'd end up prey for petty thugs!</font>

157
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that sounds awful!</font>

158
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now, I just clobber them
and send them running!</font>

159
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

160
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to this tournament,
I've won every fight I've gotten into since.</font>

161
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you have the power
he gave you to thank for that.</font>

162
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a bad feeling about this.</font>

163
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are the rest of you satisfied
with who you are right now?</font>

164
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This world is so unfair... Haven't you
ever wished you could just tear it down?!</font>

165
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is he talking about?</font>

166
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure what the deal is here.</font>

167
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you don't have to worry any longer!</font>

168
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that you're here, you'll obtain
enough power to stand up to anyone!</font>

169
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can use it against
anyone you don't like...</font>

170
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And crush them all!</font>

171
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's make this world...
one that belongs to us!</font>

172
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now to introduce our
super-duper VIP guest!</font>

173
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tournament's sponsor...</font>

174
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morio Koda-sama!</font>

175
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's him!</font>

176
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Bat Man!</font>

177
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome, you foolish humans.</font>

178
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You find yourselves despairing at
how asinine your society has become,</font>

179
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and seek to immerse yourselves
in this fantasy world as a result.</font>

180
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But is that really enough?</font>

181
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't run from reality, y'know!</font>

182
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing will ever change if you do that.</font>

183
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to give you power.</font>

184
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Join Shocker and together
we will rule the world!</font>

185
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is bad news, right?</font>

186
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get out of here.</font>

187
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sooner, the better.</font>

188
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

189
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The doors won't open!</font>

190
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we trapped in here?!</font>

191
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}EMERGENCY EXIT
There!</font>

192
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow, ow...</font>

193
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

194
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, yeah.</font>

195
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for the hel...</font>

196
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you're...</font>

197
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Puunyan from the Little Busters!</font>

198
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always been a fan of yours!</font>

199
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what are you doing in a—</font>

200
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Join Shocker now, and each and
every one of you will get a girlfriend.</font>

201
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And...</font>

202
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll all be idols!</font>

203
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, boys!</font>

204
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're joining Shocker!</font>

205
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This is...</font>

206
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do we do, Mitsuba?!</font>

207
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, well.</font>

208
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I sensed a Shocker combatant.</font>

209
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like there's a rat
crashing our party.</font>

210
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say...</font>

211
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I ask you something?</font>

212
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

213
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This ain't no ordinary rooster, is it?</font>

214
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very observant.</font>

215
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a Shamo, a type of bird
raised for cockfighting.</font>

216
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured.</font>

217
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a legendary champion in the
underground world of cockfighting,</font>

218
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and in human terms, he'd be 120 years old.</font>

219
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's been enjoying
his retirement out here.</font>

220
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That don't explain
how he <i>got</i> here, though.</font>

221
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My grandma used to breed
roosters for fighting.</font>

222
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explains it...</font>

223
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And why he's as intense
as a martial arts master.</font>

224
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, if you're ready...</font>

225
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then</font>

226
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">begin!</font>

227
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's coming out the gate at full throttle!</font>

228
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And he's as fast as ever!</i></font>

229
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I can actually follow his moves now!</i></font>

230
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Gotta keep my eyes on him...</i>
<i>watch how he moves, keep defending,</i></font>

231
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and wait for the perfect opening!</i></font>

232
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Build up my strength like in</i>
<i>an old-fashioned catapult...</i></font>

233
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it!</font>

234
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">.44 Magnum!</font>

235
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Shocker combatant wins.</font>

236
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The name's Nakao!</font>

237
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nakao wins!</font>

238
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hell yeah!</font>

239
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think you'd actually pull it off.</font>

240
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was getting ready to go next.</font>

241
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys are unbelievable.</font>

242
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's impressive.</font>

243
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess... it's a tie then?</font>

244
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for your guidance!</font>

245
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't let it bother you.</font>

246
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How exactly?!</font>

247
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That stray cat's been out
to get him for a while now.</font>

248
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Always lurking around
outside his enclosure...</font>

249
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Shamo...</font>

250
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the nature of combat.</font>

251
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He pried my eyes open
after a life of lethargy.</font>

252
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking back now,
I always thought I was on my own.</font>

253
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I always had the boys with me.</font>

254
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ito. Ishige. Sato.</font>

255
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The three of you were,
without a doubt, my brothers.</font>

256
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry it took so long
for me to realize it.</font>

257
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Shamo... thank you for everything!</font>

258
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to take down Shocker
for the sake of my brothers!</font>

259
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granted, I'm not the star of this act,
so I'll probably die in the process...</font>

260
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm ready for what comes next.</font>

261
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna go train.</font>

262
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just lightly enough that it
doesn't slow down the others.</font>

263
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've had a pretty simple life...</font>

264
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I wouldn't complain.</font>

265
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

266
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ran all the way
into the damn mountains.</font>

267
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This works out nicely.</font>

268
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was...</font>

269
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I WAS CRAVING A BATTLE WITH SHOCKER
...crav<i>yeee</i>ng...</font>

270
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...a battle with Shocker!</font>

271
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring it on, then.</font>
