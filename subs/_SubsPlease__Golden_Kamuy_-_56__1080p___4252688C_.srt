47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,710

make one, every step of the process,</font>

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I could make one for 
myself when I grew up.</font>

49
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,490

52
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you need the wood from an Ezo

finished dressing a single deer."</font>

55
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,390

loud enough so that I could hear.</font>

56
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... I didn't really care.</font>

57
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If somebody made fun of me for being an 
Ainu, I'd fight back as hard as I could.</font>

58
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if someone asked me for help, 
I'd help even if they were Japanese.</font>

59
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think about any of that stuff, 
but everyone else treated me as an Ainu.</font>

60
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember thinking that being 
an Ainu was a pain in the ass.</font>

61
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the pattern on my dad's makiri 
had been passed down for generations.</font>

62
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he probably wanted 
to make sure I knew it.</font>

63
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I went off to war, he started 
making me a makiri, I heard.</font>

64
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"If he has a real one," he'd said, "He 
can someday learn to make his own."</font>

65
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he died before he finished, I'm told.</font>

66
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,370

170
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,660

171
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She said that Attus kimonos, 
made with thread from tree bark,</font>

172
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">were so beautiful that 
no one could copy them.</font>

173
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Attus thread is dyed with Japanese 
alder sap that we call Kene.</font>

174
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's hard to do right. 
If you mess up, it turns brown.</font>

175
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the woman was obsessed 
with doing it right.</font>

176
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her threads were a more beautiful 
red than anyone had ever seen.</font>

177
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She used that thread to make a 
kimono for her beloved husband.</font>

178
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One day he wore it to go 
to work in the mountains.</font>

179
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the rain was strong that 
day, and he rushed home.</font>

180
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he realized that the area 
around his hips had turned brown.</font>

181
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He had an ax at his hip.</font>

182
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wouldn't happen with normal Attus.</font>

183
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They realized the rain had made the 
red sap bleed out from the kimono,</font>

184
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the part where it had 
touched the iron changed color.</font>

185
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her obsession had made it too delicate.</font>

186
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kadokura's skins got soaked and then 
touched the metal of that tank.</font>

187
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw that some of them turned 
black, and some didn't.</font>

188
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are several ways to tan leather.</font>

189
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sugimoto used alum, 
which is cheap and easy to get.</font>

190
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We use it as well.</font>

191
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But for softer, more expensive 
leather, you can use plant sap.</font>

192
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stachyurus praecox, for instance.
 Or Kene sap.</font>

193
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The taxidermist who made the false skins</font>

194
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">may have had his own obsession 
about tanning leather.</font>

195
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He may have made fakes that 
surpassed their originals.</font>

196
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it. The ones who didn't 
meet the condition were fakes.</font>

197
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,210

in with the ones Ipopte brought.</font>

198
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He mixed the real ones in with the fakes 
to stop us from cracking the code.</font>

199
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,870
