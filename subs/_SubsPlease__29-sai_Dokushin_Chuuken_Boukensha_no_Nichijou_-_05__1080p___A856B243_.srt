00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right! Off we go, dragon!</font>

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking after an animal sounds like 
a lot of work. Let's just eat it.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you even suggest 
that?! Absolutely not!</font>

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This egg is lucky! And it's going 
to hatch an incredible dragon!</font>

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure of it!</font>

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, if you say so.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hajime! It's all tiny!</font>

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

14
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Breakfast?</font>

15
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Is food the only 
thing on your mind, Hajime?!</font>

35
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dragon! It was a

36
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I found this dog who'd made

46
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's called a slime. They react 
to sound, so stay quiet, okay?</font>

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey! I said to be quiet, Dragon!</font>

51
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With how loud this thing chirps,
 I guess it's a bad match for slimes.</font>

71
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw! Dragon, you're not
 supposed to fall down!</font>

72
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,550

73
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if it's not useful, 
Hajime's gonna eat it!</font>

74
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe he did that at one point,
but he's a proper adventurer now!</font>

75
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd never do something
 like that, right, Hajime?</font>

76
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! You can do it, Dragon!</font>

77
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The trick is stability!</font>

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood!</font>

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,620

91
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Dragon," huh?</font>

92
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great. More crap.</font>

93
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait...</font>

94
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think this came from a rabbit bear.</font>

95
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're not supposed to be
 on this mountain.</font>

96
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if it builds a den here, 
that'll spell trouble.</font>

97
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, Rirui, we're gonna track it down.</font>

98
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try to stay close and...</font>

99
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels weird without her.</font>

100
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, we fold it once like this, 
 then again like so.</font>

101
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's how you do it.</font>

102
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see! Okay, let's do it, Dragon!</font>

103
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, just like that! Nicely done!</font>

104
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very good, Dragon!</font>

105
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

106
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dragon! What are you doing?!</font>

107
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine! We just need to wash it again.</font>

108
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A rabbit bear, you say?</font>

109
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but I couldn't track it down.</font>

110
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They breed quickly and attack people...</font>

111
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope we can deal with this
before they spread too much.</font>

112
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gotta wonder why it's come 
around these parts, though.</font>

113
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've had so many cold days,</font>

114
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's probably not as much 
to eat in the mountains.</font>

115
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it made the trek for food?</font>

117
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can the guild officially hire you to track
down and exterminate this rabbit bear?</font>

127

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm being c-c-c-c-carried...</font>

135
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See what happens when you push yourself?</font>

136
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, Dragon. Try and be more careful.</font>

137
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that Natalie's lunch?</font>

138
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

139
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui can take it to her!</font>

140
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah? Then you go right ahead.</font>

141
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mommy, am I doing a good 
job with cleaning?</font>

142
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you really are!</font>

143
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed, Natalie.</font>

144
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much for helping out.</font>

145
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna keep working hard!</font>

146
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really let your guard down 
when you get sick, I guess.</font>

147
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so lonely, Mommy!</font>

148
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

149
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long have you been there, Rirui?!</font>

150
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a while.</font>

151
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry that I'm not your 
mommy. You're lonely?</font>

152
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's not like that, Rirui!</font>

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mom... Er, my mother died three years ago,</font>

154
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I'm just feeling weak 
because of this cold, s-so...</font>

155
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know?</font>

156
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want me to give you head pats?</font>

157
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine, really!</font>

158
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want me to nurse you? 
I don't have milk, but...</font>

159
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's quite all right!</font>

160
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui, Dragon, thanks for today.</font>

161
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay! We want you to 
feel better soon, Natalie.</font>

162
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:50,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, pitching in helped me 
learn how hard your job is.</font>

163
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's rough at times, true,</font>

164
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I get to help out adventurers,
so it's also fun too.</font>

165
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help out adventurers?</font>

166
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I can really do for them is make 
sure they have a clean place to rest.</font>

167
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I want to be able
 to provide that every single day.</font>

168
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet you'll be a great wife, Natalie!</font>

169
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Where'd that come from?</font>

170
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

171
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not for Hajime.</font>

172
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't sound good.</font>

173
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna head out again tomorrow,</font>

174
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it might be faster to hire a beaster 
who's got a nose for tracking.</font>

175
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe so.</font>

176
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I gonna do?</font>

177
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it that hard to find a rabbit bear?</font>

178
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've spent a long time dungeon crawling.</font>

179
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't have much experience tracking 
down quarry out in nature.</font>

180
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There are things even 
Hajime can't do, huh?</i></font>

181
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What nice weather!</font>

182
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look better.</font>

183
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good morning, Hajime!</font>

184
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got some good rest thanks 
to Rirui and Dragon.</font>

185
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to hear it.</font>

186
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hajime!</font>

187
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going with you today!</font>

188
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm busy looking for the rabbit bear.</font>

189
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You oughta help Natalie again today.</font>

190
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui is supposed to be an adventurer 
and wants to do her job!</font>

191
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're both working hard!</font>

192
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Rirui can too!</font>

193
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just don't get in my way, okay?</font>

194
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that goes double for yakitori there.</font>

195
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not its name! 
It's Dragon, Hajime! Dragon!</font>

196
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good luck, adventurers!</font>

197
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're off!</font>

198
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These markings...</font>

199
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Might be a little too close
 to the ground for a rabbit bear.</font>

200
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Dragon! Where are you going?!</font>

201
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get back here! Dragon!</font>

202
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So noisy...</font>

203
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, Dragon!</font>

204
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly.</font>

205
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dragon?</font>

206
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a bunch of Dragons!</font>

207
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're sparrowfliers.</font>

208
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe they noticed one of their 
kind was around and came by?</font>

209
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, they're even noisier when grown!</font>

210
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Whoa there!</font>

211
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are you going, Dragon?!</font>

212
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

213
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it isn't the rabbit bear!</font>

214
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is this for real? Then was 
all that racket before was...</i></font>

215
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>something yakitori here did 
to track down the rabbit bear?</i></font>

216
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice work, Dragon!</font>

217
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now leave the rest to Rirui!</font>

218
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear!</font>

219
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's a job well done.</font>

220
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hajime, did Dragon help?</font>

221
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. A lot, actually.</font>

222
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are sparrowfliers 
all around these parts.</font>

223
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being able to get info from them 
is bound to come in handy.</font>

224
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hell, he might be more useful than you!</font>

225
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Rirui?</font>

226
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm good!</font>

227
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gotta work hard to be more 
helpful than Dragon!</font>

228
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here are your drinks!</font>

229
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never know when to keep 
your mouth shut, do you?</font>

230
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me. I'm looking for 
a woman named Veronica.</font>

231
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,370

232
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What brings you all the way out here?</font>

233
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something I needed 
to inform you of.</font>

234
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what might that be?</font>

235
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid your shop, Succubus Wings,</font>

236
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,010

237
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,680

238
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time we settle things, Veronica.</font>
