in the intersquad exhibition match.</font>

and be clipped from the bush?</font>

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Or will she bloom
where she's been planted?</font>

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Either way,</font>

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">we need to be in tip-top shape for
the fight against the Eight Thunder Gods</font>

from our household!</font>

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What a joyous occasion!</font>

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll take care of Himari.
Make her cry like when we were kids.</font>

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have no right to decide
who gets to kill her, Homare.</font>

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hard to take ya seriously when
you're dressed like a clown threw up!</font>

24
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maybe I'll just lop your head off next.</font>

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Except you can't.</font>

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,330

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,250

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We slayed plenty of Shuuki today,
and yet they still have so much energy.</font>

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's no room for weaklings
in the Azuma Family.</font>

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">My heart sunk and I no longer feel hope for the future</font>

32
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">It felt like time froze and now it's all over</font>

33
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Brooding and silent</font>

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">The umbrella of my heart began to open</font>

35
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Still, I kept my chin up and went on</font>

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">I won't ask you to comfort me</font>

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">I want to grow strong and focus on what's ahead</font>

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">But weakness crushes me</font>

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Meeting you is what filled my world with light</font>

40
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">I didn't have an ounce of hope, and yet I could laugh</font>

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Ordinary conversations always brought me a smile</font>

42
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">I won't say thanks 'cause you'll blush and laugh</font>

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">But I'm thinking it</font>

44
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Can I move forward from here?</font>

45
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">O light, come to me</font>

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="60">The Azuma Banquet</font>

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,960
<font size="40"><b>{\an7}Episode 5</b></font>

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mere steps from the Tamagawa Passage
lies the Azuma Estate.</font>

49
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just like old times, huh, Himari?</font>

50
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Knock it off.
I don't remember this place fondly.</font>

51
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If you're nervous,
why not hold your big sister's hand?</font>

52
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And get made fun of?</font>

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Glad you made it to the Azuma Banquet!</font>

54
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Lady Tovera?!</font>

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">When did she...</font>

56
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You are such a cutie pie, Yachiho!
The jewel of our family!</font>

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Snuggle, snuggle, snuggle!</font>

58
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Snuggle, snuggle, snuggle!</font>

59
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Lady Tovera!</font>

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Himari's here, too... Right there.</font>

61
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I see you still haven't quit
the Demon Defense Force.</font>

62
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are you disappointed?</font>

63
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">As long as you show promise,
we won't have an issue.</font>

64
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Otherwise, you'll be dealt with
before you sully the Azuma name.</font>

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You two are spoiling them,
coming to watch like this.</font>

66
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We've heard the banquet's quite ruthless.</font>

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They're our dear squad members.</font>

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We won't try anything funny.</font>

69
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's a competition, fair and square.</font>

70
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In that case, I'm not worried.</font>

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Himari's strong.</font>

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Commander...</font>

73
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh-ho...</font>

74
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This will also reflect on
Kyouka Uzen's character.</font>

75
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can gauge whether
she's a worthy ally to our family.</font>

76
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here, I brought a small token
of my appreciation.</font>

77
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">These are my favorite!</font>

78
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yummy!</font>

79
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Um, who is she?</font>

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Himari and Yachiho's grandmother.</font>

81
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just call me Tovera, kid!</font>

82
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I figured Fubuki would
sweep the competition this time around.</font>

83
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But if Yachiho's participating,
things could get interesting!</font>

84
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My goal is to prepare for the future.</font>

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah, sure. If you say so.</font>

86
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Anyways, everyone's here.</font>

87
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How many of each?</font>

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,750

92
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is going to get exciting!</font>

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are they all in the Demon Defense Force?</font>

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Only five out of the eight.</font>

95
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why did you answer that question?</font>

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Azuma Family has its fingers
in a lot of different pies.</font>

102
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,630

103
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,290

the next head of the family!</font>

104

to the finish in the other dimension.</font>

you're disqualified.</font>

becomes the new family matriarch!</font>

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Suffice to say...</font>

110
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's that?</font>

111
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The gate to the other dimension.</font>

112
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's not an Azuma alive

and ride the wave to victory.</font>

118
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,540

119
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,460

in this very courtyard?</font>

120
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm surprised you'd come back here
after all that trauma.</font>

then rewind time and bail Himari out.</font>

138
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We come to offer our ofuda</font>

139
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We're the last ones.</font>

140
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Good luck, Yuuki.</font>

141
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thanks!</font>

142
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It may be scary, but enter now</font>

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Pass on through</font>

144
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We're going to watch from the sidelines.</font>

145
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">When the fight begins,
it'll be displayed here.</font>

146
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, look. They wasted no time.</font>

147
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Unbelievable.</font>

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Announcing you'd be at the beach before
ever setting foot on the battlefield?</font>

149
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Our little stepsister's
awfully full of herself.</font>

150
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hunting you down
would only take time and effort.</font>

151
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're working as a team, am I right?</font>

152
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll take both of you on at once.</font>

153
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The main household
and its endless arrogance...</font>

154
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We have a strategy to deal with you.</font>

155
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We're going to seize the Azuma Family
for ourselves!</font>

156
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course I ended up on the far side.</font>

157
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gotta take Homare down
before she finds Himari!</font>

158
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow, it's like a real island.</font>

159
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't expect your wounds to heal
after combat in this dimension.</font>

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Be careful.</font>

161
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So it's totally different
than the intersquad match.</font>

162
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thanks for not complaining
about having to come with me.</font>

163
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What? It's a little late for that.</font>

164
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">As long as we're here,
let's kick some ass.</font>

165
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Make sure they feel it
when they get their just desserts!</font>

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sounds like you've got
the 7th Squadron spirit, Yuuki!</font>

167
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We've been training in preparation
for the Azuma Banquet.</font>

168
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll show them the fruits of our labor!</font>

169
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Although, some of it
was pretty embarrassing.</font>

170
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No! Focus, focus!</font>

171
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There you are.</font>

172
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Homare!</font>

173
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">After I tie you up and take you hostage...</font>

174
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll be free to finish off Yachiho.</font>

175
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not bad. I better kick it up a notch.</font>

176
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's Homare's program input!</font>

177
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Her ability just now...
Did she use it to track us down?</font>

178
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But why did she take off her uniform?</font>

179
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Because she's a nutjob!</font>

180
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've got sensitive skin,
so it lets me absorb a whole lotta data.</font>

181
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Homare's ability is known as "Python."</font>

182
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Her actions are programmed,
input into her brain...</font>

183
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">then her body executes
said movements to a T.</font>

184
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Though she cannot modify
the input actions,</font>

185
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">her body is significantly augmented
while executing them.</font>

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="60">Brand Break</font>

187
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All within the projected range.</font>

188
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

189
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She managed to evade my Brand Break?!</font>

190
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Her body's that much more enhanced
as a result of her program input.</font>

191
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Python...</font>

192
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's a tricky ability.</font>

193
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Data acquisition complete.</font>

194
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's checkmate in three turns.</font>

195
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's checkmate in three turns.</font>

196
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

197
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">First, I do damage to slow you down.</font>

198
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Two turns left.</font>

199
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's wrong, Himari?</font>

200
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gimme what ya got!</font>

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You don't stand a chance!</font>

202
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right...</font>

203
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If you insist, then who am I to refuse?</font>

204
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

205
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah, I should be good to go now!</font>

206
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll show her
just how extraordinary Slave can be!</font>

207
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Heavenward!</font>

208
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,080
<font size="40"><b>Heavenward</b></font>

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's game over.</font>

210
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not yet!</font>

211
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If Yumina can land the shot...</font>

212
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Their sniper has been taken care of.</font>

213
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I thought you had a strategy
to deal with me.</font>

214
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're wasting your time.</font>

215
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Even now, I'm getting stronger.</font>

216
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's been second to none
ever since we were young.</font>

217
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And she keeps getting better?</font>

218
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't... compete...</font>

219
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now we wait for Homare.</font>

220
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What was that?</font>

221
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So the little brat
had an ace up her sleeve.</font>

222
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,750
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Eternal Chains: Slave</b></font>

223
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,750
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Whirlwind "Heaven"</b></font>

224
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki must've recognized
his potential to evolve.</font>

225
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'd expect nothing less from my slave.</font>

226
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A massive buff for
a limited amount of time, I'm guessing?</font>

227
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I won't bother to explain.</font>

228
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You'll lose before you even catch on!</font>

229
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Looks like someone's all bark and no bite.</font>

230
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I keep my distance,
her buff will wear off soon enough.</font>

231
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's when I'll crush her!</font>

232
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wha-</font>

233
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We got her!</font>

234
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Good work!</font>

235
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, take it easy!
You're already worn out!</font>

236
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't need my ability.
I can fight with my bare hands!</font>

237
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You want a fight?</font>

238
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll give you one.</font>

239
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I warned you, didn't I?</font>

240
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That I'd kick your ass!</font>

241
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She took the bait!</font>

242
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I might be hurt,
but she can't beat me hand to hand.</font>

243
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I made you cry five times!
Let me jog your memory!</font>

244
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wh-what in the hell?!</font>

245
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Going hand to hand with the 7th Squadron?</font>

246
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are you stupid?</font>

247
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Quit lookin' down on me like that.</font>

248
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're part of the main household,
through and through!</font>

249
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm gonna take everything
from you pretentious pricks!</font>

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Azuma Family will be mine!</font>

251
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're angry at the Azumas.</font>

252
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Welcome to the club.</font>

253
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, be that as it may...</font>

254
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So strong...</font>

255
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">...it's time you got your just desserts!</font>

256
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well done, you two!</font>

257
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Talk about an upset! Nice job, Himari!</font>

258
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">"Heavenward"...</font>

259
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Marching for the heavens.</font>

260
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now it all makes sense.</font>

261
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Guess I oughtta go fetch the losers
while the combat's on pause.</font>

262
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please forgive me.</font>

263
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I couldn't stay in my Slave form.</font>

264
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's with the formality?</font>

265
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's just... you were amazing back there.</font>

266
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whatever.</font>

267
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Stick out your tongue.</font>

268
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is such an... indecent reward.</font>

269
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?!</font>

270
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Do go on.</font>

271
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Cipher, cipher</font>

272
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">One person sneaking a look at me</font>
