7
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's discuss what to do about the 
upcoming <i>True Showbiz Weekly</i> story.</font>

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, she's visibly down in the dumps.</font>

9
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who wouldn't be?</font>

10
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't believe our first romance scandal 
came from Senpai, our crazy cat lady.</font>

11
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was no romance involved!</font>

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And who cares 
if I become a crazy cat lady?</font>

13
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear nothing happened 
with Director Shima.</font>

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's true that we talked 
in a private apartment.</font>

15
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I stayed indoors all night with a man.</font>

16
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fans will be rightfully pissed.</font>

17
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

18
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to apologize to me.</font>

19
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you feel bad for these two, 
that's all I need.</font>

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know...</font>

21
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe getting photographed 
by a reporter makes you unprofessional.</font>

22
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These tabloid reporters 
will do anything for a scoop.</font>

23
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll try to manipulate you 
into getting careless</font>

24
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and use all sorts of barely legal tactics.</font>

25
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were a thorn in our side 
when Ai was around, too.</font>

26
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,090
<font size="24"><b>{\an8}<font face="Arial Black"><font color="#f8f3f2">True Showbiz Weekly</font></font></b></font>

28
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scoops on idols aren't even moneymakers, 
so publishers don't usually feature them.</font>

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

30
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not unless your group 
is big enough to perform on Kohaku.</font>

31
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-Komachi shouldn't be at the point 
where tabloids want dirt on you.</font>

32
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why?</font>

33
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look at this photo 
the publisher sent over.</font>

34
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was taken outside Director Shima's 
apartment building, see?</font>

35
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most entertainers bring dates home 
instead of going to love hotels.</font>

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the reporter was 
staking out the building.</font>

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, doesn't that mean...</font>

38
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The original target 
for this piece was Director Shima.</font>

39
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Considering even I've heard 
rumors that he's a playboy,</font>

40
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's probably gotten himself 
in quite a few messes.</font>

41
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm betting a woman he dumped 
tipped the reporter off.</font>

42
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just got caught up in the mess.</font>

43
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, so the leaker girl set her up!</font>

44
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be the natural assumption, yes.</font>

45
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ah...</i></font>

46
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was Mako.</i></font>

47
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An insider leak? Talk about ugly.</font>

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It happens all the time.</font>

49
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, in the future, stay clear 
of men likely to have a history.</font>

50
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now, make sure to be polite 
and respectful with the reporter.</font>

51
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those guys tend to write brutal articles 
about subjects who are hostile to them.</font>

52
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

53
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted an acting gig, so I was trying 
to get in his good graces.</font>

54
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got tunnel vision.</font>

55
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really sorry.</font>

56
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

57
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay.</font>

58
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We get it.</font>

59
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're just living our lives,</font>

60
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we can get depressed 
and stop thinking straight at times.</font>

61
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody's perfect 100% of the time.</font>

62
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay.</font>

63
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think happens to Senpai now?</font>

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will affect 
her future career for sure.</font>

65
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel so bad for her.</font>

66
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kana-chan's probably only being 
an idol for you, Aqu-tan.</font>

67
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She believed in and took this path 
because you asked her to.</font>

68
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She became an idol 
because that's what you wanted.</font>

69
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ruby.</font>

70
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if it meant making a terrible choice,
one that would bring you pain...</font>

71
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there was a way to help Arima,</font>

72
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would you want to?</font>

73
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you even have to ask?</font>

74
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's one of us.</font>

75
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

76
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

77
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could we bribe the reporter 
into burying the story?</font>

78
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too late for that.</font>

79
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't there some kind 
of trick we could use?</font>

80
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Technically, there is one way to stop it.</font>

81
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There is?</font>

82
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Major agencies use it sometimes,</font>

83
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's no way we could.</font>

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

85
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me! Tell me!</font>

86
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you'd need is...</font>

87
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,700
<font size="24"><b>{\an8}<font size="14"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#5e2519"></font></font></font></b>True Showbiz Weekly

89
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for asking to meet so late.</font>

90
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about it.</font>

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it boosts the value 
of my article, I can't complain.</font>

92
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I can still make 
the deadline at this point.</font>

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, according to your email,</font>

94
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you wanted to talk about Arima-san 
as a good friend with the same agency?</font>

95
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before that, could I confirm a few things?</font>

96
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead.</font>

97
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you not able to redact 
the name "Kana Arima"</font>

98
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and go with something like 
"Member A of a famous idol group"?</font>

99
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think so.</font>

100
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why's that?</font>

101
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the issue's top story.</font>

102
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arima-san is a grown woman 
who has name recognition—</font>

103
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a public figure 
with considerable influence.</font>

104
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no reason for the press 
to conceal her name.</font>

105
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arima's still in high school.</font>

106
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she's in showbiz.</font>

107
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She puts her name and face 
out there to do business.</font>

108
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's hardly fair for her to turn around 
and claim to be a private citizen now.</font>

109
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I disagree.</font>

110
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The stalkerish photos taken without her 
knowledge won't hold up to scrutiny.</font>

111
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you're free to hold that opinion.</font>

112
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this concerns two public figures—
Kana Arima-san and Director Shima.</font>

113
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're only reporting the fact 
that they went into an apartment together.</font>

114
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't a single word 
about what happened next.</font>

115
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's for the readers 
to judge for themselves.</font>

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if nothing happened, 
the readers will assume Arima is guilty.</font>

117
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't it hurt your conscience 
to saddle a high school kid with that?</font>

118
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does, but that comes with 
the territory of being a reporter.</font>

119
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may think we're a tabloid rag 
that runs worthless articles,</font>

120
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but our readers are the ones 
who want to know these things.</font>

121
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,390

122
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Compared to irresponsible 
posts on the internet,</font>

123
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}our stories hurt the subject less 
since we talk to them beforehand.</font>

124
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Most tabloids employ 
twenty to thirty writers.</i></font>

125
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're not assigned beats

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't do anything dangerous.</font>

248
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you say that?</font>

249
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why...</font>

250
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you here?</font>

251
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have work today.</font>

252
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you just got out of school, 
why aren't you in uniform?</font>

253
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean, 
"Don't do anything dangerous"?</font>

254
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're talking like you 
know what I'm doing.</font>

255
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are too smart 
for your own good.</font>

256
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aqua-kun... This isn't okay.</font>

257
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've crossed the line.</font>

258
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When did you start bugging me?</font>

259
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not long after <i>Love for Real</i>.</font>

260
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you might find 
a lead of some sort,</font>

261
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I wanted to track you if you 
made contact with the mastermind.</font>

262
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I made the right call back then.</font>

263
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought we were building 
a good relationship as equals.</font>

264
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I was wrong, wasn't I?</font>

265
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you trusted me more than this.</font>

266
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know about your situation.</font>

267
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always said I'd help you, haven't I?</font>

268
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd just asked me,</font>

269
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would've worn hundreds of these for you!</font>

270
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not an object or your sniffer dog! 
I'm a human being!</font>

271
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this shows that you 
don't see me as one!</font>

272
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd only asked, I would've gladly...</font>

273
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a lie.</font>

274
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akane, if you'd known about this,</font>

275
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you definitely would've done 
something to counter it.</font>

276
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This says it all.</font>

277
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You found information about my dad,</font>

278
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you were intending 
to settle things yourself.</font>

279
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't! I was just...</font>

280
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Explain this, then.</font>

281
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What exactly were you 
going to do with this?</font>

282
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was planning to talk to him.</font>

283
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just, anything could happen. 
He's a murderer and all.</font>

284
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was only going to use it 
as a last resort.</font>

285
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought it to protect myself—</font>

286
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akane.</font>

287
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay out of this.</font>

288
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll stop GPS tracking you.</font>

289
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'll get out of your life forever.</font>

290
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So stop putting yourself in danger.</font>

291
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say you were only using me, 
yet you're letting me down gently.</font>

292
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If only you'd asked me to go with you... 
I'd even follow you into hell.</font>

293
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would never take you there.</font>

294
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go on my own.</font>

295
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh... You've made up your mind, huh?</font>

296
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's just one thing 
I want to say to you.</font>

297
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You chose the wrong path, Aqua-kun.</font>

298
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trust me, I know.</font>

299
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's no stopping you anymore?</font>

300
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I couldn't save you.</font>

301
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care if it was arrogant of me.</font>

302
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted so badly to save you!</font>

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is for the best.</i></font>
