00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before the master of the house

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that, Diana left her room and went
 to the guest room on the second floor.</font>

8
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what Zisye... 
uh, wh-what the mirror showed.</font>

9
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mirror?</font>

10
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I rigged the mirrors so we'd know 
when someone passed in front of one.</font>

11
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As such, in order to get to

14
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'd be seen by the second-floor mirror

16
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Around that time, Kai climbed a ladder 
to meet Diana in the guest room.</font>

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The figure Heinz saw outside 
must have been Kai.</font>

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We also know the gardener didn't continue
into the house from the guest room.</font>

19
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mirror confirms that.</font>

21
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, Elise made her way 
from the kitchen to Father's room.</font>

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She got as far as the door before 
returning to the second-floor hallway.</font>

23
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She remembered he didn't want any water,</font>

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so she poured it into the vase of flowers.</font>

26
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By that time, my father had called for me,
 so I was on my way to the third floor.</font>

27
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I passed the second floor,</font>

28
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard Elise break the vase

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,910

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,280

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,660

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FLOOR MAP OF THE REINWEIß ESTATE

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then went to the third-floor storeroom 
to look for a replacement vase.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FLOOR MAP OF THE REINWEIß ESTATE

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Around the same time, 
Gordon left his room to go talk</font>

41
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">about meals with Heinz in the kitchen.</font>

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On the way, 
he saw Bernd in the dining room.</font>

43
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A short time after that, 
the guard headed to the master's room,</font>

44
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where he'd been summoned.</font>

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Elise took a vase down to the second floor,
 but the two didn't cross paths.</font>

47
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, Bernd used his spare key 
to enter Father's room.</font>

48
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He saw me unconscious 
next to the corpse and cried out.</font>

49
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only other people with spare keys 
are the old butler and the taller maid.</font>

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That pretty much it for what we know.</font>

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

53
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This maid visits the master's room 
to give him the water for his medicine.</font>

54
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She enters the room, knocks out 
Lynn Reinweiß when she comes to visit,</font>

55
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then shoves the master into the basement,
 where he falls to his death.</font>

56
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The storeroom next door holds weaponry.</font>

57
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wouldn't have been hard for her
 to remove the impostor's head.</font>

58
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impostor?</font>

59
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The headless corpse was not Father's.</font>

60
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His actual body was in the basement.</font>

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

62
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-Basement? But I never—</font>

63
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After the act, she locks the door and
 escapes to the storeroom via a route</font>

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">only someone of her size
 can squeeze through.</font>

65
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She crawls through the air vent.</font>

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's extremely narrow, but this petite maid
could have made it through.</font>

67
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That ignores one thing!</font>

68
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Elise could not have used the air vent.</font>

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I crawled through the air vent,
 it was dust paradise in there.</font>

70
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Elise had already crawled through it,
 there would've been much less dust.</font>

71
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are correct.</font>

72
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This maid is not the killer.</font>

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Elise!</font>

74
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss-tress Lynn!</font>

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a relief. I'm so glad.</font>

76
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am, too.</font>

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now it's your turn, Lynn Reinweiß.</font>

78
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the moment of confrontation.</font>

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to identify the killer?</font>

 of the crime to go to Father's room—</font>

82
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To get out of the kitchen, he'd have to 
go through the dining room or backyard,</font>

84
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,320

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Then, he goes through the backyard...</font>

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are guard dogs in the yard.</font>

87
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else do you have?</font>

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, that means Heinz
 isn't the killer, right?</font>

90
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you're just trying to use me

91
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd appreciate shrewder

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

93
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's what that was about.</font>

96
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,660

97
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hereby deduce you were accomplices.</font>

98
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they'd found a way

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they could've easily done it.</font>

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the gardener doesn't enter

101
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he must use the ladder to get in.</font>

102
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ladder may only just 
reach the second floor,</font>

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if he pulls it up with him once there,</font>

104
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he has access to the third floor as well.</font>

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, but isn't it too heavy for that?</font>

106
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can't lift it alone,</font>

107
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the maid is there,
waiting in the guest room.</font>

108
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So they pull it up together,</font>

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then the gardener climbs up
 to the third floor.</font>

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, he scrambles onto the roof 
and heads to the master's room.</font>

111
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The maid goes to 
the master to distract him.</font>

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meanwhile, the gardener 
enters from the balcony,</font>

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and they commit the crime together.</font>

114
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The gardener could then take 
the head and weapons outside,</font>

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while the maid locks the door
 with her spare key.</font>

116
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Clearly, these two are the killers.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

122
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Diana has an extreme fear of heights.</font>

123
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She could never go out onto a balcony.</font>

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As they didn't leave the guest room,

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which one do you want to take?</font>

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like you've already chosen 
the one you think isn't the killer.</font>

132
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, so whoever 
she <i>doesn't</i> pick is the killer?</font>

133
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll pick me then, won't you?</font>

134
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not the killer!</font>

135
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop being so disrespectful.</font>

136
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who gives a damn about respect now?</font>

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gordon!</font>

138
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bernd, yeah. Pick Bernd.</font>

139
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bernd. Bernd.</font>

140
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I choose...</font>

141
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gordon.</font>

142
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

143
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? How would he get from his room 
on the first floor to the master's room?</font>

144
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

145
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means it's impossible 
for him to have done it.</font>

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ergo...</font>

147
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What the hell?
I'm the security guard here!</font>

148
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Why would I want to kill—</font>

149
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}SUSPECT: THE GUARD, BERND</font>

150
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh?</font>

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No! I'm not the killer!</font>

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mister Bernd?</font>

153
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why?</font>

154
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it.</font>

155
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So it was you.</font>

156
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! This doesn't make any sense!</font>

157
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Bernd really the killer?</font>

158
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not.</font>

159
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

160
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, guard.</font>

161
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care what you say. I'm not the—</font>

162
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm. It's even worse than I heard.</font>

163
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! Bernd faints at the sight of blood!</font>

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The accomplice cut off the corpse's head,</font>

165
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and attacked you in the bath.</font>

166
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That'd be impossible for him.</font>

167
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We carried out this investigation 
under unusual circumstances.</font>

168
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We had access to information 
we normally wouldn't,</font>

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and ended up relying on it too much.</font>

170
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mirror?</font>

171
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean Zisye's information 
about everyone's whereabouts?</font>

172
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't figured it out yet?</font>

173
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

174
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, fine.</font>

175
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm sure <i>you</i> noticed 
something. Right, Zisye?</font>

176
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What do you mean?</font>

177
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was doing everything I could to help.</font>

178
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm, I wonder.</font>

179
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They didn't escape through the air vent.
They can't work in high places.</font>

180
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were observed by witnesses,</font>

181
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or they pass out at 
the merest sight of blood.</font>

182
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we disregard the alibi 
created by the mirrors,</font>

183
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's one individual who could 
have moved around freely.</font>

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you can't just disregard 
an alibi, can you?</font>

185
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't... as it applies to <i>humans</i>.</font>

186
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

187
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that can't be right!</font>

188
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zisye, you saw him, didn't you?</font>

189
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, he's been the butler here forever!</font>

190
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Butler?</font>

191
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's the tall maid and the small maid,</font>

193
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the gardener, the guard, and the cook.</font>

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are the five servants 
who work here at the mansion, right?</font>

195
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, Lynn, there's something 
I've been wondering about this whole time.</font>

196
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is this "Gordon"?</font>

197
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I reveal the truth now?</font>

198
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I will.</font>

199
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne and I have deduced</font>

200
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the murder would've been impossible 
for any human in the mansion to commit.</font>

201
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But allowing mirrors to serve as alibis 
presumes that the culprit is human.</font>

202
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a vampire, aren't you...</font>

203
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gordon?</font>

204
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please, Gramps. Will you read to me?</i></font>

205
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is the third one, Mistress.</i></font>

206
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't care. Keep reading 
to me until I get sleepy.</i></font>

207
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I suppose I cannot refuse.</i></font>

208
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hurray! I love you, Gramps!</i></font>

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You believe <i>I</i> am a vampire?</font>

210
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is not the time for jest.</font>

211
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, please stand in front of the mirror.</font>

212
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're not a vampire, 
you should have a reflection.</font>

213
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Miss Lynn, Gordon and I 
were both assaulted by the killer.</font>

214
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the one who assaulted you.</font>

215
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

216
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I never touched the old man.</font>

217
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He probably played the victim for show.</font>

218
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was one thing that bothered me.</font>

219
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So the broken vase was 
your doing after all, Elise?</i></font>

220
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you hadn't been up 
to the third floor, Gordon,</font>

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when did you see the broken vase?</font>

222
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a shame. I was hoping
 to play this out to the end.</font>

223
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there was no point in watching 
the mansion through mirrors at all.</font>

224
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were in Father's room 
the whole time, weren't you?</font>

225
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After you knocked me out, 
you killed Father</font>

226
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and walked back to your room,</font>

227
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">passing in front of the mirrors.</font>

228
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why did you kill Father?</font>

229
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am still very fond of you all even now.</font>

230
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had hoped to enjoy serving this house 
and living secretly amid humans.</font>

231
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, perhaps about a month ago,</font>

232
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the master acquired a certain item 
in a black market auction.</font>

233
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the heart of Lord Nachzehrer, 
the one king I truly serve.</font>

234
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The master and I had finished 
gathering the necessary bodies.</font>

235
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only thing left was to perform
 the reanimation ritual.</font>

236
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I preferred to revive Lord 
Nachzehrer rather than the mistress.</font>

237
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is why I did it.</font>

238
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But fear not, for I was able 
to grant the master's wish</font>

240
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and reunite him with his wife</font>

241
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as pieces of Lord Nachzehrer's unholy body.</font>

242
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. That's why you left 
another body in the master's room.</font>

243
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With my king revived and the master 
and his wife living on within his body,</font>

244
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and with Lynn serving as 
a worthy mistress in her own right,</font>

245
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wished to continue 
residing in this mansion.</font>

246
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Mistress"? Don't make me laugh. 
You wanted to control her like a puppet.</font>

247
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw the bite mark on her arm.</font>

248
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:49,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A noble title would have helped 
facilitate Nachzehrer's return to power.</font>

249
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must have been part of 
the reason you killed the master.</font>

250
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You intended to manipulate Lynn Reinweiß
 to take over the mansion.</font>

251
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well played, Lord Arne Neuntöte.</font>

252
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, so you know me?</font>

253
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never expected the mistress 
to have already been bled.</font>

254
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No wonder she wouldn't 
follow my orders, let alone die.</font>

255
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It appears she was already not human.</font>

256
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I still hadn't... not yet...</font>

257
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet I never expected 
any of this to happen,</font>

258
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">including her calling the police.</font>

259
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's why you attempted 
to murder Lynn Reinweiß.</font>

260
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the master hadn't called Bernd 
and started all of this commotion,</font>

261
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would have already succeeded 
in reviving my lord.</font>

262
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now? None of that matters.</font>

263
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose you didn't need 
a weapon with arms like that.</font>

264
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use every part of me.</font>

265
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right here, right now. 
All hail Lord Nachzehrer!</font>

266
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back, baby!</font>

267
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, I haven't had a body in a while.</font>

268
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can ya even imagine how it feels 
to end up inside some old geezer?</font>

269
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can ya, Neuntöte?</font>

270
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, did I scare you speechless?</font>

271
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course you look exactly 
as stupid as you sound.</font>

272
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You were dumb enough for me
 to get that heart out of you.</font>

273
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So who's the stupid one?</font>

274
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you suggest we two vampires 
settle our differences?</font>

275
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. A blood duel.</font>

276
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. The blood you lose during 
a blood duel goes to your opponent.</font>

277
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna slurp up all that blood of yours
 and become Neuntöte myself.</font>

278
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting.</font>

279
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! Now, let's see who devours who!</font>

280
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might wanna try paying attention!</font>

281
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How reckless. Are you planning 
to use up all of your blood?</font>

282
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I take all of yours, it won't matter.</font>

283
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get him!</font>

284
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose that's what 
you call a death wish.</font>

285
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How delightful.</font>

286
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Damn you.</font>

287
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I win.</font>

288
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

289
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and me each have one heart.</font>

290
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could I lose?</font>

291
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You fight far too inefficiently.</font>

292
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, no kidding.</font>

293
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still refuse to yield?</font>

294
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ain't gonna get me 
to roll over that easy!</font>

295
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be taking that heart back now.</font>

296
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You piece of shit.</font>

297
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?</font>

298
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Lord Arne. I'm glad you're safe.</font>

299
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, is Gordon...</font>

300
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's dead.</font>

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened to the other servants?</font>

304
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told them to get to safety.</font>

309
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at that.</font>

310
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The shining moon makes 
everything look so beautiful.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you an idiot?</font>

319
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}And that is essentially all this is.</font>
