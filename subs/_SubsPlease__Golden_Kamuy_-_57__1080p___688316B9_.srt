"steal Yuusaku-san's virginity."</font>

54
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,650

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's an unwritten rule that regimental 
flag bearers have to be virgins.</font>

56
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the hope is that she 
can steal his virginity,</font>

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hopefully get pregnant 
and force a marriage,</font>

58
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and pull him out of the military 
and into the zaibatsu.</font>

59
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Commander Hanazawa found 
out what his wife is up to.</font>

60
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's far away in Hokkaido,</font>

61
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so he asked the 1st Division Commander, 
a man he can trust, for help.</font>

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now he's asked me to deal with it.</font>

63
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need to go 
through all those hoops.</font>

64
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His wife's right next to him. 
She can just talk to him.</font>

65
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ideally, yes.</font>

66
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she's already crossed the line 
and involved other people in this.</font>

67
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This could turn into a problem 
that affects the morale of</font>

68
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the whole 7th Division.</font>

69
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The wife of their Division Commander</font>

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is doing something that could 
be seen as treason, after all.</font>

71
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, much better!</font>

72

74
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,820

at the academy you could ask.</font>

75
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why me?</font>

76

77
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,180

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried to pretend to be someone boring.</font>

133
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good, good. Excellent work, Norabo.</font>

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arranged marriages like this one involve 
at least two or three meetings.</font>

135
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So get ready for the next one.</font>

136
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was so quiet. He just nodded 
and never corrected me.</font>

137
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really liked him!</font>

138
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And more than anything...</font>

139
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was hot!</font>

140
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do prefer good-looking men.</font>

141
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why you're not married yet.</font>

142
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't imagine marrying someone 
you've only met a few times.</font>

143
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how it works. 
Particularly for the upper classes.</font>

144
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure everybody would 
rather marry someone they liked,</font>

145
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they don't get a choice.</font>

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

147
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have friends back home 
named Ume-chan and Toraji.</font>

148
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was supposed to marry Ume-chan.</font>

149
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But someone in my family got tuberculosis.</font>

150
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then everyone in 
my family died from it.</font>

151
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to kill you, Ume-chan!</font>

152
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said that if two years 
passed and I didn't get sick,</font>

153
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd go back to the village.</font>

154
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That I'd come for her.</font>

155
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She married Toraji.</font>

156
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd loved Ume-chan since they were young.</font>

157
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

158
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you come back?</font>

159
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She still cares about you...</font>

160
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she's my wife anyway!</font>

161
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations on your marriage, Toraji.</font>

162
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said she still cared about me.</font>

163
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she married him anyway.</font>

164
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe that's just how it works, too.</font>

165
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you trying to say that she 
gave in and married Toraji,</font>

166
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you don't know if she's really happy?</font>

167
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the fuck do you know about 
Ume-chan, you little brat?!</font>

168
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, uh...</font>

169
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get so damn cocky just because 
you're kind of handsome, you fucking kid!</font>

170
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gah, you're pissing me off!</font>

171
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're really arrogant enough to 
think she loves you most forever?</font>

172
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't give her so little credit!</font>

173
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is it worth getting that mad over?</i></font>

174
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's rude to both of them!</font>

175
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What direction is your village, Norabo?</font>

176
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Face it and apologize, damn it!</font>

177
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I just hanging on to 
it too long, you think?</font>

178
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's fine.</font>

179
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

180
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Men are pathetic creatures.</font>

181
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay to keep the woman 
you love deep in your heart,</font>

182
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and remember her once in a while.</font>

183
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why if you're a man, 
you should understand Toraji's fears.</font>

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget your home and both of them.</font>

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,350

188
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,680

189
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Men are easy. Just make it 
look like you'll fuck them.</font>

190
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,530

191
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wrap your legs around them 
and make them scream.</font>

192
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuusaku-san's from an important family,</font>

193
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and men choose based on looks, right?</font>

194
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'll do the same thing!</font>

195
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My cousin says I put too 
much importance on looks.</font>

196
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,110

and he seems happy.</font>

to be a flag-bearer, anyway?</font>

202
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe he wants to eat</font>

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">fried shrimp at the Imperial Hotel 
instead of going into the army.</font>

208
