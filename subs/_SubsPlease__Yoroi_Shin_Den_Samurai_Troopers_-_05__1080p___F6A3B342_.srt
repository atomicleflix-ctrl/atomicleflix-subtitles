00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has it been three years?</font>

2
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion! Fall back for now!</font>

3
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you nuts?!</font>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You expect me to abandon them?!</font>

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei!</font>

6
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei! The demons are attacking!</font>

7
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to <i>recruit</i> that demon?</font>

8
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's human. And the jewel glowed red.</font>

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then he must be...</font>

10
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't be serious about 
making Gai a Samurai Trooper.</font>

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am.</font>

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With proper guidance, he'll be 
an emissary of Fire like Mr. Sanada.</font>

13
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think, anyway.</font>

14
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}QUESTION 8: A PERSON CUTS AHEAD
OF YOU IN LINE. IS IT OKAY TO HIT THEM?</font>

15
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand!
 I just don't get humans!</font>

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take it easy.</font>

17
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this song?</font>

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's getting me all fired up!</font>

19
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's called "Samurai Heart."</font>

21
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been meaning to ask. 
What're those marks on your shoulders?</font>

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, these? I inherited them from my 
role model, the Trooper of Fire.</font>

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire is more my thing, though.</font>

25
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you become worthy of being
 a hero, they'll appear on you.</font>

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm... fine...</font>

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In what universe?</font>

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can barely even stand.</font>

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we win, you quit being 
a Samurai Trooper.</font>

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't need an old fart slowing us down!</font>

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those sound like fighting words.</font>

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei?</font>

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei!</font>

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They got me.</font>

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those stupid brats!</font>

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like that.</font>

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is their way of showing kindness.</font>

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are they now?</font>

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fighting demons with Shion.</font>

40
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samurai Troopers can't unleash their 
full power unless all five stand together.</font>

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if he's with them...</font>

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dad!</font>

43
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean that's...</font>

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Demon Emperor...</font>

45
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ramaga!</font>

SADNESS</font>

47
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To think that my own child 
would betray me!</font>

48
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't give me that crap! 
You only see me as your next Puppet!</font>

49
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is a son's duty
 to sacrifice himself for his father.</font>

50
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's that mindset that
rubs me the wrong way!</font>

51
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Why'd it go <i>boom</i>?</font>

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was that Ramaga's sorcery, or what?</font>

53
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong? If you won't come to me,</font>

54
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll reach you.</font>

55
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it! Hypnosis?</font>

56
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guys! Wake the hell up!</font>

57
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't you kill them?</font>

58
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did losing your power reduce you 
to human on the inside as well?</font>

59
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. Your stupid faces are 
pissing me off even more than usual.</font>

60
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This fight is over.</font>

61
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anti-Magic Bullet!</font>

62
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the...?</font>

63
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened to us?</font>

64
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei...</font>

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, who's ready to strike back?</font>

66
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei, you idiot!</font>

67
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're already way past 
your limit, so why push it?</font>

68
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because he promised Ryo.</font>

69
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryo? From the original Samurai Troopers?</font>

70
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryo Sanada, the emissary of Fire.</font>

71
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He passed the baton to Ryusei.</font>

72
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Ryusei's element is Light. 
Why would the emissary of Fire choose him?</font>

73
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think that Ryo sensed 
something in Ryusei.</font>

74
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so he entrusted the future
of the Samurai Troopers to him.</font>

75
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei has been sacrificing himself 
to live up to his expectations.</font>

76
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can that man dispel a supreme art?</font>

77
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could it be...</font>

78
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess old men really do get up early.</font>

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so worried about my problem 
students, I couldn't sleep.</font>

80
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you break the spell on us?</font>

81
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It was a gamble, 
so I'm glad it paid off.</font>

82
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I wasn't affected
 anyway, but yeah.</font>

83
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were totally under their control. 
Probably the worst of anyone.</font>

84
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you say?!</font>

85
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you attack us 
when we came at you?</font>

86
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurting you guys would 
only weaken our side.</font>

87
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still a terrible liar.</font>

88
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're still a pain in the ass!</font>

89
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, if anyone's a pain 
in the ass, it's you!</font>

90
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you've got a point.</font>

91
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

92
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Enough with the chitchat!</font>

93
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run!</font>

94
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you tell me about the poison?</font>

95
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not good with words.</font>

96
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bull. You're in no shape to fight.</font>

97
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not fooling anyone.</font>

98
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love the Samurai Troopers, same as you.</font>

99
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a dig? Are you being sarcastic?</font>

100
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I'm jealous.</font>

101
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't this seem weird to you?</font>

102
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

103
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He ought to know 
we can dodge at this range.</font>

104
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that you mention it, 
this isn't like him.</font>

105
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sasuke normally goes for a head-on fight.</font>

106
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's it!</font>

107
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamato! Use your secret art!</font>

108
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

109
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like that?! Easy for you to say!</font>

110
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}JUSTICE</font>

111
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Secret Art: Geo Morph!</font>

112
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! That's the first time it worked!</font>

113
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So that's what 
the invisible walls really are.</font>

114
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Are you gonna just ignore
 my debut secret art?!</font>

115
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saved your butts! The least you
 could do is say thank you!</font>

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

117
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice one.</font>

118
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Props.</font>

119
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want proper thank-yous!
And Gai, all you did was nod!</font>

120
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better not think 
that wall will save you!</font>

121
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

122
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like Kaito's right.</font>

123
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're strangely determined 
not to get out of position.</font>

124
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Explosive Thunder Attack!</font>

125
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now!</font>

126
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, man. All because 
Sasuke's crew got out of position.</font>

127
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the Ten Warriors really were behind it.</font>

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I call it "Operation Move the Ten Warriors
 and Bust Through the Barrier"!</font>

129
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done. But the true 
battle is yet to come.</font>

130
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anti-Magic Bullet!</font>

131
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this!</font>

132
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you imagine your 
petty tricks would fool me?!</font>

133
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I didn't!</font>

134
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When did he—</font>

135
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the end!</font>

136
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think again!</font>

137
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You call this dull knife 
the Sword of Domination?</font>

138
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make me laugh!</font>

139
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion!</font>

140
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion said the Jewel of Conquest and Sword
 of Domination were "Sacred Treasures."</font>

141
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. When the Three Sacred 
Treasures are assembled,</font>

142
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Armor of the Supreme Emperor 
is supposed to appear.</font>

143
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The what?</font>

144
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A legendary set of armor only 
the Samurai Troopers can manifest,</font>

145
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">said to banish any evil.</font>

146
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So does this mean Ramaga's invading
 to stop them from summoning said armor?</font>

147
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose...</font>

148
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ridiculous.</font>

149
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To think you dared face me 
with such a paltry imitation...</font>

150
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you mean he tried to open 
the Demon Gate with a fake?!</font>

151
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most likely, he never 
intended to open it at all.</font>

152
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He lured us out here by brandishing 
the Sword of Domination as bait.</font>

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent.</font>

154
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't sure I could protect 
the Sword of Domination on my own.</font>

155
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is the true sword?</font>

156
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know I won't give it up that easily.</font>

157
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bold words.</font>

158
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, listen up.</font>

159
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it?</font>

160
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samurai Troopers, 
I shall now bestow unto you...</font>

161
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">despair.</font>

162
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei!</font>

163
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryu!</font>

164
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The demon who struck you 
with that poison three years ago</font>

165
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was me.</font>

166
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei!</font>

167
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just shut up and go!</font>

168
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That poison does not end life.</font>

169
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It magnifies hatred, making 
its victim a hideous monstrosity.</font>

170
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like hell... I'd give in... 
to this crap...!</font>

171
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be the next leader 
of the Samurai Troopers.</font>

172
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why me? I don't even wield fire.</font>

173
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I sense the spirit 
of Righteousness in you.</font>

174
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't this...</font>

175
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The crest of fire. 
I'm entrusting it to you.</font>

176
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't let myself... lose here!</font>

177
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei!</font>

178
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such is the fate of all humans 
ruled by negativity.</font>

179
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Savor it for yourself.</font>

180
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your fault!</font>

181
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I hadn't saved you, 
I never would have ended up like this!</font>

182
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it, Ryu!</font>

183
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How would you know how I feel?!</font>

184
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My isolation!</font>

185
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My rage!</font>

186
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My despair!</font>

187
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryusei...</font>

188
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll wreck everything.</font>

189
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll wreck... I'll...</font>

190
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guys...</font>

191
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill me!</font>

192
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you nuts?! There's no way!</font>

193
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There must be a way to save him.</font>

194
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what can we do?</font>

195
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll wreck everything 
if you leave me this way.</font>

196
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please... kill me...</font>

197
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll...</font>

198
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">put you out of your misery!</font>

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gai!</font>

200
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this song?</font>

201
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's getting me all fired up!</font>

202
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

203
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's called "Samurai Heart."</font>

204
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The heart of a samurai, huh?</font>

205
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe learning this song will 
make me a little more human.</font>

206
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?</font>

207
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyone can see you're already human.</font>

208
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell?</font>

209
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Gai seriously gonna just—</font>

210
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. He's not thinking of killing him.</font>

211
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can you be so sure?</font>

212
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After spending a month with him, 
even a monkey could tell.</font>

213
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A <i>monkey</i>?!</font>

214
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you become worthy of being
 a hero, they'll appear on you.</font>

215
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that'll never happen.</font>

216
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I killed a whole bunch 
of humans, remember?</font>

217
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you regret it?</font>

218
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, you've done things 
you can never take back.</font>

219
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you'll have to atone by doing 
something only you can do. By fighting.</font>

220
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you can become an emissary of Fire</font>

221
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with the spirit of Righteousness.</font>

222
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What even is 
"the spirit of Righteousness"?</font>

223
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll learn soon enough.</font>

224
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys...</font>

225
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm no monkey!</font>

226
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

227
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think Yama's trying to say 
you ought to lean on us more.</font>

228
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you need us to do?</font>

229
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pin him down for me.</font>

230
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will that save Ryu?</font>

231
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows?
But it's his only chance right now.</font>

232
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Couldn't you put more thought into—</font>

233
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

234
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

235
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Count me in.</font>

236
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Listen, you—</font>

237
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, all right!</font>

238
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't need a samurai 
who's not ready to fight.</font>

239
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've found some will to fight since then.</font>

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,040

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,960

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Wake up, Ryu!</font>

263
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?!</font>

267
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sword rapidly activates it,</font>

268
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,950
