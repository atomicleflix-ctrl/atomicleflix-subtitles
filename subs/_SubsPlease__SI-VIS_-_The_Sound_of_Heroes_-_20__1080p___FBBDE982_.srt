<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FUTURE AFTER REVENGE</font>

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FUTURE AFTER REVENGE
- Am I... alive?</font>

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya?</font>

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Siren!</font>

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were found near
Shinjuku, which disappeared.</font>

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah.</font>

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You charged into the Mirage, didn't you?</font>

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To try and fight it on your own.</font>

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like I'm alive, somehow.</font>

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you do something so dangerous?!</font>

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way you can
stop the Mirage like this!</font>

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you understand
the condition you're in?!</font>

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A calling arises from deep</i>
<i>within in my burning heart</i></font>

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's Show Time</i></font>

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The price of living in the time of freedom</i></font>

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"So, what do you want to do?"</i></font>

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just standing there with my empty body</i></font>

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Like a calling to protect the world</i></font>

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I craved an unequaled gift</i></font>

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lost in night's darkness</i></font>

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Until a voice called out to me</i></font>

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Like the light that declares the dawn</i></font>

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll take you with me at</i>
<i>any cost (I pray and wish)</i></font>

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just being with you makes me strong</i></font>

25
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's not an exaggeration</i></font>

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That encounter was a supernova</i>
<i>(Our eyes were locked)</i></font>

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Will be changed forever (Just to be)</i></font>

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Destiny is Calling us now</i></font>

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just to be who we are</i></font>

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Destiny is Calling us now</i></font>

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just to be by your side</i></font>

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we're connected
to servers around the world.</font>

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All that's left to do is to upload
the information from Metis, right?</font>

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tears of Idea are forming
all around the world right now.</font>

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything that has disappeared from
this world as if they never existed...</font>

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The information on it will spill out
from those tears and flood the world.</font>

38
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now it's all up to how people
will handle that information.</font>

39
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Believe it and cause panic</font>

40
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or laugh it off as a conspiracy
theory and get invaded.</font>

41
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be hell either way.</font>

42
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't get
any more exciting than this.</font>

43
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we... Are we really sure
we can trust Medea-san?</font>

44
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We followed her judgment,
and we almost lost Siren-san.</font>

45
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She threw herself into the Mirage,
knowing what it really was.</font>

46
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that not called "suicide"
in the language of Earth?</font>

47
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That idiot has shined so brightly at
the core of the Mirage many times before!</font>

48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her song has saved the world
no matter how bleak the situation was!</font>

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until Lukos beat her, that is.</font>

50
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should have protected her.</font>

51
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't have given her free rein
because of her past power.</font>

52
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I understand that what happened
might have damaged your trust in me.</font>

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you do not wish for this,
then let us stop this plan.</font>

54
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll move forward with the plan.</font>

55
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world will be united,
even if it causes an unprecedented panic.</font>

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything's changed overnight.</font>

57
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're getting backlash
from all over the world.</font>

58
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish our world debut
had been more positive.</font>

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is what it is, for now.</font>

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cruel truth like this is hard to accept.</font>

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But as Medea-san predicted,
the tears are starting to form.</font>

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I saw it!</i></font>

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My town, my family, it all disappeared!</i></font>

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right in front of my eyes!</i></font>

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That footage from Japan wasn't fake!</i></font>

66
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's come to the world of nightmares, too.</font>

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From this moment, everyone on Earth
will have to choose how to face XENOS.</font>

68
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yo.</font>

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Long time no see.</font>

70
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya-kun? Soji-kun?</font>

71
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you get in?!</font>

72
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Press must have been staking out outside!</font>

73
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know how to handle the press.</font>

74
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As such, we will leave Earth
and head to the XENOS stronghold.</font>

75
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll kick their asses with our
performance and snap them out of it!</font>

76
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know if we'll come back alive.</font>

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This may be the last
conversation we'll have.</font>

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I will... SI-VIS is...</font>

79
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Haven't you learned to relax?</font>

80
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sound like a committee chair.</font>

81
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or worse, a teacher.</font>

82
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See how everyone's put off?</font>

84
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This dead air is your fault!</font>

85
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What?</font>

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, right?</font>

87
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He insisted that he do the talking,
so I let him, and this is what we got.</font>

88
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your words are too emotional
and baseless!</font>

89
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A cross between you and
I would be perfect.</font>

91
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you finish the speech.</font>

92
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

93
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So... this is goodbye for a while.</font>

94
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been putting our lives on the line.</font>

95
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">While I enjoyed it, I was scared, too.</font>

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I think I just need to do
this tour like all the other ones.</font>

97
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I still feel I'll be crushed
by fear I've never felt before.</font>

98
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because the person I love, the people
I love, count on me to protect them.</font>

99
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's not all.</font>

100
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to save those I've yet to meet.</font>

101
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because Medea-san showed me...</font>

102
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What Yosuke-kun was trying to do.</font>

103
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His big wish for the people of Earth.</font>

104
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone singing, dancing,
and laughing together.</font>

105
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The future where earthlings
and XENOS get along with each other.</font>

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The future Yosuke-kun dreamed of.</font>

107
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't give up on them until the end.</font>

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see.</i></font>

109
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This Yosuke-kun must be
very special to you, Kyoya.</font>

110
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

111
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I have to go, Grammy.</font>

112
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kenji, Yoshikazu, and Satomi!</font>

113
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You know, it may be cold over there.</i></font>

114
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Don't forget to bring your sweater.</i></font>

115
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Okay.</font>

116
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you worry, Grandma.</font>

117
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make sure that he does.</font>

118
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm counting on you, Soji-kun.</i></font>

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That boy always sleeps with his tummy out.</i></font>

120
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm hanging up, Grammy!</font>

121
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, guys. You can go ahead.</font>

122
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THIS IS NAGI'S MASTERPIECE!
WRITE SOME AWESOME MUSIC FOR IT!</font>

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ready to go, Kyoya?</font>

124
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Siren.</font>

125
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's show XENOS how awesome
SI-VIS's performances are.</font>

126
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Siren.</font>

127
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when Nagi comes back, we can all—</font>

128
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Siren!</font>

129
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember what Medea-san said?</font>

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Idea can't be returned
to normal with human power.</font>

131
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a strong curse XENOS cast
in exchange for your life.</font>

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't work on me.</font>

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't like this.</font>

134
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't leave me here.</font>

135
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't leave you!</font>

136
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll reconcile with XENOS, ask them how
to turn you back to normal, and come back.</font>

137
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please wait until then.</font>

138
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Root for us from here.</font>

139
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know how cruel that is?</font>

140
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was born only to sing, nothing else.</font>

141
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't born to envy
other people singing.</font>

142
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care if I disappear.</font>

143
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This can be the end of me.</font>

144
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still want to—</font>

145
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

146
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want a world without you!</font>

147
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm doing this to protect
the world you're in!</font>

148
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, Nagi, everyone in SI-VIS, everyone
at Harmonia, my friends and family...</font>

149
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going, so I can protect this world
where people I love live!</font>

150
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate that.</font>

151
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But no matter what happens to me
or what results we get, I will sing.</font>

152
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one can stop my song.</font>

153
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

154
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to hear your song...</font>

155
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">one more time, too.</font>

156
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring Nagi back no
matter what, you hear me?</font>

157
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the case, Vice President.</font>

158
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that can be your good
luck charm, it's no big deal.</font>

159
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come back alive.</font>

160
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will!</font>

161
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it summer the last time
we came to Tatekashi island?</font>

162
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels like it was such a long time ago.</font>

163
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, a lot has happened since then.</font>

164
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This island is connected
to the planet of XENOS?</font>

165
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When Orphe escaped to Earth, he used
Metis to connect this place to XENOS.</font>

166
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like that one door
that goes anywhere.</font>

167
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the power Lord Archon gave us
to have Earth in our hands.</font>

168
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orphe used it in a completely
opposite way.</font>

169
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samael sealed the gate
I created, but here...</font>

170
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This gate allows one
to supply Idea remotely.</font>

171
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you leave this planet.</font>

172
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, it won't be as strong as
your live concerts, so do be careful.</font>

173
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This road leads to the planet of XENOS.</font>

174
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There may only be a few of us left,</font>

175
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but Apollo, who defeated you alone,
awaits at the end.</font>

176
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you still—</font>

177
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course we'll go.</font>

178
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's what you, other XENOS,
and most importantly,</font>

179
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yosuke-kun set out
to achieve more than ten years ago.</font>

180
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, follow me.</font>

181
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think I'll just let you go like that?</font>

182
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Krios.</font>

183
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been a while, June.</font>

184
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to our planet, aren't you?</font>

185
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to destroy us
before we take Earth from you.</font>

186
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Krios, listen to me. We are—</font>

187
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's pointless.</font>

188
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your voice will not reach Krios.</font>

189
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true!</font>

190
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Krios is...</font>

191
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's more kind than anyone. He's the
purest, most innocent last child of XENOS.</font>

192
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He went slightly off track. That's all.</font>

193
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I talk to him—</font>

194
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not the problem, Medea-san.</font>

195
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He doesn't hate you.</font>

196
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why your voice doesn't reach him.</font>

197
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

198
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only words that will reach him
are those of the person he hates.</font>

199
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My words only.</font>

200
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that's fine.</font>

201
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only need to get revenge on June.</font>

202
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya-kun, you heard me.</font>

203
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please go ahead.</font>

204
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">June-kun.</font>

205
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is vengeance only I have
the right to take on.</font>

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to join us later, June-kun.</font>

207
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With Krios, if you can.</font>

208
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're helpless,
yet you're so selfish, Kyoya-kun.</font>

209
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha...</font>

210
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it, June. Don't speak the truth.</font>

211
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes truth hurts people.</font>

212
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's that. Medea-san, please lead us.</font>

213
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But without me, he can't open this gate—</font>

214
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you hear me? Krios will help him.</font>

215
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe you.</font>

216
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Krios!</font>

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A stage?</font>

218
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the place where Lady Eden
gave the blessing to the people of XENOS.</font>

219
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:30,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Diva sang the melody of blessing
and continued to give Idea to the people.</font>

220
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From this place to the whole planet,
to every single person.</font>

221
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beyond time and age,
for generations before Lady Eden.</font>

222
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it was interrupted?</font>

223
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The cause was unknown.</font>

224
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did the Idea of the stars get depleted
or did the Diva's blood get thinner?</font>

225
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or perhaps Lady Eden's body
has reached its limit?</font>

226
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the Diva's stage.</font>

227
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sacred place to give blessings
to XENOS, to people.</font>

228
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right here.</font>

229
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Was that Lady Eden?</i></font>

230
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Diva with my blood.</i></font>

231
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, it is her.</i></font>

232
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is my mother.</i></font>

233
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Eden.</font>

234
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Finally, the time for revenge has come.</font>

235
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You for Junne.</font>

236
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I for Lukos.</font>

237
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are the rules?</font>

238
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want us to kill each other?
Hit each other?</font>

239
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or... do you want to sing together?</font>

240
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rules?</font>

241
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need no such thing!</font>

242
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world is heading
in the direction we want!</font>

243
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">XENOS and the earthlings
taking hate out on each other</font>

244
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and crushing each other
for their own survival.</font>

245
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing can stop this!</font>

246
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true.</font>

247
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not the direction I want.</font>

248
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And not the direction you want either!</font>

249
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you hated me!</font>

250
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back then, you showed hatred toward me!</font>

251
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I finally got to where you are,
how you feel!</font>

252
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why do you deny my feelings?!</font>

253
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're the same, Krios.</font>

254
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're who I was back then.</font>

255
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Loneliness, sadness, and frustration</font>

256
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">all turned into hatred
and became out of control.</font>

257
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, that hatred
still lives inside me.</font>

258
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me go.</font>

259
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But still, I... we choose to sing.</font>

260
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About our families, our friends,
and about the people we hold dear!</font>

261
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Release me!</font>

262
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not just them!</font>

263
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People who aren't family!</font>

264
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who aren't friends!</font>

265
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even those I hated!</font>

266
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because someday,
we'll understand each other.</font>

267
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may not happen right now.</font>

268
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,250
