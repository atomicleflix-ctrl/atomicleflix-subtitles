10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,070

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you afraid of, Lotton?</font>

272
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I don't recognize you.</font>

273
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who're you supposed to be?</font>

274
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand who's turf 
this is? Lotton here--</font>

275
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You idiot! Stop—</font>

276
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,330
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}THE SLUMS' FAMOUS HUMAN SKEWER</font>

277
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give my regards to Salman!</font>

278
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Harris!</font>

279
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait up, Hajime!</font>

280
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hajime, weren't those your offerings?</font>

281
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just how it goes around here.
I used to do the same thing!</font>

282
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When people die, they're cremated.</font>

283
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As ash, they're carried away on the wind,</font>

284
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">all the way to the sun.</font>

285
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder where they are right about now.</font>

286
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did they make it to the sun?</font>

287
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's hoping they're not hungry.</font>

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you doing?</font>

289
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui is your mom today.</font>

290
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't ask for that, remember?</font>

291
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly...</font>

292
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If only you had Rirui around 
when you were little.</font>

293
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I could've worked hard
 to make things easier for you.</font>

294
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such a shame!</font>

295
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get the feeling things 
would've been even harder.</font>

296
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was great.</font>

297
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just helping myself to some booze!</font>

298
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, don't overdo it, Old Pom.</font>

299
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really hits the spot after so long!</font>

300
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hajime, what're they doing?</font>

301
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fishing for rats.</font>

302
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a way for slum kids 
to make some spare change.</font>

303
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you do that too?</font>

304
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back in the day, yeah.</font>

305
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rirui wants to try!</font>

306
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just once, okay? The other kids are 
trying to earn money for food.</font>

307
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that big one looks pretty good.</font>

308
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll wanna tie it up with the 
line in that box over there.</font>

309
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Okay.</font>

310
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you lower it off the bridge...</font>

311
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And after a while, 
a big old rat will come this way.</font>

312
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you grab a big rock and kill it.</font>

313
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That way, you don't get hurt.</font>

314
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't wanna hit the caterpillar, either.</font>

315
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're valuable bait and can be reused.</font>

316
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna stop?</font>

317
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna do it!</font>

318
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to have a 
barbecued rat party today!</font>

319
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. But don't kill the caterpillar.</font>

320
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Hajime! Come have a drink yourself!</font>

321
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

322
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not yet. Gotta wait...</font>

323
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There! Here it comes!</font>

324
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"If only Rirui had been around 
when you were little," huh?</i></font>

325
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Definitely would've meant more trouble, 
which I sure didn't need, but...</i></font>

326
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dummy!</font>

327
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hajime! My caterpillar!</font>

328
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I bet, on some level...</i></font>

329
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It would've made things more fun.</i></font>

330
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}NEXT TIME: RIRUI AND COCKO</font>
