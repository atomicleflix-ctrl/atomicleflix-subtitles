<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's gotten warm lately.</font>

5
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a volcanic area.</font>

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an unusually warm region

7

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can take a dip there.</font>

11

12
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,870

13
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,750

15
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,270

19
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,150

20
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The village was abandoned 
over thirty years ago.</font>

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hot spring dried up, so the 
adventurers stopped coming.</font>

22
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}One at a time!</font>

23
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a shame, isn't it, Ms. Frieren?</font>

24
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Human villages always vanish the

25
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have to wait until the next town 
to enjoy the hot springs.</font>

26
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How far is it to the next town?</font>

27
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About a week's journey.</font>

28
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we have to wait a whole week.</font>

29
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are there no other 
hot springs around here?</font>

30
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it,</font>

31
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard from my grandfather</font>

32
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that there's a hidden hot spring 
in the mountains back there.</font>

33
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was over thirty years ago, though.</font>

34
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the hidden hot spring 
of the Etwas Mountains.</font>

35
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're familiar with it?</font>

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt it's still there.</font>

37
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's pretty deep in the mountains.</font>

38
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd probably reach a hot spring sooner 
by just heading to the next town.</font>

39
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, Mr. Stark?</font>

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hidden hot spring of 
the Etwas Mountains...</font>

41
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like I've heard those words before.</font>

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I remember now.</font>

43
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, I think I'd like to visit 
the hidden hot spring.</font>

44
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark?</font>

45
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, even though it's technically a hot 
spring, it's really not worth the trouble.</font>

46
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, it's—</font>

47
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We came all the way here already. 
Let's go check it out.</font>

48
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. If you really want to go, let's go.</font>

49
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later, mister!</font>

50
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's play again!</font>

51
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later!</font>

52
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're almost at the hidden hot spring.</font>

53
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, you don't seem very excited.</font>

54
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess not.</font>

55
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wandered through the mountains</font>

56
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in search of the hidden hot spring 
with Himmel and the others.</font>

57
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to go home.</font>

58
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too.</font>

59
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You traveled there with 
Mr. Himmel's party, too?</font>

60
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel wasn't satisfied until he searched 
every nook and cranny of an unusual place.</font>

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said it'd be quick!</font>

62
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you, there's something here.</font>

63
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can feel it in my gut.</font>

64
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you so.</font>

65
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no turning back now.</font>

66
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The road to the hidden hot spring 
is especially brutal.</font>

67
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to pass through the territory 
of a troublesome monster.</font>

68
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's here already.</font>

69
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do this.</font>

70
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dragon, huh?</font>

71
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been a while.</font>

72
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a dragon.</font>

73
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, that monster 
is closer to being a lizard.</font>

74
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lizard?</font>

75
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite agitated.</font>

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's typical of monsters 
when their territory is invaded.</font>

77
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to cut off all three heads at 
the same time, or they'll regenerate.</font>

78
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?!</font>

79
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run, Stark.</font>

80
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a plan.</font>

81
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of—</font>

82
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll split up to the left and right 
and attack all three heads at once.</font>

83
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

84
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do this in as few 
attempts as possible.</font>

85
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If our timing is off, 
it'll keep regenerating.</font>

86
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

87
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The plan you mentioned earlier...</font>

88
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll strike while the monster 
is attacking Stark.</font>

89
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean...</font>

90
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just the bait.</font>

91
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work, both of you.</font>

92
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're finally here.</font>

93
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was difficult.</font>

94
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? I told you we should've just 
headed to the next town.</font>

95
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the hidden hot spring 
of the Etwas Mountains.</font>

96
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so shallow.</font>

97
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just a foot bath.</font>

98
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you it wasn't worth the effort.</font>

99
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is fine.</font>

100
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way, we can all enjoy it together.</font>

101
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

102
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a nice view.</font>

103
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

104
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Mr. Stark, 
why did you want to come here?</font>

105
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard about it from my master.</font>

106
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hidden hot spring of the Etwas 
Mountains was just a foot bath.</font>

107
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't worth the effort at all.</font>

108
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a truly ridiculous adventure.</font>

109
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's strange, though.</font>

110
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't trade my memories</font>

111
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">of those ridiculous adventures 
with my friends for anything.</font>

112
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll never forget that view.</i></font>

113
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you knew, Mr. Stark.</font>

114
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I wanted to see the 
same view my master saw.</font>

115
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is a nice view.</font>

116
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way back is brutal, too.</font>

117
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it wasn't worth 
the effort after all.</font>

118
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,050
<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><b>{\an9}29 years after the death

120
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yeah!</font>

123

124
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,720

126
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,630

136
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's always so hard on me.</i></font>

137
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Fine. It's time for some payback.</i></font>

138
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're that desperate for attention, 
let's go on a date tomorrow.</font>

139
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oops. This never goes well.</i></font>

140
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm dead.</i></font>

141
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. See you tomorrow.</font>

142
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, your book...</font>

143
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why'd she react like that?</i></font>

144
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me...</font>

145
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren...</font>

146
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think? Is she mad?</font>

147
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going to happen to me?</font>

148
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, do you understand 
who you're asking for advice?</font>

149
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you lost your mind?</font>

150
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. Sorry for 
asking the impossible.</font>

151
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never said it was impossible.</font>

152
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a grown woman, you know.</font>

153
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know exactly how a girl thinks.</font>

154
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure? I'm trusting you.</font>

155
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, let me ask you again.</font>

156
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, if I said to you, "Let's go 
on a date," what would you think?</font>

157
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've grown into a fine man, Stark.</font>

158
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so happy, I might treat you to dinner.</font>

159
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, this isn't helping.</font>

160
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This feels like a grandma 
hanging out with her grandson.</font>

161
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just called me a grandma.</font>

162
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's your second offense 
after calling me a hag.</font>

163
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't get away with a third.</font>

164
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you counting? You're scaring me!</font>

165
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, what happens 
on the third offense?</font>

166
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll scream and cry.</font>

167
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My tantrums are scary, you know.</font>

168
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They even made Himmel the Hero 
tremble with fear.</font>

169
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's been crying for three 
full days and nights.</font>

170
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yikes.</font>

171
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Terrifying.</font>

172
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds terrifying.</font>

173
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that how a grown woman behaves?</font>

174
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I understand now that you're 
entirely lacking in tact and sensitivity.</font>

175
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, are you going on a date with Fern?</font>

176
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't feel like 
I can take it back now.</font>

177
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I thought I'd ask you to suggest 
some places she might like.</font>

178
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, never mind. 
I shouldn't have asked—</font>

179
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should we go take a look, then?</font>

180
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

181
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can probably find somewhere.</font>

182
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somewhere she'd like.</font>

183
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should we do now?</font>

184
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we get something to eat?</font>

185
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good idea.</font>

186
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should start by getting her 
something to eat at the market.</font>

187
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She gets cranky when she's hungry.</font>

188
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't skip the food stalls.</font>

189
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern has loved snacking 
since she was little.</font>

190
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'd probably like shops 
with pretty items on display.</font>

191
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern likes baked goods, but what 
she wants depends on her mood,</font>

192
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so you should choose a few dessert shops.</font>

193
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else...</font>

194
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quiet plazas like these 
are an option, too.</font>

195
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously? You know Fern really well.</font>

196
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed, Frieren.</font>

197
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I don't know anything.</font>

198
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not impressive.</font>

199
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heiter was the impressive one.</font>

200
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He talked about Fern's 
preferences all the time.</font>

201
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"She gets cranky when she's hungry,"</font>

202
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"she likes snacking," 
"she likes pretty things,"</font>

203
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and "her preferences change depending on 
her mood" are all things Heiter taught me.</font>

204
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heiter seemed to want me to be 
a parental figure to Fern,</font>

205
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but ultimately, I failed 
to discover anything she liked.</font>

206
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you remember all of that.</font>

207
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you're a good parent to her.</font>

208
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it,</font>

209
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we first celebrated Fern's birthday 
on the road in a place like this.</font>

210
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have some nice things 
to say sometimes, Stark.</font>

211
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, right?</font>

212
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll strike one offense from the record.</font>

213
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks...</font>

214
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, I was asked out on a date.</font>

215
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I do?</font>

216
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, too?</font>

217
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing.</font>

218
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, have you 
ever been on a date?</font>

219
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have.</font>

220
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course you haven't.</font>

221
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you have?!</font>

222
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

223
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who did you go with, and what did you do?</font>

224
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel and I went looking for a lost cat.</font>

225
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were asked to by the owner 
of a magic item shop.</font>

226
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you were just completing a job.</font>

227
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure you can call that a date.</font>

228
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Fern,</font>

229
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when two close friends of opposing sex 
go out with each other and nobody else,</font>

230
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that's a date.</font>

231
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what my master said.</font>

232
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, I went 
on a date with Sein, too.</font>

233
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget it.</font>

234
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good night.</font>
