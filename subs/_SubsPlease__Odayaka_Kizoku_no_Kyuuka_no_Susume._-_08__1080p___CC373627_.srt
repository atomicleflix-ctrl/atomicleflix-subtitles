3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stick out like a sore thumb, Gil.</font>

4
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up. You're the one 
who dragged me here.</font>

5
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We contributed to the production.</font>

6
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you want to see it?</font>

7
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much longer until it starts?</font>

8
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not long, probably.</font>

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that supposed to mean, damn it?!</font>

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's as boisterous as ever.</font>

11
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She sounds a bit desperate for 
someone inspiring their troupe.</font>

12
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me, adventurers.</font>

13
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anyone in the audience 
who can play the violin?</font>

14
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll submit a job request 
and pay you, of course.</font>

15
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen?</font>

17
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our musician was injur—</font>

18
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You tripped and sprained your 
hand? What are you, a child?</font>

19
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get some rest!</font>

20
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You heard her.</font>

21
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get the picture.</font>

22
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you play?</font>

23
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way.</font>

24
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew this wouldn't work.</font>

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have time to learn songs,
so could I play ones I know instead?</font>

26
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't compare to a professional, 
but if you're all right with that...</font>

28
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

29
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boss, boss!</font>

30
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I found someone!</font>

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? I bet it's that 
really classy guy.</font>

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then.</font>

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it comes to it, let's 
synchronize our timing.</font>

34
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

35
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it was you. I appreciate it.</font>

37
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ma'am?</font>

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm playing a handsome young boy.</font>

39
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These instantly heal external injuries.</font>

40
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's low-level, but it should be 
completely healed by tomorrow.</font>

41
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, on your knees!</font>

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, it's not a labyrinth good, 
so it will probably hurt a lot.</font>

43
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine. Do it.</font>

44
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't expect you to memorize it. 
I'll just explain the timing.</font>

45
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With five minutes, I believe I 
can memorize the general plot.</font>

46
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then do it. Please.</font>

47
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many songs can you play? How well?</font>

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well enough that a nobleman with 
a good ear wouldn't complain.</font>

49
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's more than good enough.</font>

50
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can play just over ten minutes of 
complete songs without sheet music.</font>

51
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know four songs that would 
suit the script I saw yesterday,</font>

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">plus ten more partial songs.</font>

53
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you're an 
adventurer, damn it?</font>

54
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am indeed a genuine adventurer.</font>

55
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the adagio at the start...</font>

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep it light, with a steady tempo.</font>

57
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like a waltz.</font>

58
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, for this fight scene, I won't 
be able to match the choreography.</font>

59
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, but could you just stop playing 
here when their swords clash?</font>

60
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as I know the timing.</font>

61
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. You're perfect, damn it!</font>

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for any inconvenience,
but I look forward to working with you.</font>

63
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

64
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's almost time.</font>

65
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Verda, Prince of Incadia.</font>

66
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me tell you about the strange 
events that affected my family.</font>

67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall take your head 
as a lesson to others!</font>

68
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're soft for a scoundrel!</font>

69
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want to make an example out of me, 
you have to hang me while I'm alive!</font>

70
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall be your opponent.</font>

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not bad.</font>

72
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Five.</font>

73
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Four.</i></font>

74
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Three.</i></font>

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Your timing's off. Four.</i></font>

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Three.</i></font>

77
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Two.</i></font>

78
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>One.</i></font>

79
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Zero.</i></font>

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Impressive as always.</i></font>

81
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Explain yourself, damn it!</font>

82
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You suddenly made the stage dark!</font>

83
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My apologies. But I did say 
I'd inconvenience you.</font>

84
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think you were referring 
to a specific event, damn it!</font>

85
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, but he'll recover by tomorrow.</font>

86
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever. I appreciate your help today.</font>

87
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

88
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't have volunteered 
if you knew they'd attack you.</font>

89
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We helped with the production.
Don't you want to see them succeed?</font>

90
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should've told me beforehand.</font>

91
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't have time to explain.</font>

92
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, was it worth it?</font>

93
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, but I wish I could've 
practiced more.</font>

94
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're generally sincere, aren't you?</font>

95
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was the same type of arrow again.</font>

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did they think I couldn't 
defend myself while playing,</font>

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or were they warning me that 
they can get me at anytime?</font>

98
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to do something about this.</font>

99
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm kind of excited to see 
what they'll do next.</font>

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So this is just a game to him?</i></font>

101
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a very nice expression.</font>

102
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is how I always look.</font>

103
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Arial"><font color="#f2f2f1"><font size="24">Several Days Later</font></font></font></font>

104
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a feeling they'll try 
to shoot me again today.</font>

105
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're treating this awfully lightly when 
they're trying to shoot your brains out.</font>

106
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes no difference 
if they can't hit me.</font>

107
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They keep popping out of nowhere.</font>

108
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They must have access to endless fodder.</font>

109
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kid asking to join our 
party is a bandit, isn't he?</font>

110
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

111
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Couldn't we solve this by catching 
him and making him talk?</font>

112
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Instead of making him talk, perhaps...</font>

113
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Gil suggested a practical 
solution for the first time.</i></font>

114
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Perhaps he's getting tired of this.</i></font>

115
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you still want to play, 
then do what you want.</font>

116
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do the same.</font>

117
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

118
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

119
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose you're right, though.</font>

120
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he'll properly sell himself 
today. Perhaps it's about time.</font>

121
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For this to end?</font>

122
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That depends on him.</font>

123
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can't let them run out of patience 
and attack the people around me.</font>

124
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you certainly look like 
you're straight as an arrow.</font>

125
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll do it if they 
want to provoke you.</font>

126
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean, look like?</font>

127
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they hurt Judge or the others, 
I'll be properly angry.</font>

128
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah? I'd like to see that.</font>

129
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, he isn't just a gang member.</font>

130
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

131
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's their boss.</font>

132
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a show going on in the plaza.</font>

133
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

134
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've always been helplessly 
drawn to excitement.</i></font>

135
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I taught myself how to fight.</i></font>

136
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd nearly die taking on monsters 
single-handed and laugh it off.</i></font>

137
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Eventually I learned about adventurers.</i></font>

138
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It seemed like a good way to profit 
off my interests, so I became one.</i></font>

139
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>One day, while searching for a powerful 
monster, I was attacked by bandits.</i></font>

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I turned the tables on them instead. 
I even killed their boss.</i></font>

141
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The insane survivors suggested 
I become a bandit.</i></font>

142
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I went along with the idea.</i></font>

143
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was the start of my life as both 
an adventurer and bandit leader.</i></font>

144
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's crazy.</font>

145
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, boss. Let's name our gang.</font>

146
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we've gained members, we should 
have a real bandit gang name.</font>

147
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

148
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't that be awesome?</font>

149
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

150
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard the Forky Gang showed up again.</font>

151
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're really making a splash. 
How many times is that?</font>

152
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've mistaken our name 
for something really lame.</font>

153
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, did you hear the news?</font>

154
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Blade joined a party.</font>

155
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, with that nobleman, right?</font>

156
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say he's a real adventurer, 
despite how he looks.</font>

157
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A nobleman-like adventurer who 
brought the Blade to heel?</font>

158
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I'll try poking him if 
there's money to be made.</font>

159
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see you struggle like 
you never have before.</font>

160
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

161
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I join your party?</font>

162
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your strengths and motive 
are conflicting. Try again.</font>

163
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm beneath his notice, huh?</i></font>

164
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's so annoying. What should I do next?</i></font>

165
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm excited for tomorrow's show.</font>

166
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Blade is crazy.</font>

167
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is practically an invitation.</font>

168
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't shoot to kill.</font>

169
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might as well wait 
for an exciting scene.</font>

170
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

171
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get it. Was that magic?</font>

172
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't be able 
to block while playing.</font>

173
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we go?</font>

174
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if he'll say yes today.</font>

175
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me join your party.</font>

176
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The usual, please.</font>

177
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eleven, solo C.</font>

178
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My strengths are my dual-wielding 
skills and night vision.</font>

179
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My weaknesses are my flashy 
red hair and overconfidence.</font>

180
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was moved by your 
performance yesterday.</font>

181
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking jobs with someone like 
you is bound to be fun.</font>

182
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Those are appealing qualities 
for an adventurer to have.</i></font>

183
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Will he reject me because 
he doesn't trust me</i></font>

184
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>or accept me so he can keep an eye on me?</i></font>

185
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Either way, the man standing before 
me will have to look at me.</i></font>

186
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were overconfident.</font>

187
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we have a chat?</font>

188
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does this mean you'll let me join you?</font>

189
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've dropped a few hints until now.</font>

190
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

191
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But today, you've given 
me something decisive.</font>

192
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

193
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How does it feel to properly face me?</font>

194
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You figured it out? Seriously?</font>

195
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't try to trick me into 
talking. That's lame.</font>

196
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't be necessary.</font>

197
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd you know?</font>

198
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, it was so obvious, 
I thought it was deliberate.</font>

199
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really were overconfident.</font>

200
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

201
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your reason for wanting to join.</font>

202
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was moved by your 
performance yesterday.</font>

203
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font color="#ffffff">Taking jobs with someone like you...</font></font>

204
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, man.</font>

205
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only people who knew I 
was playing were the troupe,</font>

206
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the audience members around me, and...</font>

207
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The shooter?</font>

208
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it possible that I happened 
to watch the show and saw you?</font>

209
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your beautiful red hair.</font>

210
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're eye-catching enough 
for it to be a weakness.</font>

212
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't miss you from the stage.</font>

213
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's how you knew?</font>

214
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But who welcomes in someone 
they know is a bandit?</font>

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even with a bodyguard,
that's some overconfidence.</font>

216
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's not my bodyguard. 
He's my party member.</font>

217
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I noticed long before that.</font>

218
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Since when?</font>

219
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The moment we met.</font>

220
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean you found me suspicious, right?</font>

221
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I was quite certain.</font>

222
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

223
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may not have known if 
you'd sent someone else.</font>

224
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

225
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your split tongue. Forked tongue.</font>

226
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The boss of the Forky Gang himself 
came to see me, didn't he?</font>

227
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You figured that out, too? Wow!</font>

228
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't trust anyone, do you?</font>

229
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I seriously doubt there's a 
second snake beastman around.</font>

230
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen one 
around here besides me.</font>

231
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what now? Will you turn me in?</font>

232
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I say I will, will you run away?</font>

233
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, although I doubt I could 
under these circumstances.</font>

234
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be honest, I don't 
particularly care about that.</font>

235
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

236
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:25,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That you're a lying, 
ill-mannered bandit leader.</font>

237
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of that particularly matters.</font>

238
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're about to attack 
those around me, aren't you?</font>

239
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd prefer you didn't do that.</font>

240
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm still beneath his notice, huh?</i></font>

241
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I shouldn't let it get to me.</i></font>

242
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can find someone similar 
to play with, and then...</i></font>

243
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

244
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you, Stud.</font>

245
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so annoying!</font>

246
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wrist's broken. Let go of me.</font>

247
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hurts!</font>

248
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think I'd let go of someone who's 
still fighting with a broken wrist?</font>

249
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're quite the bandit leader if 
Gil allowed you to get this close.</font>

250
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder who's faster, him or Stud.</font>

251
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've lost my edge, but I'm 
still not easily beaten.</font>

252
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's amazing.</font>

253
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you move so quickly,
I can hardly tell what's happening.</font>

254
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better learn to do it.</font>

255
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, man.</font>

256
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, who do you choose?</font>

257
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you what you want.</font>

258
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think I can't do it?</font>

259
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're young. You can turn a 
bit of fear into pleasure.</font>

260
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've probably never 
felt true fear before.</font>

261
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where have your spirited responses gone?</font>

262
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fear is self-control.</font>

263
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you lack that, you don't</font>

264
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">understand why
you should act accordingly,</font>

265
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">despite knowing right from wrong.</font>

266
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you see now?</font>
