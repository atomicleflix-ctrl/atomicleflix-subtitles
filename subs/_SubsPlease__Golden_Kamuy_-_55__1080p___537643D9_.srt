00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:19,120

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,230

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,710

wanted to protect his family,</font>

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he could've chosen to live in 
hiding instead of fighting.</font>

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,560

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'd found out where information

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A man named Siromakur. 
Ariko Rikimatsu's father.</font>

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was the first to find

00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A beautiful carving.</font>

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm making it for my son in the army. 
So that he won't forget the Ainu.</font>

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ariko-san, we in the 7th

Rikimatsu-kun as well.</font>

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you truly trust 
Rikimatsu-kun like family...</font>

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We captured the old man over a month ago.</font>

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've probably found the gold by now.</font>

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you go to 
find it with the others?</font>

33
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I couldn't agree 
with how they do things.</font>

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When Kimuspu refused to 
tell us where the gold was,</font>

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the more short-tempered 
ones began to threaten him.</font>

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They even said that if he didn't 
tell us where the gold was,</font>

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'd find his family and harm them.</font>

38
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't allow that!</font>

39
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was smart to part ways 
with those who would try to</font>

40
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">divide the Japanese and Ainu.</font>

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that we know of 
this plan for rebellion,</font>

42
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the 7th Division must take action.</font>

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell us everything, Ariko-san.</font>

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the sake of those young Ainu 
who live as Japanese, as well.</font>

45
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand how they feel.</font>

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I worked with them, thinking there was 
a way to use the gold without violence.</font>

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But those six, especially,</font>

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are all difficult men with little 
relationship to one another.</font>

49
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only their extremist beliefs about 
the Japanese bring them together.</font>

50
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And one very clever man is all 
that keeps them working together.</font>

51
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's true that the Ainu 
near the Saru River eat dirt, huh?</font>

52
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We call it cietoy, "the dirt that we 
eat". We've eaten it for generations!</font>

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Japanese will call you cows and dogs!</font>

54
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

55
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got less respect for you for 
giving a shit what the Japanese think.</font>

56
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell did you say?</font>

57
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, you want to fight?</font>

58
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cietoi is called diatomaceous earth.</font>

59
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a fossil made from a type of algae.</font>

60
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's eaten around the world by 
tribes like those native to America.</font>

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In Karafuto, there's a dish called 
chikaripe that uses diatomaceous earth.</font>

62
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the best food we had.</font>

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It mellows out the seal fat.</font>

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really do know everything.</font>

65
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are amazing.</font>

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is pretty good. I'll take seconds.</font>

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, you...</font>

68
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Discrimination is born of ignorance.</font>

69
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If nothing else, the Ainu 
must understand each other,</font>

70
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and come together as one...</font>

71
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where does this Ainu live?</font>

72
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He lives in Bihoro or Nemuro.</font>

73
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's from Karafuto, I know that much.</font>

74
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you tell me his name? 
What he looks like?</font>

75
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Father...</font>

76
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone calls him "Wilk".</font>

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He has blue eyes and a scar on his face.</font>

78
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So he's come back into my life once more?</i></font>

79
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I fired a single poison arrow at Wilk!</font>

80
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Wilk tell you of 
his past as a guerrilla?</font>

81
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He came to Hokkaido seeking the Ainu gold,</font>

82
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so that he could give it to 
revolutionaries in Russia.</font>

83
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ask him yourself.</font>

84
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I waited outside for a while, and saw 
Ariko Siromakur leave in a hurry.</font>

85
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We lost him.</font>

86
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too dark here in the mountains.</font>

87
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That Ainu moves too damn fast.</font>

88
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gunfire!</font>

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At dawn, I found Ariko-san near death.</font>

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Wilk do this to you?</font>

91
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, he did nothing.</font>

92
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We all killed each other...</font>

93
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those who defended Wilk and those 
who did not killed each other.</font>

94
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The balance that was only 
barely kept by trust in Wilk</font>

95
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was torn apart by the 
poison arrow I fired.</font>

96
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now that Wilk knew someone was 
after him who knew of his past...</font>

97
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lt. Tsurumi!</font>

98
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He ripped the skin off his own face 
and put it over another's skull</font>

99
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to fake his own death.</font>

100
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any other survivors?</font>

101
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, don't die yet!</font>

102
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it.</font>

103
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are supposed to 
be seven Ainu, right?</font>

104
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So who tore apart the bodies?</font>

105
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh dear.</font>

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the heads have been flayed of their 
skin, and their eyes were removed!</font>

107
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

108
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look!</font>

109
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look!</font>

110
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assume the skulls and 
skins were swapped.</font>

111
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And one of them is Kimuspu.</font>

112
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There were eight Ainu present.</font>

113
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He used the old man, Kimuspu, 
whose existence was barely known,</font>

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to hide his own death.</font>

115
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He ripped out the eyes because his 
own eyes were easily recognizable.</font>

116
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He could've just burned them until 
there was nothing but bones.</font>

117
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He wanted us to think that 
he was definitely dead.</font>

118
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami, bring more soldiers.</font>

119
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kikuta, secure the scene.</font>

120
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go after Wilk.</font>

121
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong?</font>

122
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should we tell Private Ariko about 
our involvement in his father's death?</font>

123
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need to tell him.</font>

124
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They killed each other without our help.</font>

125
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But our plan was that they would.</font>

126
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Ariko Ipopte!</font>

127
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What resolve it must've taken 
to rip off his own face!</font>

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given what happened, there was 
no doubt Wilk would be suspected.</font>

129
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how, then, would you be 
treated in Ainu society?</font>

130
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Kiroranke might give 
up if he knew that Wilk,</font>

131
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the clue to the gold, was dead.</font>

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will likely be able to make a federal 
government on the continent.</font>

262
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if it falls to Imperial Russia,</font>

263
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hokkaido will be taken by Russia.</font>

264
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what of Wilk and Hijikata 
Toshizou's Ezo Republic?</font>

265
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they want to be a powerful nation,</font>

266
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'll have to bring in 
immigrants from outside.</font>

267
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's very likely many of those 
migrants will be enemies of Japan.</font>

268
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not speaking of discrimination, 
simply probabilities.</font>

269
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hokkaido should be ruled by those 
who would have it join with Japan.</font>

270
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone whose ancestors 
have lived in that country,</font>

271
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who treasures their homeland 
and loves its people.</font>

272
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Japanese must come 
together to survive.</font>

273
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Far East Federation and Ezo 
Republic are simply not possible!</font>

274
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asirpa, have you ever seen 
one of these gold coins?</font>

275
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They belonged to the Ainu 
who killed each other.</font>

276
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assume they dreamed of 
an independent country,</font>

277
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and tried to make a currency that 
would help to bind the Ainu together.</font>

278
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But look at this.</font>

279
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at the different shades of gold!</font>

280
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The gold dust was taken 
from different areas</font>

281
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and contains different purities of gold,</font>

282
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so it didn't mix properly.</font>

283
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ironically,</font>

284
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">doesn't it feel like it represents their 
attempt and failure to come together?</font>

285
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I see it, Wilk alone wasn't 
the cause of everything, Asirpa.</font>

286
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Ainu have treasures 
made of brass and iron,</font>

287
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but not a single one made of gold, yes?</font>

288
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gold was something the Ainu simply did 
not need to live. It was useless to them.</font>

289
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything,</font>

290
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the search for gold dust polluted 
their rivers and made them starve.</font>

291
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said that the kamuy 
dwell in all things, yes?</font>

292
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Clothes. Knives. Tobacco holders. 
Dishes. Homes. All contain a kamuy.</font>

293
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there are kamuy such as disasters 
and smallpox that threaten humanity too,</font>

294
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are there not?</font>

295
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there is a kamuy of gold,</font>

296
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then isn't it an evil god that 
brings disaster to the Ainu?</font>

297
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One that brings terrible 
death to all who touch it.</font>

298
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One more ugly and violent 
than any other.</font>

299
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A kamuy that's dazzlingly bright, 
and shines with golden light.</font>

300
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could call it a...</font>

301
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">golden kamuy.</font>

302
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,250
<font face="Times New Roman" size="12" color="#62000d"><b>{\an3}<font size="17">Next Time
<font size="27">Ipopte</font></font></b></font>

303
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Next Time: Ipopte!</i></font>
