for not heeding my advice.</font>

139
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe, yeah.</font>

140
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now you see what kind of place this is.</font>

141
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't like it,</font>

142
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">take Dein out and change it 
for the better.</font>

143
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I gotta take down Dein, huh?</font>

144
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just kidding.</font>

145
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run along, now.</font>

146
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Okay. Thanks, Y'lla.</font>

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not gonna take a job?</font>

148
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. I'm just gonna leave for today.</font>

149
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You </i>will<i> bow down to me, slave girl!</i></font>

150
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll settle things with you someday.</i></font>

151
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for looking out.</font>

152
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flum's specialty?</font>

153
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. You mentioned 
her cooking at breakfast.</font>

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you got curious?</font>

155
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, um...</font>

156
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The cheese's aroma is restrained.</font>

157
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's sweet, but the sour kick of 
the apricot jam balances it out.</font>

158
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Flum's cheesecake for you.</font>

159
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep, this is great.</font>

160
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get a perfect score.</font>

161
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like it came out well, Flum.</font>

162
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

163
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's my shortcake, Maria?</font>

164
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's lovely!</font>

165
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So much for a nun's abstinence.</font>

166
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-Please don't misunderstand.</font>

167
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A girl I know back at 
the Church loves cakes,</font>

168
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she's like a little sister to me.</font>

169
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can enjoy your food. 
I'm not gonna stop you.</font>

170
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, Maria's going to town again.</font>

171
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those look good.</font>

172
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heroes' cakes.</font>

173
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could start a business.</font>

174
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would the two of you like to join us?</font>

175
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Would the two of you care to join us?</font>

176
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have some for you as well.</font>

177
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, will you have some too, Jean? 
We baked too much cake.</font>

178
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am far too much of a prodigy 
to associate with nobodies,</font>

179
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I suppose I could humor 
you fools once in a while.</font>

180
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gadhio, Linus. Which cake would you like?</font>

181
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or will you have both?</font>

182
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A tough choice.</font>

183
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there's enough to go around, 
I'll have both.</font>

184
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A wise choice.</font>

185
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just a moment, please.</font>

186
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go, Jean.</font>

187
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds good. 
I wish I could've tasted it.</font>

188
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the first two months after we 
set out to fight the Demon Lord,</font>

189
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there were times when 
everything went well.</font>

190
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master said she was thrown out 
for being a hindrance.</font>

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know now that she was the 
glue holding us together.</font>

192
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She has the power to draw people in.</font>

193
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that made Jean jealous.</font>

194
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flum's a great gal. You won't 
go wrong sticking with her.</font>

195
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if you ever want to say anything 
to her, don't hesitate to speak up.</font>

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

197
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back!</font>

198
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so great to have 
a home to come back to.</font>

199
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome home, Master.</font>

200
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milkit has something 
to ask of you, it seems.</font>

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">E-Eterna!</font>

203
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Put the things you care about 
into words, or she'll never know!</font>

204
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, well...</font>

205
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you to expect all that 
and more from me!</font>

206
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lean on me more!</font>

207
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um...</font>

208
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm worried about you going to the guild.</font>

209
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I think the dress you were 
looking at would suit you very well.</font>

210
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I want to try your cheesecake!</font>

211
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a first.</font>

212
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never made your wishes 
clear like that before.</font>

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so, so glad you finally did.</font>

214
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so happy! I'm just so happy!</font>

215
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-Master...</font>

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Milkit.</font>

217
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master.</font>

218
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milkit!</font>

219
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master!</font>

220
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I missed my chance again.</font>

221
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for havin' me!</font>

222
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome, Sara.</font>

223
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somethin' smells yummy!</font>

224
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have harpusy cream stew, 
sautéed genofish,</font>

225
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">meat and vegetable stir-fry, and...</font>

226
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er... What is this?</font>

227
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pickled herbs. Stude's mother taught me.</font>

228
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This all looks amazing!</font>

229
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, then.</font>

230
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's eat!</font>

231
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uwwy!</font>

232
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Yummy."</font>

233
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you catch that, Flum?</font>

234
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope. No idea.</font>

235
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master.</font>

236
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

237
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meah, is ood.</font>

238
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Yeah, it's good."</font>

239
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miwit's ookin izo gway.</font>

240
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that?</font>

241
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Master.</font>

242
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milkit understood that, huh?</font>

243
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More, please!</font>

244
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To enjoy tea at its finest, 
you need to heat your cup first.</font>

245
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Put the leaves in the teapot,</font>

246
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">put the lid on, and let it steep.</font>

247
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why steep it?</font>

248
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Steeping brings out the tea leaves' 
aroma and components.</font>

249
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's done, girls.</font>

250
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da!</font>

251
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheesecake!</font>

252
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master baked it.</font>

253
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did, Miss Flum?!</font>

254
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milkit requested it. 
Let's eat it together.</font>

255
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hooray!</font>

256
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so yummy!</font>

257
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love the sour jam! Gimme more!</font>

258
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Already?</font>

259
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love cake, ya see.</font>

260
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah...</font>

261
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she was talking about you.</font>

262
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who was?</font>

263
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about it.</font>

264
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say "aah."</font>

265
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can eat by myself. 
You don't have to feed me.</font>

266
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No can do.</font>

267
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna feed you to celebrate 
your first ever request.</font>

268
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now say "aah."</font>

269
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um...</font>

270

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say "aah."</font>

277
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How is it?</font>

278
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's great.</font>

279
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness.</font>

280
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're so close.</font>

281
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't bear to watch.</font>

282
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm kinda envious.</font>

283
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told Eterna about the lab and that 
weird experiment gone nuts.</font>

284
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sara, did you learn anything 
about the lab?</font>

285
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I looked into it after we got back to 
the capital, but I didn't find nothin'.</font>

286
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the records 
you found the kialahri's location in?</font>

287
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were gone.</font>

288
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'd been out for a while, but they 
musta figured I saw and put 'em away.</font>

289
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, the church had documents about it,</font>

290
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so there might be another 
research facility somewhere nearby.</font>

291
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's only so many places 
a nun like me's got access to.</font>

292
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the West 
and East District churches?</font>

293
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can enter them, but...</font>

294
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The West District's church 
also has an orphanage attached.</font>

295
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They wouldn't be able to keep a secret 
research facility under wraps there.</font>

296
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the East's, then?</font>

297
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's where the rich 
and powerful live.</font>

298
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They wouldn't want to get on the bad 
side of the influential people there.</font>

299
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The roots of the kingdom's research 
run deeper than you'd think.</font>

300
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should assume they're still continuing 
somewhere in the capital.</font>

301
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, the kingdom?</font>

302
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The suppression of every religion 
but the Church of Origin,</font>

303
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the ban on herbal medicine, and the 
monopolization of healing through magic...</font>

304
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of those would've been possible 
without the kingdom's backing.</font>

305
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The kingdom and the Church 
had a deep, twisted relationship.</i></font>

306
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>On the surface, the royal army and 
the holy church knights worked together</i></font>

307
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to maintain peace and order, but they were
actually participants in a power struggle.</i></font>

308
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if there are no active research 
facilities, there might still be ruins.</font>

309
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe it's well worth it 
to investigate the capital.</font>

310
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll look into the West District church.</font>

311
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll check out non-church places, then.</font>

312
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Master...</i></font>

313
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please don't do anything reckless.</i></font>

314
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to ask this of you, Sara.</font>

315
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No worries.</font>

316
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a member of the church, it's my duty 
to bring its shadows to light.</font>

317
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Sara.</font>

318
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. I nearly forgot.</font>

319
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, from Mr. Leitch to you.</font>

320
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

321
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't accept this!</font>

322
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it'll make him sad if you don't.</font>

323
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's pretty rude to send back 
a gift. Even for a nun.</font>

324
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right you are. I'll go ahead 
and take it, then.</font>

325
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all sparkly and pretty.</font>

326
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll be going now!</font>

327
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After you drink that, remove the bandages.
I want to examine the affected area.</font>

328
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

329
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. It's healing right.</font>

330
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not the issue.</font>

331
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is, then?</font>

332
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard about how she got poisoned. 
It made me sick to my stomach.</font>

333
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who did it to her?</font>

334
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She doesn't know. 
The effects came out of nowhere.</font>

335
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's likely her previous mistress 
mixed it into her food.</font>

336
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How awful.</font>

337
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who feeds a girl poison 
to make her face fester?</font>

338
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a wicked thing to do.</font>

339
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must've been jealous 
of Milkit's beauty!</font>

340
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you're probably right.</font>

341
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'll have hell to pay 
if I ever run into her.</font>

342
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help too.</font>

343
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the same when we traveled together.
You always try to do too much by yourself.</font>

344
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eterna...</font>

345
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know I can be of help.</font>

346
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

347
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But don't force yourself.</font>

348
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're housemates, remember?</font>

349
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

350
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be counting on you, Eterna.</font>

351
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning, Milkit.</font>

352
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,730
