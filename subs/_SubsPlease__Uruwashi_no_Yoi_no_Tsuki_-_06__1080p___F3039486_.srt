00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">T-To the festival?!</font>

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!</i></font>

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... Yeah...</font>

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always go with you guys, so I wanted 
to let you know ahead of time.</font>

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, that's awesome. I'm so jealous!</font>

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds nice, going to the summer 
festival with a guy.</font>

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, then do you guys want to come with us?</font>

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd feel better if you guys were there.</font>

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you an idiot?</font>

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Read the room.</font>

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I see, I see. That's right.</font>

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The trial period is almost over,</font>

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so you guys would have to 
decide pretty soon, huh?</font>

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what do you want
to do for the summer festival?</font>

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's that time 
of the year, isn't it?</font>

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girls from Class D are all saying 
we should all go together, and—</font>

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go.</font>

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was fast.</font>

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, Teach!</font>

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Ichimura-kun?</font>

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going with Yoi-chan,
so can I be dismissed?</font>

22
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?! That's the 
first I'm hearing of this!</font>

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the first time I'm saying it.</font>

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-When did you guys decide this?!</font>

25
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yesterday.</font>

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yest—</font>

27
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn you! Damn you to <i>hell</i>!</font>

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit wishing ill on me.</font>

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, isn't your little 
experiment almost over?</font>

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still don't have an answer?</font>

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, there's no need to rush that.</font>

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at you, getting carried away.</font>

33
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you really okay saying that?</font>

34
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She might just get taken 
by another man, y'know.</font>

35
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

36
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Prince has been looking 
oddly cute lately.</font>

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true.</font>

38
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's other guys who'd 
be interested in her, too, yeah?</font>

39
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, if one of you falls 
in love with someone else,</font>

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the contract gets terminated, right?</font>

41
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shouldn't you be takin' it 
a little more seriously?</font>

42
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just kiddin'!</font>

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder...</font>

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whose mouth is that ridiculous 
claim coming from?</font>

45
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}O-Ow, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</font>

46
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? It's <i>you</i>, Sentaro-kun!</font>

47
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's the Romero Special!</font>

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I said I was kiddin'!</font>

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sentaro, you got this'?!</font>

50
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No, I give up! I give up!</font>

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And, where's my sorry? Come on.</font>

52
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}And the winner is Ichi!</font>

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoi, Oji-kun.</font>

54
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Business is a bit slow right now, so I'm 
going to head out to get some things.</font>

55
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two go ahead and eat.</font>

56
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, okay.</font>

57
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the meal.</font>

59
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, that's good!</font>

60
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter how many times I eat 
the curry here, it's delicious!</font>

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dad would be happy to hear that.</font>

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I partly took this
job for the free meals.</font>

63
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Free meals are a perk, for sure.</font>

64
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. Yoi-san, that drink you have...</font>

65
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's a lassi.</font>

66
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lassi?</font>

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder if it's sweet.</i></font>

68
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you like sweet things?</font>

69
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no, not particularly—</font>

70
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got a serious sweet tooth!</font>

71
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think I did, 
but apparently I do.</font>

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What do you mean, "apparently"?</font>

73
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, you're an interesting 
person, Yoi-san.</font>

75
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

76
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are yukatas... something guys like?</font>

77
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

78
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's just... my friend is planning to
go to the summer festival with a guy.</font>

79
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems like she's having trouble 
deciding whether to wear one that day...</font>

80
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... she's concerned 
about her boyish look</font>

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and whether it'd look good on her.</font>

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she's wondering what to do.</font>

83
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regardless of whether
it looks good or not,</font>

84
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say I definitely would be happy.</font>

85
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

86
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowing she went through all the trouble 
to dress up just for you</font>

87
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would make any guy excited.</font>

88
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're surprisingly simple like that.</font>

89
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, I see.</i></font>

90
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

91
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'll let her know that.</font>

92
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I could be of help.</font>

93
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is that right.</i></font>

94
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see.</i></font>

95
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

96
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you planning on going with someone 
to the summer festival, Yoi-san?</font>

97
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What...</font>

98
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back!</font>

99
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Welcome back!</font>

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you guys finished eating?</font>

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, it was delicious.</font>

102
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That took me by surprise...</i></font>

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Suddenly locking eyes with him when
he's so close is nerve-wrecking.</i></font>

104
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's right.</font>

105
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I picked up some customers on the way.</font>

106
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

107
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da, it's Ichimura-kun and the gang!</font>

108
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hey, it's really a curry place.</font>

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on in and have lots to eat!</font>

110
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Curry! Curry!</font>

111
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Senpai?!</i></font>

112
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you...</font>

113
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sentaro said he really wanted curry.</font>

114
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Prince.</font>

115
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was opposed to it 'cause I knew 
I'd get in trouble with you, but...</font>

116
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

117
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Did you always have this 
handsome guy working here?</font>

118
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

119
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey, please don't bother our part-timer.</font>

120
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry about them.</font>

121
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no worries.</font>

122
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm, a new part-timer, huh?</font>

123
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm? What?</font>

124
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a shame, Ichi.</font>

125
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such a fleeting love you had there.</font>

126
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?! What're you guys talkin' about?</font>

127
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Prince has been looking 
oddly cute lately.</i></font>

128
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's make sure I got your order right.</font>

129
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A chicken, a beef, and a special, correct?</font>

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you staring 
at my face like that?</font>

132
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm? Oh, my bad, my bad.</font>

133
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just thinkin' about how 
beautiful you are today.</font>

134
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

135
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey, Ichi, how do you say something 
so forward with such ease?</font>

136

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Later.</i></font>

268
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was all so sudden.</i></font>

269
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How was I supposed to respond to that?</i></font>

270
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm home.</font>

271
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! Gosh, it's dark!</font>

272
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome home.</font>

273
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least turn the light on, sheesh!</font>

274
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Mom?</font>

275
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Night shift.</font>

276
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh yeah.</font>

277
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So is that new hire your boyfriend, Yoi?</font>

278
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

279
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, he's not?</font>

280
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His name is Oji, so I thought that's 
where "Prince" came from.</font>

281
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough with the puns!</font>

282
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, bummer. That's boring.</font>

283
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And, in all actuality, I'm not dating him.</font>

284
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why aren't you guys dating?</font>

285
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's kinda the type I can't fully trust.</font>

286
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's so carefree and shifty,
he's hard to figure out.</font>

287
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I were to compare him to an animal, 
he'd be a cunning fox that tricks people.</font>

288
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? He <i>is</i> a prince, right?</font>

289
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, neither of us is entirely 
sure about our feelings yet...</font>

290
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He tells me he loves me, but it's 
always just about the way I look.</font>

291
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this is a first for me, too, so 
it's all a bit overwhelming, you know.</font>

292
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

293
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who cares if it's just about looks?</font>

294
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what's wrong with being smitten by 
someone who has an interest in you?!</font>

295
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to learn to go with 
the flow a little more.</font>

296
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me, do you get the flutters 
with anyone besides this guy?</font>

297
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

298
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Besides... Senpai?</i></font>

299
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's good to be cautious 
before you cross a stone bridge.</font>

300
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But hitting it too many times 
may just break it, so be careful.</font>

301
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's never crossed my mind before.</i></font>

302
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, where did you put the measuring cup?</font>

303
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're gonna make muffins, huh?</font>

304
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

305
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoi-chan!</font>

306
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much flour were you supposed to sift?</font>

307
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What...</font>

308
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

309
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right, sorry.</font>

310
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I'm sorry!</font>

311
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, gosh, it's burnt!</font>

312
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's rare to see you make so many 
simple mistakes, Yoi-chan.</font>

313
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was a little lost in thought.</font>

314
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, what is it?</font>

315
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it about the festival next week?</font>

316
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, right. The festival.</i></font>

317
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're still going together... aren't we?</i></font>

318
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm glad one of 
them turned out pretty.</font>

319
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you take that to Senpai?</font>

320
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Might as well!</font>

321
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on, go on.</font>

322
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way I'm taking it to him!</font>

323
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said stop teasing me, okay?</font>

324
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

325
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do that.</font>

326
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

327
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know where I 
could find Ichimura-senpai?</font>

328
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's about the committee.</font>

329
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, he got called to the staff room for
the incident during our lunch break.</font>

330
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, the staff room?</font>

331
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

332
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sorry, see ya.</font>

333
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, was that a first-year?</font>

334
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was so handsome that I freaked out.</font>

335
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the?</font>

336
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear my inner feminine 
side was, like, screaming.</font>

337
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you serious?</font>

338
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Forget flutters.</i></font>

339
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I didn't feel a single...</i></font>

340
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hang on. What am I even doing?</i></font>

341
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's just being rude.</i></font>

342
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoi-chan?</font>

343
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?</font>

344
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, um. I just happened to be passing by, and...</font>

345
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

346
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a close one.</font>

347
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you hurt?</font>

348
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... I'm fine.</font>

349
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoops.</font>

350
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

351
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay... Thank you very much.</font>

352
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what are you doing here?</font>

353
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got business on the second-year floor?</font>

354
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, um...</font>

355
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ichi!</font>

356
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long's this gonna take?</font>

357
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ichi!</font>

358
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm comin'!</font>

359
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Imma go.</font>

360
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, um...</font>

361
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to walk home together?</font>

362
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me a sec.</font>

363
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, guys, you go on ahead.</font>

364
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You sure?</font>

365
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

366
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See ya later!</font>

367
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

368
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go home.</font>

369
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is there even anyone else...</i></font>

370

371
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, did you need to do 
something in the staff room?</font>

372
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, they found out I slipped out
 during lunch to buy a beef bowl.</font>

373
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A beef... That'd definitely 
get you in trouble.</font>

374
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really thought I wouldn't get caught.</font>

375
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used all sorts of secret shortcuts, too.</font>

376
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Come to think of it, he does come 
out of strange places, doesn't he?</i></font>

377
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If only I were a wizard.</font>

378
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could use a broom to zoom around, 
or become invisible to sneak out.</font>

379
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't it be faster to use magic 
to make the beef bowl then?</font>

380
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a wizard, after all.</font>

381
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tou​ché.</font>

382
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He didn't think of that?</i></font>

383
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Genius! Marvelous! Beautiful!</font>

384
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What does "beautiful" have 
to do with it?</i></font>

385
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh... We're sort of having a 
normal conversation, aren't we?</i></font>

386
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:23,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, this is totally off the subject, 
but if you'd like, this is...</font>

387
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Who is even?!</i></font>

388
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?!</font>

389

a hold of the manager.</font>

392
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you let him know that my train's 
delayed and I'm running a little late?</font>

393
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, all right. Will do.</i></font>

394
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

395
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys exchanged numbers, huh?</font>

396
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yeah. We work in shifts, so...</font>

397
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-huh...</font>

398
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't like it.</font>

399
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,440
