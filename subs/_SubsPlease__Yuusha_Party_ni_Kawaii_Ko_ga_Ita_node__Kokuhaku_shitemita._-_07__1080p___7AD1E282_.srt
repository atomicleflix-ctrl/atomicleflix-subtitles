00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Welcome! Step right up!</font>

2
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm bored.</i></font>

3
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My ban's finally lifted, but 
Cecilia's too busy to hang out.</i></font>

4
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You won't find these anywhere else!</font>

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kramen?</font>

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, Yoki.</font>

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Off work today?</font>

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, well, since I haven't bought 
an anniversary gift yet...</font>

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still haven't given her anything?</font>

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, then! I'll help you out!</font>

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe she'd like one of these?</font>

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll go great with a maid uniform,</font>

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it's right in line with your tastes!</font>

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only thing I'm into 
is the maid uniform!</font>

15
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, you gotta get this.</font>

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like hell I do!</font>

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've already bought what I came here for.</font>

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, okay. Sorry, man.</font>

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That black full-length 
coat is a chuuni's dream!</font>

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that bat-shaped full-face helmet!</font>

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Awesome! It's perfect!</font>

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Really?</font>

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to try them on?</font>

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. I want the 
zig-zaggy sword, too.</font>

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well?</font>

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is indeed the appearance 
my soul has long desired!</font>

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yikes.</font>

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you serious?</font>

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, Kramen, give me a quest!</font>

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will handle any mission you 
may have in the blink of an eye!</font>

32
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Didn't you take today off?</font>

33
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but you know.</font>

34
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that...</font>

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a new shikigami of yours?</font>

36
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you calling a shikigami?!</font>

37
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's an old acquaintance. I'm giving him 
some pesky quests I've had piling up.</font>

38
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We only have four Rank A quests right now.</font>

39
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which would you like?</font>

40
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of them.</font>

41
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Four at one time?!</font>

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. Leave them to me.</font>

43
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And, um... what's your name?</font>

44
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Magic Swordsman of Black Lightning!</font>

45
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THE MAGIC SWORDSMAN OF BLACK LIGHTNING</font>

46
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You heard the man. Sign him up.</font>

47
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will regret showing 
yourself before me!</font>

48
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is the power of my magic sword!</font>

49
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The heart of a dragon. All yours.</font>

50
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much!</font>

51
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will save my daughter's life!</font>

52
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He took down a dragon?</font>

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredible...</font>

54
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's definitely talented, at least.</font>

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, this is the last quest.</font>

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Holy Bell!</font>

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Way to go, boss!</font>

58
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The target is up past here.</font>

59
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger dodger!</font>

60
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dodger!</font>

61
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be taking everything in here.</font>

62
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of it!</font>

63
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Behave yourself and we won't hurt you.</font>

64
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's there?!</font>

65
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've found you, Phantom Thief Envy!</font>

66
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hup!</font>

67
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't think you can run from the 
Magic Swordsman of Black Lightning.</font>

68
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you come quietly, you won't 
get hurt. What'll it be?</font>

69
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Wh-Who the heck is this weirdo?</font>

70
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's making <i>me</i> embarrassed.</font>

71
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This clown stands in the 
way of our ambition!</font>

72
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get him, Jealousy, Heartburn!</font>

73
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just leave this to us!</font>

74
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To us!</font>

75
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now, it's showtime!</font>

76
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taste my lightning!</font>

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all tingly!</font>

78
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I can use magic, too!</font>

79
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will become rust on my magic sword!</font>

80
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. It's blunt-edged.</font>

81
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you.</font>

82
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're unhurt?</font>

83
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! Now I can deliver these Valentine's 
chocolates to the townspeople!</font>

84
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Valentine's?</font>

85
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They have Valentine's 
Day in this world, too?</i></font>

86
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

87
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

88
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am the Magic Swordsman of Black 
Lightning. No one to be suspicious of.</font>

89
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I </i>knew<i> it.</i></font>

90
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's Yoki.</i></font>

91
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you do this?</font>

92
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get the wrong idea.</font>

93
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These three are thieves.</font>

94
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let all of you take 
it from here. Farewell!</font>

95
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

96
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need to pursue.</font>

97
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't need to pursue 
that guy, apparently.</font>

98
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-All right.</font>

99
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The people are on the ground are 
Phantom Thief Envy and his buddies,</font>

100
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as the quest described.</font>

101
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take them in right away.</font>

102
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

103
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take a look around the area.</font>

104
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that's how Raven's 
been communicating, huh?</i></font>

105
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What was he doing before 
Duke joined the order?</i></font>

106
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you're still here, Captain.</font>

107
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's so damn sharp!</i></font>

108
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know how long you've 
been a magic swordsman...</font>

109
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Magic Swordsman of Black Lightning!</font>

110
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...but you should probably start 
coming back to your senses now.</font>

111
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get all embarrassed and start 
thrashing around after every rampage.</font>

112
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a real headache, you know, Captain.</font>

113
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you'd be more normal
 since you came to the humans' city.</font>

114
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might want to look in a mirror.</font>

115
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph!</font>

116
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't this all-black 
outfit awesome, though?</font>

117
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've done it again!</font>

118
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's your reward for nabbing 
Envy and his buddies.</font>

119
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank ya!</font>

120
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was up with them, anyway?</font>

121
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They used to be B-Rank adventurers,</font>

122
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but then they found some weird book in 
a dungeon and went off the deep end.</font>

123
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that all about?</font>

124
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said they were going 
to destroy Valentine's Day</font>

125
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and started stealing cacao and chocolate.</font>

126
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I get how they feel, but...</font>

127
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Begin by melting it over hot water.</font>

128
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teacher...</font>

129
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very good.</font>

130
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First hurdle.</font>

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting the right water 
temperature is crucial.</font>

132
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Sophia, this won't crack.</font>

133
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, my.</font>

134
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

135
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a problem.</font>

136
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure are making a lot.</font>

137
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give them to the kids at the 
orphanage and everyone who's helped me.</font>

140
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've awakened, boy?</font>

141
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,130

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's an insane amount of energy!</font>

157

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

158
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, it's chocolate?!</font>

159
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today's Valentine's Day, you know.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just so you know, you can't have any!</font>

165
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want any, damn it!</font>

166
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you explode!</font>

167
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why you're here, huh?</font>

168
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I can't go back to my room.</font>

177
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, um...</font>

178
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've always been there for me at work.</font>

179

191
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Drop off chocolates for 
the hero right here!</font>

192
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hero!</font>

193
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please hurry!</font>

194
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}If you want to give them to him 
personally, the line's over there!</font>

195
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it! What the hell?!</font>

196
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just how popular can a guy be?!</font>

197
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This world is so unfair!</font>

198
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, if it isn't the civilian.</font>

199
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, Mikana. Are you 
getting in line, too?</font>

200
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure. I'm not a 
good cook or anything.</font>

201
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I should just go home.</font>

202
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Er, um...</font>

203
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, there you are!</font>

204
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuga!</font>

205
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to keep you waiting. Good 
to see you again too, Yoki!</font>

206
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here? 
Everyone's waiting for you.</font>

207
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, sorry. But I wanted to 
get your chocolates first.</font>

208
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But...</font>

209
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they came out weird again this year, 
so they probably aren't any good...</font>

210
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine. I'll take them.</font>

211
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wh-What the hell?!</i></font>

212
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? They're no good, right?</font>

213
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This goes way beyond that!</i></font>

214
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you talking about? They're great!</font>

215
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?!</font>

216
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just don't feel like it's Valentine's Day 
until I've had your chocolates, Mikana.</font>

217
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, isn't that Yuga?</font>

218
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move it! Eternal Friend!</font>

219
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Welp, I still ended up here.</i></font>

220
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm so pathetic.</i></font>

221
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, if it isn't Yoki.</font>

222
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain!</font>

223
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're looking for 
Cecilia, she went to town.</font>

224
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

225
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look what I got!</font>

226
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's some for you, too.</font>

227
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No... I don't want chocolates 
from anyone other than Cecilia...</font>

228
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Mine aren't good enough for you?</font>

229
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay! More for me!</font>

230
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take them.</font>

231
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a good boy.</font>

232
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain!</font>

233
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Envy has escaped from prison!</font>

234
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

235
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Lady Cecilia.</font>

236
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was...</font>

237
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We speak for all those</font>

238
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who have been alienated by the 
blessings of Valentine's Day!</font>

239
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The chocolates!</font>

240
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could this be happening?!</font>

241
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Serves you right!</font>

242
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring down the hammer on all those who 
are fawned on for their good looks!</font>

243
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring it down!</font>

244
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it!</font>

245
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you trying to ruin Valentine's Day?!</font>

246
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up! A hot guy like you 
who gets tons of chocolates</font>

247
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has no idea how miserable we feel!</font>

248
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No idea!</font>

249
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right! People like you are 
always belittling people like me!</font>

250
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch out!</font>

251
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?!</font>

252
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're really making a mess of things.</font>

253
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll hold the monster here.</font>

254
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys get the townsfolk to safety!</font>

255
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the end of Valentine's Day!</font>

256
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it!</font>

257
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

258
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough of this senseless violence.</font>

259
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who the hell are you?</font>

260
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you?!</font>

261
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I completely understand how you feel.</font>

262
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If my position were slightly different, 
I might be doing what you're doing.</font>

263
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds kind of moving 
if you're barely listening,</font>

264
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but what he's actually 
saying is pretty damn sad.</font>

265
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But flying into a rage because 
you didn't get chocolates</font>

266
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the height of foolishness!</font>

267
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look like you're in the 
same boat as us, though!</font>

268
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet you haven't gotten any chocolates!</font>

269
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did.</font>

270
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From who?</font>

271
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My friend's mom.</font>

272
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow. Embarrassing.</font>

273
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't admitting that 
feel meaningless to you?!</font>

274
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not meaningless!</font>

275
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not as if you're holding out any 
hope for Valentine's Day, either!</font>

276
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am!</font>

277
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't give up on getting chocolates</font>

278
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from the girl I love
until this day is over!</font>

279
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girl you love?!</font>

280
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See?! You want to get chocolates 
from the one you love, too!</font>

281
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting chocolates from someone who 
doesn't matter is just a headache!</font>

282
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is not!</font>

283
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as their heart went into 
that chocolate, it makes me happy!</font>

284
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar!</font>

285
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki!</font>

286
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia!</font>

287
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

288
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

289
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are all of our chocolates!</font>

290
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know what'll happen 
if we damage that thing!</font>

291
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give them back.</font>

292
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give them back. Give them back!</font>

293
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give Cecilia's chocolate back!</font>

294
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no!</font>

295
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You... were a girl all along?</font>

296
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up!</font>

297
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are girls who hate 
Valentine's Day, too!</font>

298
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I don't want chocolates 
from a tomboy like you!</font>

299
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

300
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody ever wants my chocolates.</font>

301
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I... I...</font>

302
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true.</font>

303
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

304
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can only say that because you're hot!</font>

305
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy to get chocolates from anyone 
as long as their heart went into it.</font>

306
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hero...</font>

307
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here we go again.</font>

308
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're getting all the glory in the end?!</font>

309
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is why I hate hot guys!</font>

310
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki, you did so well.</font>

311
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

312
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you... accept this?</font>

313
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

314
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness.</font>

315
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, she gave you some, too?</font>

316
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those cookies are really good.</font>

317
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You guys got the same thing?</font>

318
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}WITH MY THANKS FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO</font>

319
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? There's a cake, too.</font>

320
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"With my thanks for everything you do"?</font>

321
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? No fair! Why did only you get cake?</font>

322
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

323
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's one of a kind.</font>

324
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean...</font>

325
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hell yeah!</font>
