00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a tilling machine.</font>

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will save us 
a lot of time and effort.</font>

11
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've created another great invention.</font>

12
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad to be useful.</font>

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now let's get weeding again.</font>

14
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will publish a new book for 
Sakuna by the end of the year.</font>

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa!</font>

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made treats.</font>

19
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're beautiful.</font>

20
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that?</font>

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those blades won't last long, 
so I made new ones.</font>

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did? You have my thanks.</font>

23
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't write.</font>

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should be able to finish writing 
about growing rice.</font>

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no. The rain 
is making the water rise.</font>

26
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Kokorowa?</font>

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna, the rice.</font>

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I'll handle it.</font>

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were so small at first.</font>

30
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've grown so much.</font>

31
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not struggling to grow rice 
thanks to Sakuna and her friends.</font>

32
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tauemon, does this 
look adequately drained?</font>

33
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's about time to add 
the water back in.</font>

35
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't more stems produce more rice?</font>

36
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The offshoots divide 
their ability to grow,</font>

37
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">making the grains smaller.</font>

38
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Minimizing the number of stems 
produces good, large grains.</font>

40
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It also keeps the soil firm, 
making the rice easier to harvest.</font>

41
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The harvest...</font>

42
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that they've grown this much,</font>

43
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we need only maintain course 
until the harvest.</font>

44
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you're right.</font>

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

46
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the temperature rises, 
the rice will grow rapidly.</font>

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the rice isn't 
the only thing that will grow.</font>

48
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that?</font>

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Straight swift larva.</font>

50
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Large numbers of insects will appear,</font>

51
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">including plant hoppers and stink bugs.</font>

52
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Insects?</font>

53
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's beautiful.</font>

54
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm exhausted.</font>

55
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Kokorowa.</font>

56
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good evening.</font>

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your clothes... Where did you go today?</font>

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To Rockslide Passage, 
to look for Flaming Cores.</font>

59
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The foot of the volcano? 
But it's so dangerous.</font>

60
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you do that?</font>

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mixing them into fertilizer 
helps control pests.</font>

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't find any this time, though.</font>

63
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely pests aren't a concern 
if the plants look this nice.</font>

64
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weeds can be removed by hand,
 but not bugs.</font>

65
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no such thing 
as being too careful.</font>

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It happened before I was born.</font>

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was an unprecedented 
famine that affected thousands.</font>

68
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was caused by pests. 
Straight swift larva.</font>

69
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Straight swift larva?</font>

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those small insects I see sometimes?</font>

71
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

72
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But in large numbers, they cause 
wilting and ruin rice plants.</font>

73
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been fine until now,</font>

74
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but who knows what would happen to us 
if that happened on Hinoe Island?</font>

75
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've got the goddesses of harvest 
and invention on the island.</font>

76
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can overcome any problem.</font>

77
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have nothing to fear.</font>

78
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

79
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At very least, I'm sure we'll be fine 
with Sakuna helping us.</font>

80
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What could be more dependable 
than two goddesses on our side?</font>

81
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rice...</font>

83
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's sprouting.</font>

84
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must tell Sakuna.</font>

85
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna.</font>

86
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have news.</font>

87
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The field...</font>

88
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yours, too?</font>

89
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the damage?</font>

90
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damage?</font>

91
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to tell you my rice is sprouting.</font>

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So your field is fine.</font>

93
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened?</font>

94
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They wilted.</font>

95
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are the wilted plants?</font>

96
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just the beginning.</font>

97
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The plants affected by straight 
swift larva are wilting instantly.</font>

98
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will happen to the plants?</font>

99
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only will they not produce rice,</font>

100
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the whole field could be affected.</font>

101
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

102
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no.</font>

103
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, too?</font>

104
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm worried that this happened so soon.</font>

105
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Straight swift larva 
mostly show up in the fall.</font>

107
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this time, they appeared 
right after the rice sprouted.</font>

108
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's this bad now,</font>

109
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they could multiply 
to even greater numbers.</font>

110
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then...</font>

111
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happens then?</font>

112
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This year's Amahoho crop 
could fail completely.</font>

113
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna, I'm going to take 
another look at my field.</font>

114
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

115
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's cut the wilted plants.</font>

116
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you wish.</font>

117
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Kokorowa.</font>

118
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all.</font>

119
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad the damage 
didn't spread further.</font>

120
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, what are we going to do?</font>

121
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only summer.</font>

122
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going to happen in the fall?</font>

123
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have a drastically reduced harvest.</font>

124
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Sakuna...</font>

125
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna?</font>

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa?</font>

127
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here at night?</font>

128
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to look for 
Flaming Cores, aren't you?</font>

129
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't find any in Rockslide Passage.</font>

130
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going further up the volcano.</font>

131
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please take me with you.</font>

132
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate the sentiment, but no.</font>

133
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is all I can do.</font>

135
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should do what only you can do, too.</font>

136
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd prefer that.</font>

137
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What only I can do?</font>

138
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lady Toyohana's scrolls on agriculture...</i></font>

139
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Perhaps there's something in here.</i></font>

140
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna.</font>

141
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back, Kokorowa.</font>

142
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, wait. Good morning.</font>

143
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you hurt?</font>

144
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

145
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

146
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredible. You actually found one.</font>

147
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I searched all night, 
and this is all I found.</font>

148
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only enough for one row of rice.</font>

149
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm thinking about 
searching elsewhere, too.</font>

150
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna, I have a suggestion.</font>

151
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When was the last time we performed 
the Mushiokuri ceremony?</font>

152
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fields have already suffered 
damage. Isn't it too late?</font>

153
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This method was described 
in my mother's scrolls.</font>

154
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a bit different from 
the ceremony we performed.</font>

155
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that oil?</font>

156
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

157
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to scatter this 
toad oil all over the fields.</font>

158
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We pound the rice with mighty blows</i></font>

159
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:58,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And say farewell to pests</i></font>

160
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Send off the pests and dance</i></font>

161
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Let the golden flowers bloom</i></font>

162
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:39,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Let the golden flowers bloom</i></font>

163
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why can't I come up with any ideas?</font>

164
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've experienced so 
many aspects of growing rice.</font>

165
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Again.</font>

166
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I didn't just imagine it.</font>

167
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a dragon?</font>

168
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that?</font>

169
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a dragon.</font>

170
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a swarm of plant hoppers.</font>

171
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are they swarming around the boat?</font>

172
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I bring the swarm with me?</font>

173
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why are there so many?</font>

174
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll burn them away.</font>

175
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A demon insect?</font>

176
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it absorbing the plant hoppers?</font>

177
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I shall defeat it.</font>

178
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Automatons!</font>

179
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I...</i></font>

180
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, that's...</font>

181
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is fantastic!</font>

182
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

183
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really interesting!</font>

184
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Really?</font>

185
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you write this?</font>

186
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, it wasn't me.</font>

187
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

188
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder who wrote this.</font>

189
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to read what happens next.</font>

190
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why am I recalling the past now?</i></font>

191
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa!</font>

192
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We made it in time.</font>

193
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna and Tama.</font>

194
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right?</font>

195
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must've turned it into a demon.</font>

196
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I destroyed all 
the barrier stones.</font>

197
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa, you did well on your own.</font>

198
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I caused all of this.</font>

199
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The plant hoppers I brought on 
my ship made that demon insect.</font>

200
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did nothing wrong. He did.</font>

201
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pests come with growing rice.</font>

202
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not your fault.</font>

203
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let's beat that thing and go home.</font>

204
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

205
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-Incredible...</font>

206
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,580

207
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

208
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna!</font>

209
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna needs help if we're to defeat it.</font>

210
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness!</font>

211
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,060

212
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Mushiokuri ceremony!</font>

213
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's it.</font>

214
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,100

215
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

216
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna?</font>

217

218

219
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good grief.</font>

220
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now let's go home.</font>

221
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can barely stay awake.</font>

222
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa? What's wrong?</font>

223
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't breathe.</font>

224
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,890

coming to my rescue.</font>

225
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. I'm your best friend.</font>

226
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,360

227

228
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time to harvest the rice.</font>

229
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They look fine. They're ready to harvest.</font>

230
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,110

231
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you.</font>

232
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,680

233
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it, Lady Kokorowa.</font>

234
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do it!</font>

235
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like this, Kokorowa.</font>

244
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Kokorowa's new rice.</font>

245
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the white rice I grew?</font>
