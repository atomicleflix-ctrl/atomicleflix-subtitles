1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always wanted to ride in one of these!</font>

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're getting too wound up, Shiek.</font>

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're on our way to 
help Cecilia, you know.</font>

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just had to tag along...</font>

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You were gonna leave me behind?</font>

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Damn it! It was supposed 
to be just me and Cecilia!</i></font>

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry to drag you two 
along on my business.</font>

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think... I'm a bit motion-sick...</font>

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should we take a break?</font>

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, then drink this.</font>

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an infusion made from 
a secret pixie recipe!</font>

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much.</font>

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I feel better.</font>

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good!</font>

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? I'm pretty useful, right?</font>

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">G-Get off me!</font>

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be honest, I'm relieved 
that you're both with me.</font>

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure! You can count on me!</font>

21
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can count on me, too!</font>

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said get off me!</font>

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For crying out loud...</font>

24
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard they had been 
attacked by bandits...</font>

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This looks pretty bad.</font>

26
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, well!</font>

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never expected Lady 
Cecilia to come to our aid.</font>

28
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And... who are these two?</font>

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My friends. They're here to help me.</font>

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're skilled at healing, 
so don't worry about a thing.</font>

31
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello.</font>

32
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, that is reassuring.</font>

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much!</font>

34
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care of yourself, now.</font>

35
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Cecilia's really giving it her all.</i></font>

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Look at her, trying her hardest.</i></font>

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care.</font>

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Yoki.</font>

39
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't Lady Cecilia a wonderful person?</font>

40
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

41
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right?! Isn't she?!</i></font>

42
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, the fact that no one was 
killed is kind of a silver lining.</font>

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, the bandits suddenly turned and fled.</font>

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They fled?</font>

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone showed up out of 
nowhere and cut them down.</font>

46
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Infighting?</i></font>

47
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, please!</font>

48
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Cecilia...</i></font>

49
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia, maybe you should 
take a little break?</font>

50
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm all right.</font>

51
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Holy Bell.</font>

52
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay! She's only asleep.</font>

53
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have a place where she can rest?</font>

54
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, she's awake.</font>

55
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what I'm about to say, don't you?</font>

56
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I used magic to put 
you to sleep without warning.</font>

57
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not right to ignore 
someone's own will.</font>

58
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's not good to overdo it, either.</font>

59
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd kept healing like that, 
you would've knocked yourself out.</font>

60
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you're right.</font>

61
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But please don't ever do that again, okay?</font>

62
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise.</font>

63
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finished treating the 
villagers, so don't worry.</font>

64
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki...</font>

65
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

66
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So cute!</i></font>

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, nah...</font>

68
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on in!</font>

69
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, Lady Cecilia. Are you feeling better?</font>

70
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I worried you.</font>

71
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. I'm sorry to bring 
this up when you're exhausted,</font>

72
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's a little girl named Teal 
living on the outskirts of town.</font>

73
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could I trouble you to take a look at her?</font>

74
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did the bandits hurt her, too?</font>

75
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, thankfully, she was not attacked.</font>

76
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Teal has been sickly since she was 
born, and she's always stuck in bed.</font>

77
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm worried about her.</font>

78
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

79
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you tell me where she is?</font>

80
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

81
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in.</font>

82
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who might you be?</font>

83
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry to drop in unannounced.</font>

84
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Cecilia.</font>

85
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Yoki, and this is Shiek.</font>

86
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The village headman asked us to come.</font>

87
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The headma—</font>

88
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek, you're up.</font>

89
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

90
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this medicine.</font>

91
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry.</font>

92
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite how he looks, 
Shiek knows his stuff.</font>

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Captain, what was 
that about how I look?!</font>

94
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I feel a little bit better.</font>

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's great!</font>

96
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for giving me 
this amazing medicine.</font>

97
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be the guardian 
deity's divine protection.</font>

98
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guardian deity?</font>

99
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't know him?</font>

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the statue of the god 
on the outskirts of town!</font>

101
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A statue of...</font>

102
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...a god?</font>

103
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The day the bandits came,</font>

104
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suddenly grew sleepy on my way 
home from taking him an offering,</font>

105
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I escaped their attack!</font>

106
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wasn't that just coincidence?</font>

107
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not all! When I 
was seven years old...</font>

108
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just when I thought it was all over...</font>

109
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the guardian deity saved my life!</font>

110
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What could it be if not 
his divine protection?</font>

111
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Intense sleepiness and black lightning?</font>

112
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dark magic?</font>

113
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki, this sounds a bit suspicious.</font>

114
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It isn't suspicious at all!</font>

115
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One look at him, and you'll understand!</font>

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, this is...</font>

117
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...obviously...</font>

118
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's so wonderful!</font>

119
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A demon statue?</font>

120
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't allow anyone to 
belittle the guardian de—</font>

121
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal!</font>

122
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry we pushed you so hard.</font>

123
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't I take you home?</font>

124
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, it looks just like...</font>

125
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the gargoyles in the Demon King's castle.</font>

126
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is a gargoyle! Shiek!</font>

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

128
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right here!</font>

129
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain, what should we do with him?</font>

130
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you're quick.</font>

131
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, can you speak?</font>

132
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want to kill me, do it!</font>

133
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Kay!</font>

134
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, wait, wait.</font>

135
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want to talk to him.</font>

136
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't come to kill me?</font>

137
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who attacked us first.</font>

138
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize.</font>

139
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard that you knew what I was,</font>

140
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then something about 
the Demon King's castle.</font>

141
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're sorry, too.</font>

142
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But how did a gargoyle like you become 
this village's guardian deity?</font>

143
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was originally made to 
guard a certain temple,</font>

144
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but long ago, I was stolen 
from it by bandits.</font>

145
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then they attacked this village,</font>

146
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I brought down divine 
punishment upon them.</font>

147
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The villagers have been calling me 
their guardian deity ever since.</font>

148
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only that little girl still 
comes to see me, though.</font>

149
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal?</font>

150
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

151
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nearly every day since I saved 
her from those monsters,</font>

152
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she has been cleaning this 
little shrine for me.</font>

153
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I learned that bandits 
attacked again yesterday,</font>

154
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I kept her safe.</font>

155
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

156
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you don't mean the 
humans any harm, then?</font>

157
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. I only live here.</font>

158
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no intention of involving 
myself with the humans in any way.</font>

159
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess there's no problem, then.</font>

160
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to bother you. Shiek, got a sec?</font>

161
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, Captain?</font>

162
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to talk to you.</font>

163
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going back to the inn first 
because he was sleepy...</font>

164
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek is just adorable, isn't he?</font>

165
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's still a kid, after all.</font>

166
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Though the truth is that 
I sent him back myself.</i></font>

167
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Now it's just the two of us!</i></font>

168
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something the matter?</font>

169
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no! Nothing at all!</font>

170
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, uh...</font>

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was wondering if it's okay 
to just let that gargoyle be.</font>

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does seem like a problem that 
there's a monster in the village...</font>

173
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he doesn't seem to be 
bothering the villagers.</font>

174
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like he's kept to 
himself the whole time,</font>

176
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I think it'll be fine.</font>

177
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we put the matter on hold for now?</font>

178
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

179
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>C-Crap! What do I do?</i></font>

180
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm out of stuff to talk about!</i></font>

181
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia!</font>

182
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, um... watch your step.</font>

183
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right!</font>

184
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Walking around at night 
is dangerous, y'know.</font>

185
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

186
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

187
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the bandits!</font>

188
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take all the money and food you can find!</font>

189
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop right there.</font>

190
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will not allow any further evil acts!</font>

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who the hell are you brats?</font>

192
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're up, Shiek.</font>

193
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, here I go.</font>

194
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

195
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You little...</font>

196
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's strong...</font>

197
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He isn't my subordinate for nothing.</font>

198
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'd better get 
in on this fight, too.</font>

199
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll back you up.</font>

200
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Storm Blow!</font>

201
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's next?</font>

202
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki! You saved me!</font>

203
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a problem.</font>

204
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that...</font>

205
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the guardian deity's shrine?</font>

206
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek, head over there.</font>

207
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

208
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get over yourselves!</font>

209
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think two little 
brats can take us alone?!</font>

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could handle the likes of you by myself.</font>

211
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here I go.</font>

212
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hyper Storm!</font>

213
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, they're taken care of.</font>

214
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek isn't back yet?</font>

215
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would seem not.</font>

216
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guardian deity! Hang in there!</font>

217
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek!</font>

218
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah. The celebrity appears at last.</font>

219
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who the hell is he?</font>

220
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's Miller, the hero 
of the Gallis Empire!</font>

221
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hero? There are other 
ones besides yours?</font>

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-The battle's not over yet...</font>

223
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek, don't push yourself too hard.</font>

224
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened?</font>

225
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He came up from behind while the 
gargoyle was protecting Teal, and...</font>

226
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... tried to protect them, but...</font>

227
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You piece of...</font>

228
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of moron defends a gargoyle?</font>

229
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it!</font>

230
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Don't we need to kill the monster?</font>

231
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop. He's only protecting Teal.</font>

232
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll slice the brat 
in two along with him.</font>

233
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like hell you will!</font>

234
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My magic was erased?!</font>

235
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't! Please, fall back!</font>

236
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're no match for him!</font>

237
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His weapon is a man-made 
magic sword called Magic Eater.</font>

238
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It absorbs magic!</font>

239
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You heard her. So back off!</font>

240
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guardian deity!</font>

241
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stop this!</font>

242
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you harm a citizen of 
Clariness, it'll lead to war!</font>

243
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">War sounds great. I'd love that.</font>

244
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can hardly enjoy killing when 
the world's at peace, can I?</font>

245
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But in a war, I can kill all I want.</font>

246
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right, my good lady?</font>

247
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have no pride as a hero, do you?</font>

248
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't let this guy go free.</font>

249
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic won't work on me, you know.</font>

250
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

251
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pretty pathetic, for all your bluster.</font>

252
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just a little greeting.</font>

253
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you, magic won't work on me!</font>

254
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you try using a weapon?</font>

255
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unfortunately, magic is all I can use.</font>

256
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot!</font>

257
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not enough!</font>

258
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no use! No use! No use!</font>

259
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is bad.</font>

260
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the boy uses up all his magic, he'll 
be up against the wall instantly.</font>

261
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki!</font>

262
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, then, how about this?</font>

263
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

264
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Blazing Plasma!</font>

265
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's so powerful...</font>

266
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be... Even the highest-ranking 
magic doesn't work.</font>

267
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that all you know how to do?</font>

268
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just about to get serious.</font>

269
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on, keep flailing!</font>

270
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your magic capacity is 
impressive for a human,</font>

271
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the moment it runs out, you're dead!</font>

272
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

273
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That might have worked 
on anyone else but me!</font>

274
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just a man-made magic sword.</font>

275
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like there's only 
so much it can absorb.</font>

276
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the end of you.</font>

277
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just how much magic do you have?!</font>

278
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Storm Blow!</font>

279
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Angering me was a big mistake!</font>

280
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is as far as your 
arrogance will take you!</font>

281
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Die!</font>

282
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

283
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you—</font>

284
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness... I kept you safe...</font>

285
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal!</font>

286
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that was pretty fun.</font>

287
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting yourself killed to defend 
a demon was just brilliant!</font>

288
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up. I won't let 
you get away with this.</font>

289
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure? They're all gonna 
die if you don't protect them!</font>

290
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it!</font>

291
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He got away.</font>

292
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm a fool!</i></font>

293
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I let myself think everything would work 
out as long as I had overpowered magic!</i></font>

294
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is... that form?</font>

295
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki...</font>

296
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A demon?</font>

297
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perfect timing. I'm 
really pissed right now.</font>

298
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A demon hunt sounds like fun.</font>

299
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

300
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it! What the hell are you?!</font>

301
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You robbed one of my men 
of his arm and wings.</font>

302
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your many evil deeds 
warrant certain death.</font>

303
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsk! You're that gargoyle's master, huh?</font>

304
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Demon King was defeated!</font>

305
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How is there still such 
a powerful demon around?!</font>

306
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not done.</font>

307
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Die, damn you!</font>

308
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you gonna do to m—</font>

309
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get it. Killing is 
so much fun, isn't it?</font>

310
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki...</font>

311
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are not worth killing.</font>

312
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're lucky, you might make 
it back to your country.</font>

313
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Screw you!</font>

314
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're gonna regret 
humiliating me like this!</font>

315
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki!</font>

316
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's everyone?</font>

317
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're all safe and sleeping.</font>

318
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good.</font>

319
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're bleeding!</font>

320
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, this? I'm fine.</font>

321
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just ripped out my own horns.</font>

322
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not fine at all!</font>

323
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back.</font>

324
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

325
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to go to Minerva?</font>

326
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please!</font>

327
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to look for a way to heal 
the guardian deity's wounds!</font>

328
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Healing magic can't 
heal wounds like these.</font>

329
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But maybe in Minerva...</font>

330
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true, but monsters 
can't enter Minerva.</font>

331
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I have a good idea.</font>

332
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I changed his appearance with earth magic!</font>

333
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now he doesn't look like a monster!</font>

334
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">T-True...</font>

335
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyone recommended by Cecilia is 
welcome to work in this mansion.</font>

336
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm good at cleaning!</font>

337
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd also like to put this 
statue in the mansion.</font>

338
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

339
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aww!</font>

340
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't put something with 
such poor taste in this house.</font>

341
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take it back.</font>

342
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But...</font>

343
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guardian deity!</font>
