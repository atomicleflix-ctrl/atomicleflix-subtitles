00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. That should do it for today.</font>

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed. Now, Lord Van,
 let us begin your studies.</font>

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? We're starting <i>now</i>?</font>

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's unreasonable after finishing work.</font>

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not know of anyone 
who has died from studying.</font>

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would prove it is not unreasonable.</font>

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's a fiend.</i></font>

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van.</font>

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back. You've already
 returned from hunting?</font>

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, actually...</font>

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please forgive us.</font>

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For what?</font>

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The truth is we discovered 
the entrance to the dungeon.</font>

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? The dungeon?</font>

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, the dungeon?</i></font>

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The thing we were trying to avoid finding?</i></font>

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van.</font>

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If a dungeon has been discovered,
you must report it promptly.</font>

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Send a messenger to the royal capital.</font>

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really don't have a choice, do I?</font>

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Correct.</font>

about the development work.</i></font>

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's our fault.</font>

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive us.</font>

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, now that you've found it,
our hands are tied.</font>

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On that note, I'd like to ask you 
to go report this to the royal capital...</font>

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kusala.</font>

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By <i>myself</i>?</font>

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As the party's scout, 
you discovered the dungeon, didn't you?</font>

31
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How did you know?</font>

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree Kusala's well-suited to the task,
 but we should go with him.</font>

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want the two of you to explore 
the area around the dungeon.</font>

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for your reward...</font>

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How does one large gold sound?</font>

36
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later, Kusala. Take care on
 your solo trip to the royal capital.</font>

37
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Safe travels!</font>

38
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You're being way too mean.</font>

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I <i>do</i> feel bad for you,</font>

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'll give you a mythril short sword.</font>

41
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've used up all the mythril ore,
 so it's kind of precious.</font>

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a good enough reward?</font>

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait! Kusala, switch with me!</font>

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No fair! I'll go instead!</font>

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hey, wait!</font>

47
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the one he asked to do it.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Where are you going?</font>

49
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Take me with you!</font>

50
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sucks for you two, huh, boss?</font>

51
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'm heading out now!</font>

52
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740

82
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flamiria, where were you heading to
in the royal capital?</font>

83
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, my father was a baron, but he died 
in battle and his lands were conquered.</font>

84
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I came to look for work 
as a maid in a noble's house.</font>

85
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, so you're free like me?</font>

86
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

87
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I currently live in a remote village,</font>

88
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if you'd like, 
why don't you come with me?</font>

89
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure there'll be work 
for you to do there, Flamiria.</font>

90
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I can protect you.</font>

91
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't regret it.</font>

92
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Thank you so much for everything.</font>

93
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that a dungeon's been discovered,</font>

94
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I'll build a separate outpost for 
all the adventurers that'll flood here.</font>

95
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An outpost?</font>

96
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A small outpost for the adventurers.</font>

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

98
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, it'd be best to name
a governor for this new outpost.</font>

99
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you will remain in this village,</font>

100
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'll need someone 
to oversee the outpost.</font>

101
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, could I ask you 
to serve as governor?</font>

102
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that will be fine.</font>

103
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should also establish a new chivalric 
order to keep the peace in the outpost.</font>

104
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True.</font>

105
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, Dee's group will be 
the Seatoh Chivalric Order in Seatoh,</font>

106
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we'll establish the Esparda 
Chivalric Order in the new outpost.</font>

107
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this payback?</font>

108
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Payback for what?</font>

109
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm only eight, so I have no idea
 what you're talking about.</font>

110
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pull that rope over there.</font>

111
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

112
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, where should 
we put the materials?</font>

113
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, thanks. Just set them down over there.</font>

114
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thanks to everyone's help,
 it's going well.</i></font>

115
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>At this rate, we might have
the outpost done in a month.</i></font>

116
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to us!</font>

117
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll acquire the necessary
materials this very day!</font>

118
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,890

120
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I could make this group

121
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dee?</font>

122
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes? What is it?</font>

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you headhunt some of these guys
for the Seatoh Chivalric Order?</font>

124
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, interesting idea.</font>

125
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid we were already recruited
 for the Esparda Chivalric Order.</font>

126
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've all signed contracts
 saying we'll join.</font>

127
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

128
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Esparda wasted no time.</i></font>

129
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe he secured men 
before the Seatoh Chivalric Order could.</i></font>

130
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van.</font>

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, Khamsin?</font>

132
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kusala has returned, but, um...</font>

133
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, I filed that report
with the royal capital.</font>

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back.</font>

135
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, who's this?</font>

136
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stuff happened and long story short, she 
had nowhere to go, so I brought her here.</font>

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still accepting residents, right?</font>

138
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. People are more than welcome.</font>

139
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pleasure to meet you.
 I'm the lord of this village, Van.</font>

140
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Flamiria.</font>

141
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kusala rescued me when I was attacked 
by a band of orcs near the royal capital.</font>

142
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, I didn't do much. It was all thanks 
to that shortsword you gave me, Lord Van.</font>

144
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you say.</font>

145
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But to me, you were more wonderful 
than the heroes of legend.</font>

146
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that's what's going on.</i></font>

147
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's the apocalypse.
 The apocalypse is here.</font>

148
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no cause for concern.</font>

149
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh?</font>

150
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're adventurers here for the dungeon.</font>

151
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I told the guild, a bunch of idiots 
hoping to strike it rich set out for here.</font>

152
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-Is that so?</font>

153
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey now. Yer out playin' in 
an awfully lawless place, ain't ya?</font>

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen up, brats. The village may be 
close, but it's dangerous out here.</font>

155
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yer a pretty young filly. A gal like you 
is gonna get attacked by perverts.</font>

156
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So run on home now.</font>

157
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They really are like villains 
in a postapocalyptic world.</i></font>

158
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait.</i></font>

159
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they concerned about us?</font>

160
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like it.</font>

161
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They may lack tact, 
but they seem like nice people.</font>

162
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Their faces are a little scary, though.</font>

163
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did we frighten ya?</font>

164
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our bad.</font>

165
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, what're ya doin'
 all the way out here?</font>

166
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ya'd be in trouble if a monster attacked.</font>

167
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

168
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'll be fine if something shows up
since it's not far to the village.</font>

169
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Village? Where?</font>

170
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Over there.</font>

171
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ya call that a <i>village</i>?</font>

172
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With those huge ramparts?</font>

173
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd they make all that?</font>

174
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll show you.</font>

175
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Buh?</font>

176
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What the...</font>

177
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, this is just temporary fencing, 
so it should do for today.</font>

178
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that freewheelin'
magic just now?!</font>

179
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van! I've brought you
 additional logs.</font>

180
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

181
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Lord Van?</font>

182
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This brat is the Van Nei Fertio 
on everyone's lips in the royal capital?</font>

183
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Brat"?</font>

184
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whichever one of you 
just said that, step forward.</font>

185
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As House Fertio's—no, as Seatoh Chivalric
 Order's commander, I'll punish you!</font>

186
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And who the hell're <i>you</i>?</font>

187
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Any time the mohawk guys saw Dee since,
 they trembled in fear and greeted him.</i></font>

188
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Afternoon, boss!</font>

189
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Workin' hard, I see!</font>

190
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello!</font>

191
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't allow you guys to do anything bad!</font>

192
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yessir!</font>

193
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In contrast to their behavior around Dee,</i></font>

194
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>they seemed amused that
 I was the lord and still just a kid.</i></font>

195
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why're ya in this remote place, Lord Van?</font>

196
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was driven out of my home.</font>

197
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? That's a cryin' shame.</font>

198
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a tough world for nobles, too.</font>

199
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ya know a lotta words, Lord Van.</font>

200
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I am the lord, after all.</font>

201
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? When did we get so many rivals?</font>

202
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Ortho. Did you all just 
get back from the dungeon?</font>

203
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, yeah. We got back a few moments ago.</font>

204
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, Kusala. So you're back, huh?</font>

205
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, who's that woman?</font>

206
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Lady Flamiria. I met her 
on the way to the royal capital.</font>

207
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you.</font>

208
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, we'll go stay in the inn.</font>

209
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

210
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please excuse us.</font>

211
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Are we dreaming?</font>

212
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way.</font>

213
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I should go ahead and build 
a home for Kusala and Flamiria?</font>

214
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? A new home for those two?</font>

215
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

216
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it all!</font>

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So? How was the dungeon?</font>

218
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems there's hardly any monsters
 in the area around it.</font>

219
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, the entrance 
is in a deep crevice,</font>

220
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so it's in a pretty dangerous spot.</font>

221
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A deep crevice?</font>

222
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm, sounds challenging.</font>

223
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it far from the village?</font>

224
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About two to three hours by carriage.</font>

225
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's far!</font>

226
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The natural environment
around most dungeons is harsh.</font>

227
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:57,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So while people could build small bases, 
no one could build anything full-scale.</font>

228
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until now, that is.</font>

229
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's this? She looks like
 she wants to say something.</i></font>

230
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But <i>you</i> could do it, 
couldn't you, Lord Van?</font>

231
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And there it is, Pluriel.</i></font>

232
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the forest's really dangerous.</font>

233
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I also have a curfew, 
so I can't stay out too long.</font>

234
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll protect you.</font>

235
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been to the dungeon 
a few times now, so it isn't dangerous.</font>

236
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But she's not backing down.</i></font>

237
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to enjoy my fun city building here.</i></font>

238
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll have to take me to the dungeon.
I'll need desserts and things for a nap.</font>

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll also bring my attendants, 
Till and Khamsin, as well as Lady Arte.</font>

240
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dee and Esparda have city building
to work on, so they'll stay here.</font>

241
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll also need <i>lots</i>
 of people to escort us.</font>

242
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How's that for an unreasonable request?</i></font>

243
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Who knows what I'd be capable of
if I wasn't eight? Yup, terrifying.</i></font>

244
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood. We'll make the preparations.</font>

245
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can go tomorrow.</font>

246
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?</i></font>

247
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ortho, Van's joining us for some base 
building tomorrow, so let's go prepare.</font>

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, okay. I'll go round up some guards.</font>

249
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?</i></font>

250
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe they're actually
 taking me there.</i></font>

251
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Khamsin?</font>

252
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I feel sick.</font>

253
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who suggested this.</font>

254
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">G-Going to the dungeon.</font>

255
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, lookee!</font>

256
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a giant troll!</font>

257
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'mma kill it!</font>

258
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help!</font>

259
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get it!</font>

260
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Their shouting is so annoying.</i></font>

261
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow.</font>

262
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a lovely view.</font>

263
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. The air is so crisp 
and refreshing, too.</font>

264
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte, look!</font>

265
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a flying monster!</font>

266
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See?</font>

267
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, amazing.</font>

268
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The women seem to be enjoying
 their outing, at least.</i></font>

269
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van. We'll be there 
once we cross here.</font>

270
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop! Hold it!</font>

271
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop right here!</font>

272
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? But we're almost there.</font>

273
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what are you <i>doing</i>?!</font>

274
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}This is one hell of a deep crevice.</font>

275
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

276
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong?</font>

277
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're kidding me, right?</i></font>

278
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Adventurers apparently don't get
the whole concept of "safety first."</i></font>

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's rethink places like this 
where one mistake could mean death.</font>

280
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Predict danger. Manage risk.</font>

281
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it?</font>

282
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there a place like that?</font>

283
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, everyone on your knees.</font>

284
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sit and think about your mistake.</font>

285
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yessir!</font>

286
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, look at this.</font>

287
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you, Kusala, 
hopping about over there...</font>

288
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna try, too, Lord Van? It's fun.</font>

289
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would happen 
if I kicked this log right now?</font>

290
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd die!</font>

291
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kusala may be light on his feet,</font>

292
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the logs could roll or break
 and he'd plummet to his death.</font>

293
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand?</font>

294
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yessir!</font>

295
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, what do you think 
we should do with these logs?</font>

296
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tree-d very carefully.</font>

297
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Cause they're trees.</font>

298
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't build your base.</font>

299
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're sorry!</font>

300
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The correct answer is...</font>

301
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We build a sturdy bridge.</font>

302
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You only cross once you're sure it's safe.</font>

303
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Wow!</font>

304
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, as for this base...</font>

305
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the entrance to the dungeon 
over there? There's not much space.</font>

306
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My first question is:
What kind of facilities should I build?</font>

307
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you all like?</font>

308
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A gambling den!</font>

309
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A tavern!</font>

310
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An amusement park!</font>

311
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rejected.</font>

312
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, anyway, I began building their base.</i></font>

313
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>First, I created a gate 
for the dungeon entrance</i></font>

314
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to stop the dungeon 
monsters getting out.</i></font>

315
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Next, I built a facility for 
the adventurers to stay in.</i></font>

316
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I figured if it was well-made,</i></font>

317
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the adventurers would make 
more headway in the dungeon.</i></font>

318
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The base is finished.</font>

319
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can go inside the building now.</font>

320
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first floor has a rest area
 and a storehouse.</font>

321
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So spacious!</font>

322
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow! We could hold races in here!</font>

323
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second has a cafeteria.</font>

324
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is huge, too.</font>

325
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's have an eatin' competition.</font>

326
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The third has the sleeping area.</font>

327
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beds!</font>

328
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So fluffy.</font>

329
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's have a pillow fight!</font>

330
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa. What a great view.</font>

331
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like I've conquered the world.</font>

332
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I also made a terrace overlooking nature
 to give you all somewhere to relax.</i></font>

333
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impressive work, Lord Van.</font>

334
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now everyone can rest up 
between forays into the dungeon.</font>

335
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plus, I built water tanks 
and rain catchers on the roof.</font>

336
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can use them for the flushing toilets,
 but keep in mind that you can't drink it.</font>

337
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone got that?</font>

338
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yessir.</font>

339
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, clearly not.</i></font>

340
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll leave the management 
of this base in your hands.</font>

341
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please watch over everyone.</font>

342
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger that.</font>

343
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're like spotted eels.</i></font>

344
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you guys! It's getting dark, 
so we need to head back!</font>

345
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw.</font>

346
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My curfew is sunset. We're leaving.</font>

347
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Esparda will be mad at me.</font>

348
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the lord's afraid of somethin'.</font>

349
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, he <i>is</i> a child.</font>

350
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe I should destroy 
this base I just made?</i></font>

351
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Lord Van.</font>

352
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, Arte?</font>

353
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's mythril ore, isn't it?</font>

354
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, no doubt about it. That's mythril.</font>

355
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good job finding it.</font>

356
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're incredible, Arte.</font>

357
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I didn't do much.</font>

358
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>E-Esparda is smiling...</i></font>

360
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,390

361
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,330

364
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,470

365
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I mean!</font>

367
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,350

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,380

371
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,510
