239
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll delete your blog posts 
or rewrite them from the ground up.</font>

240
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They won't let you hang out 
with your friends from back home.</font>

241
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if you start dating someone,</font>

242
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'll sneakily pull strings 
to make you break up.</font>

243
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Do idols not have human rights?</font>

244
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And for some corpo VTubers,</font>

245
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">NDAs ban them from putting their work 
on their resumes after they quit.</font>

246
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They rank pretty low 
on the rights scale, too.</font>

247
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Compared to that, we're pretty easygoing.</font>

248
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you start dating someone, 
we won't meddle as long as you tell us.</font>

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we don't keep tabs 
on who you're in contact with.</font>

250
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When most of your work 
is online like mine,</font>

251
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the "no boys allowed" thing can make 
collabs all but impossible sometimes.</font>

252
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you take all the precautions, 
lots of girls mess up around year three.</font>

253
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The more you restrict them,</font>

254
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the bigger the blowback is 
once the novelty wears off.</font>

255
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not children anymore,</font>

256
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so we won't meddle in your love lives 
if you know where to draw the line,</font>

257
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but talk to us if anything goes wrong.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This bitch!</i></font>

271
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wife grew up in the States, 
and she always says,</font>

272
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"The actors' guilds practically 
hold the reins of showbiz overseas."</font>

273
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But because Japanese agencies 
aren't that powerful,</font>

274
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">actors here have to shut up and do 
whatever the showrunners say.</font>

275
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basically blue-collar workers.</font>

276
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's painfully accurate.</font>

277
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In Hollywood, 
if a production breaks the rules,</font>

278
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the guild hits the studio with a fine.</font>

279
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They ensure actors are so well protected, 
if an audition makes you wait an hour,</font>

280
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you can bill for that time.</font>

281
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, lucky. I wish it were 
like that in Japan, too.</font>

282
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With Japanese movies, the budget doesn't 
trickle down to the actual productions.</font>

283
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The distributors have too much power.</font>

284
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Internal politics, ageism, 
connections, and agency clout have created</font>

285
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">an environment where projects only get 
greenlit with proven box-office stars.</font>

286
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's unsustainable.</font>

287
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Japan cares far too little 
about actual acting ability.</font>

288
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it'd change with a guild monitoring 
auditions like they do over there.</font>

289
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But as things stand now, 
we won't develop good actors.</font>

290
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really care about the actors, huh?</font>

291
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why wouldn't I?</font>

292
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to make good films, 
and I can't do that without good actors.</font>

293
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to bring 
real change to this industry.</font>

296
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And besides...</i></font>

297
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear!</font>

298
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Models who get into film are so 
demanding when they can't even act!</font>

299
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say it louder!</font>

300
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}One of them made the bus come 
all the way to their front door,</font>

301
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's the right amount of bitchy.</i></font>

302
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I feel like I'm in the acting world 
for the first time in ages.</i></font>

303
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}started complaining to their 
makeup artist about their coactors,</font>

304
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can discuss art and acting</i></font>

305
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}and basically ruined the mood on set.</font>

306
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and listen to drunks moan 
about bad shoots and coworkers.</i></font>

307
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I really want to come back here.</i></font>

308
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see,</font>

309
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to bring about an era where 
real actors like you are valued.</font>

310
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want my next film to make full use 
of the skills of people like that.</font>

311
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There it is.</i></font>

312
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Are you saying you'll cast me in it?</font>

313
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, I'm not sure about that yet.</font>

314
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd be a shame if we worked together 
and wound up having creative differences.</font>

315
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'd like to get to know you 
better before I decide.</font>

316
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to know what's inside you—
your soul? Your philosophy?</font>

317
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My philosophy?</font>

318
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me. It's almost time.</font>

319
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. Thank you.</font>

320
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to take this elsewhere, 
but I can't drag a kid around so late.</font>

321
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's fine.</font>
