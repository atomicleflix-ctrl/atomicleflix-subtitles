00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, dear. Listen closely.</font>

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you need to eradicate are the ones
who are trying to plunder from us.</font>

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, dear. That's why you shall fight.</font>

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that you can take your 
mother back someday.</font>

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You filthy spellcaster!</font>

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Oh...</font>

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're missing quite 
a lot deep down there.</font>

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me tell you something interesting.</font>

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those spellcasters that were repeatedly
calling you guys "You, dear"...</font>

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They all died, okay?</font>

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}If you still want to keep living...</font>

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}come with me.</font>

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, and... about your mother.</font>

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's long since died in 
a country called Japan.</font>

15
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me tell you once again.</font>

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This operation is to recreate 
a Magecraft ritual...</font>

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}that was once held in the Far East.</font>

18
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We fished up six Masters and their Servants
using a fake Holy Grail War as the lure.</font>

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will use them as 
catalysts to officially</font>

20
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">summon seven Servants, and the real...</font>

21
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}the True Holy Grail War will commence.</font>

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a Master of the True Holy Grail War...</font>

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will have you summon a Servant.</font>

24
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the summon succeeds—</font>

25
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to report 
to me what showed up!</font>

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do whatever you want
after it's summoned, too!</font>

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, you can even consider
coming after my life!</font>

28
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please make sure to report to me.</font>

29
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this has nothing to 
do with the job, but...</font>

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The wish granter that can make
any wish come true...</font>

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will you wish upon the Holy Grail?</font>

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have any wishes.</font>

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have a god to believe in
or a homeland to return to.</font>

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I desire are meals 
and good sleep each day.</font>

35
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't expect the favorite...</font>

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you kept talking about 
to be a boy like him.</font>

37
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. He looks like 
a boy because they fiddled</font>

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with his body too much when he was young.</font>

39
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He probably can't live that long a life.</font>

40
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though, he's not the type
to worry about stuff like that.</font>

41
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the reason why you didn't prepare
a catalyst for him?</font>

42
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had a lightbulb moment.</font>

43
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I made a fake Holy Grail choose
a Servant for someone who has nothing...</font>

44
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what exactly...</font>

45
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would be drawn to it?</font>

46
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>For the elements, silver and iron.</i></font>

47
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>For the foundation, stone
and the Archduke of Contracts.</i></font>

48
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why I want you,
who doesn't have anything!</i></font>

49
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No desires for the world,
no intention of leaving anything behind!</i></font>

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>With someone like you,
the Holy Grail can enter a plain state.</i></font>

51
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just what will...</i></font>

52
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>come to you?</i></font>

53
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Come forth from the circle of binding...</i></font>

54
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Guardian of the Scales!</i></font>

55
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, you're a Master of the Holy Grail War?</font>

56
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hah!</font>

57
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How this face lacks ambition.</font>

58
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am indeed the Master who summoned you.</font>

59
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can call me "Captain."</font>

60
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that will soon become meaningless.</font>

61
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who exactly are you?</font>

62
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My boy, you have a misunderstanding.</font>

63
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were not...</font>

64
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">summoned by you.</font>

65
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

66
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are nothing more than shadows
of the Heroic Spirit you summoned.</font>

67
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are not Heroic Spirits.</font>

68
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're outta luck, man.</font>

69
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't escape now.</font>

70
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have summoned a hardship
that has no way out.</font>

71
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

72
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we have high hopes for you.</font>

73
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That you will become a Lancer
that pierces through all.</font>

74
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

75
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you lot not the Lancer?</font>

76
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Fuyuki's system was used as is,</font>

77
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lancer would have been the 
one rightfully summoned.</font>

78
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, what in the world...</font>

79
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see.</font>

80
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A guardian whose job is to always look
down on us from a high place...</font>

81
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess you could say... "Watcher."</font>

82
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up already!</font>

83
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Now, whatcha gonna do?</font>

84
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Cordelion?</font>

85
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bazdilot!</font>

86
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing
to a member of the family?</font>

87
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A fly.</font>

88
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait—</font>

89
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you thought you could infiltrate
with a disguise like that...</font>

90
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that's a great insult to Mr. Scradio.</font>

91
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No way! Spies?</font>

92
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Come to the basement
once you're done cleaning up.</font>

93
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I received a catalyst from the States.</font>

94
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will summon a Servant.</font>

95
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bazdilot Cordelion.</font>

96
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His public face is the president
of an industrial waste disposal company.</font>

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His hidden side is a high-ranking member</font>

98
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">of the Scradio Family, 
a huge mafia group...</font>

99
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that is very close
to a portion of the government.</font>

100
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are over 125 murders
that he is suspected of involvement.</font>

101
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">During his first incarceration,</font>

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">three wardens and 26 inmates
went missing in six months.</font>

103
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He painted the entire penitentiary
into allies of the Scradio Family.</font>

104
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am still against it.</font>

105
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking someone
with so many enemies out of jail...</font>

106
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to weave him into the Holy Grail War.</font>

107
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say that, but all the Masters I called
are kinda similar, you know!</font>

108
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Masters can all be controlled
however we wish.</font>

109
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

110
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you and Bazdilot Cordelion 
are a different story.</font>

111
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what do you think will happen?</font>

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, he's trying to summon
the great virtuous, unyielding hero...</font>

113
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heracles!</font>

114
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you the one...</font>

115
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that will become my master
and present me a labor?</font>

116
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one who decides that 
isn't me. That's you.</font>

117
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I shall ask you, as well.</font>

118
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O hero of Greece.</font>

119
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Can you take the life of a young child
if it meant winning the war?</font>

120
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you...</font>

121
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">testing me?</font>

122
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you speak of such
knowing my background...</font>

123
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will deem those words
as something you risk your life for.</font>

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

125
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have already...</font>

126
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">thrown my life away long ago.</font>

127
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How facile.</font>

128
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Restraints from Command Spells
are meaningless to me.</font>

129
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I order you with a Command Spell.</font>

130
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Drop your facade.</font>

131
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bastard!</font>

132
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you...</font>

133
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need a hero.</font>

134
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need human obsession that uses
any means necessary to meet an objective.</font>

135
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impossible!</font>

144
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I further command you.</font>

149
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it really all right?</font>

150
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, to hand him that thing

158
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,390

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Alcides.</font>

162
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will have my vengeance

163
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and using the power of the Holy Grail...</font>

164
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will rid myself...</font>

168
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ridiculous.</font>

169
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I am simply using you for my vengeance.</font>

170
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But tell me. What is the source
of your Magical Energy?</font>

171
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even after such a fierce battle,
I did not feel it ever flicker.</font>

172
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is not the Magical Energy level
of an ordinary Mage.</font>

173
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite simple.</font>

174
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am using batteries.</font>

175
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the past...</font>

181
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that runs on human lives, huh?</font>

182
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With this much, I'll 
have no issues fighting</font>

183
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">at full throttle for about half a day.</font>

184

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Half a day with this much?</font>

185
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then...</font>

186
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you should be able to continue fighting
with all you've got for several months.</font>

187
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many humans have you sacrificed
to this contraption until now?</font>

188
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Oh...</font>

189
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">just 24,976 people.</font>

190
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surprising you were able 
to keep it a secret.</font>

191
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

192
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is all thanks to my lord
Galvarosso Scradio's connections.</font>

193
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bigger the Scradio Family gets,
the more enemies we have.</font>

194
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we have to eradicate them anyway...</font>

195
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we should make good use of them.</font>

196
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate that you 
stopped their squabbles...</font>

197
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we'll be in trouble
if you don't hold your reins properly.</font>

twice or so in the past.</font>

201
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yep! It hurt quite a bit, you know!</i></font>

202
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I cannot understand it.</font>

203
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why the government decided
to join forces with you</font>

204
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even if it has been several decades...</font>

205
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or you, who has the nerve
to join forces with a government...</font>

206
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,000

217
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that why you became

218
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yep, yep!</i></font>

225
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,430

233
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that.</font>

239
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't this where you welcome me

240
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did some work immediately

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and even eat in this condition.</font>

268
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sleep and meals are more 
important than anything.</font>

269
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are slightly different
from those Extra Class folks.</font>

270
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I tell you?</font>

271
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who will become Lancer.</font>

272
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watcher is the barrier and watchtower
for that to happen.</font>

273
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it absurd to say
that a human will become Lancer?</font>

274
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is absurd is this 
Holy Grail War itself.</font>

275
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has derailed all too far.</font>

276
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those that normally would not be summoned
are calling for each other...</font>

277
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and more will be drawn over to this land.</font>

278
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Those parents have not shown up
for two days now.</i></font>

279
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsubaki...</font>

280
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right.</font>

281
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will never abandon you.</font>

282
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this a tattoo?</font>

283
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was this here before?</font>

284
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you pull this bird out, as well?</font>

285
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you! I love animals!</font>

286
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love!</font>

287
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, Mr. Black...</font>

288
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">nobody will disappear anymore, right?</font>

289
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody will disappear anymore, right?</font>

290
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yes! I'm sorry!</font>

291
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Thank you so much.</font>

292
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodbye.</font>

293
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor wasted two hours of his time
because of me.</font>

294
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see the reason why you admire
your mentor so much.</font>

295
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He is a magnificent 
instructor of Magecraft.</font>

296
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking into account the tale that 
he survived a Holy Grail War,</font>

297
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he must also be top-notch as a Mage.</font>

298
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course! Professor has solved
all sorts of cases for the Clock Tower—</font>

299
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong, Master?</font>

300
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fog is rather thick.</font>

301
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?
There isn't any fog anywhere—</font>

302
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Berserker, we might 
be in a bit of trouble.</font>

303
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This fog... has at least
swallowed up the entire city.</font>

304
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will happen to me now?</font>

305
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From hereon out,</font>

306
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">an assortment of difficulties you may
call "trials" will stand in your way.</font>

307
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By overcoming them,
you will slowly become someone.</font>

308
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am a mere soldier with no name.</font>

309
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will not amount to "a somebody,"
even to death.</font>

310
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll see about that.</font>

311
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That just means that you 
can become anything.</font>

312
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Escape the jaws of death, young man.</font>

313
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rage against God.</font>

314
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never submit.</font>

315
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beyond all that
is where the proof of your life will be.</font>

316
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See...</font>

317
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}your first trial has already arrived.</font>

318
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you a Mage seeking the Holy Grail?</font>

319
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you...</font>

320
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a Servant?</font>

321
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Answer my question.</font>

322
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on. I have no hostile intent.</font>

323
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you allow me
to negotiate with your Master?</font>

324
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jump.</font>

325
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have some hair coming your way.</font>

326
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Zabaniya.</i></font>

327
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a Master.</font>

328
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a poor little girl
who got roped into the Holy Grail War.</font>

329
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get away!</font>

330
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you stay here...</font>
