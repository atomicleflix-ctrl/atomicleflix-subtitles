<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be. That's impossible.</font>

131
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're a fake Assault...</font>

132
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a doppelganger!</font>

133
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you put it that way, yes.</font>

134
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But nay!</font>

135
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am not the me who would be 
shaken by wanton lewdness!</font>

136
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Absolutely not!</font>

137
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the true form
I was meant to be: Assault!</font>

138
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's the man who kept 
following Tamaki around?</font>

139
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Assault was that nobody who got taken 
out by Tamaki's lecher lure, right?</font>

140
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the battle in the Nether, if Assault's 
powers had activated properly,</font>

141
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he would have annihilated the 8th.</font>

142
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My arrows don't work against him.</font>

143
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Tamaki's sensuality doesn't affect him,
then there is no one who can stop him!</font>

144
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, please stand back!</font>

145
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explosion...</font>

146
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noto, reporting from the 
2nd! I've come to assist!</font>

147
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why, Juggernaut?</font>

148
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have permission from Captain Honda!</font>

149
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said, "The 8th's shorthanded, 
so go and help!"</font>

150
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're grateful for the relief.</font>

151
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An increase of one person 
poses no problem.</font>

152
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come at me. I'll take you all on.</font>

153
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maki and I will create an opening!</font>

154
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hinawa, back us up with your sniping!</font>

155
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You three will follow Hinawa's attacks!</font>

156
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even for Assault, if it's one-on-six 
against this fighting capacity...</i></font>

157
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go!</font>

158
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Into battle!</font>

159
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,960
<font face="Times New Roman" size="20"><b><font size="20">Fire Force</font></b></font>

160
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,960

163
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,140

164
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Instantly?</font>

165
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You traitor.</font>

166
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man over there...</font>

167
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not a member of the 8th, are you?</font>

168
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let you go. Leave.</font>

169
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do that!</font>

170
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abandoning those precious 
to me and running?</font>

171
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what a fire soldier does!</font>

172
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you not see what just happened?</font>

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have no chance of winning.</font>

174
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that!</font>

175
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In this moment, when the Great 
Cataclysm is moving to end the world,</font>

176
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this life of mine may end at any moment, 
so I don't want to have any regrets!</font>

177
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will protect the one I love!</font>

178
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Juggernaut...</font>

179
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kotatsu-san, if the world is saved...</font>

180
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">please go on a date with me!</font>

181
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You die now!</font>

182
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of love on the battlefield? 
How soft and weak can you be?</font>

183
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have no right to stand 
on the field of battle!</font>

184
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamaki Kotatsu, you're the only one left.</font>

185
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your lewdness will not work on me. 
You have no means of winning.</font>

186
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up!</font>

187
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no use.</font>

188
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I commend that resilience of yours.</font>

189
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

190
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not acknowledge eros!</font>

191
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now a derrière attack? It won't work.</font>

192
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamaki!</font>

193
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What an indecent fire soldier!</font>

194
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that girl doing?</font>

195
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has she no shame?</font>

196
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shameless.</font>

197
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could that be the only skill she has?</font>

198
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a disgrace to all women.</font>

199
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From this point forward, I will not allow 
you to expose your bottom or your chest!</font>

200
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Truly problematic.</font>

201
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a vulgar woman.</font>

202
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}She can't do anything 
other than flash her skin?</font>

203
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's worthless.</font>

204
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a fire soldier! 
Why is she just lazing around?</font>

205
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are they... Tamaki is fighting 
for the sake of the people!</font>

206
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mobs just get swept along. Now that it's 
come this far, there's no stopping it.</font>

207
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tatsuto, you mustn't look at that.</font>

208
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prepare yourself, Tamaki Kotatsu!</font>

209
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will kill you, and eros 
will vanish with you!</font>

210
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eros is necessary!</font>

211
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That voice...</font>

212
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You lost to eros. Why are you here?</font>

213
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real Assault!</font>

214
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of your worldly desires, 
eros has appeared again!</font>

215
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assault!</font>

216
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tatsuto! I told you not to look!</font>

217
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a disgrace to women! 
Just disappear!</font>

218
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a bad influence on the children!</font>

219
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. You're Haijima Senior 
Researcher Yoshida-san.</font>

220
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're Licht-kun.</font>

221
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that female fire soldier a 
combatant from your company?</font>

222
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is all that?</font>

223
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean? It's just 
her involuntary lewdness.</font>

224
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamaki is fighting her hardest!</font>

225
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You moron!</font>

226
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no such thing as "Lucky Lecher"!</font>

227
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's tricking you, that's all!</font>

228
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is the Lucky Lecher Lure?</font>

229
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must have something to do 
with her role in this world.</font>

230
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You're a disgrace to all women!</font>

231
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Up until now, I thought Soldier 
Tamaki was just clumsy, but...</font>

232
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You're a disgrace to all women!</font>

233
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What a vulgar woman!</font>

234
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're disgusting!</font>

235
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit your complaining.</font>

236
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you hate sexy stuff that much,</font>

237
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then let me show you...</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the weight of eros!</font>

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you dress like 
that in front of children?!</font>

241
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You despicable whore!</font>

242
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you no shame as a woman?!</font>

243
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up, you damned hag!</font>

246
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop talking!</font>

247
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that, Licht-kun?! 
Can you believe her?!</font>

248
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're asking me?</font>

249
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why aren't you saying anything?!</font>

250
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a stupid woman with no talent 
for anything other than stripping!</font>

251
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because she's young and cute,</font>

252
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she thinks that if she strips, 
everything will work out!</font>

253
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's bad because Soldier Tamaki 
is cute and has a nice body?</font>

254
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Exactly!</font>

255
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That only people with nice figures get
complimented for their looks isn't fair!</font>

256
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mama, what you're saying 
doesn't make sense.</font>

257
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

258
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that cute soldier with the nice 
figure has to be considerate of others,</font>

259
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then doesn't everyone who's exceptional 
have to be considerate of others, too?</font>

260
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In sports, we'd have to let people 
who suck play as regulars,</font>

261
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and universities would have

262
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're an elite researcher at Haijima.</font>

263
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're smarter than other people. 
You're exceptional, right?</font>

264
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if someone wanted to be a researcher</font>

265
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and couldn't because they 
weren't smart enough,</font>

266
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this means you'd have to give up your 
spot as a researcher to them, right?</font>

267
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your mama worked very hard to get smart!</font>

268
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's different from someone 
who was just born good-looking!</font>

269
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We aren't the same!</font>

270
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting smarter is a talent, too.</font>

271
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are tons of people in this world 
who don't even know how to study.</font>

272
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you're not one of them,
you must have been born smart.</font>

273
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And also...</font>

274
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that lady soldier's 
toned body is beautiful.</font>

275
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

276
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The beauty of that body is the result 
of daily training, of diligent work.</font>

277
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop that right now, Tatsuto!</font>

278
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. I'm Tatsuto.</font>

279
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hearing the words of the captain 
of the 8th earlier awakened me.</font>

280
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that I think about it, Mama...</font>

281
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what's your name again?</font>

282
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

283
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could it be that you're</font>

284
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">someone who doesn't think 
and just gets swept along</font>

285
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">by the info you get on the spot?</font>

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just part of the mob?</font>

288
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Licht-kun! Something's wrong with Tatsuto!</font>

289
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all that female soldier's fault!</font>

290
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because he saw that!</font>

291
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true. It's just as Tatsuto-kun says.</font>

292
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and I are supposed to be colleagues,</font>

293
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but other than the fact that 
you're Tatsuto-kun's mother,</font>

294
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't recall anything.</font>

295
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She vanished?</font>

296

298
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A part of the mob who was granted a name.</font>

299
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've become a World-Builder 
capable of thought.</font>

300
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mob is meant to cause a fuss 
and burn, and nothing more.</font>

301
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamaki-san, do your best to show that 
these flames can be extinguished.</font>

302
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamaki Kotatsu.</font>

303
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By stripping off the veneer, 
you've grown even sexier.</font>

304
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate it, but when people reject me that 
much, it makes me want to fight back.</font>

305
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stand proud! Thanks to you, 
I've awakened to eros.</font>

306
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

307
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eros is not needed!</font>

308
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sensuality is not something 
to be exhibited publicly!</font>

309
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying sexual desire 
should hide in the shadows?</font>

310
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying everyone 
should become a perv like me?</font>

311
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there is nothing sexy, what will become
of children who know nothing of eros?</font>

312
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's always bothered me.</font>

313
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This seemingly supernatural phenomenon 
of the Lucky Lecher Lure.</font>

314
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra-kun is a hero.</font>

315
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander Sho is an angel.</font>

316
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And just as Captain Obi has a role 
as the light that guides everyone,</font>

317
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she is a symbol of life.</font>

318
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a hope that ties us to the future.</font>

319
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eros is not necessary!</font>

320
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sexual desire is exactly what we need!</font>

321
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were defeated by eros!</font>

322
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you say is no more than 
an excuse for that defeat!</font>

323
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assault!</font>

324
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true that there was a time when I 
thought I had been overpowered by eros.</font>

325
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I realized that at the same time, 
I'd gained tremendous vitality.</font>

326
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once, all I could do 
was kill my opponents.</font>

327
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But through sensuality, 
I became able to feel the future!</font>

328
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It did that much for you?</font>

329
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will defeat you!</font>

330
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I will protect all the 
lewdness in this world!</font>

331
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will not let you have your way!</font>

332
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will not fold before anything but eros!</font>

333
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assault...</font>

334
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,150

336
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has no future!</font>

337
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Life...</font>

338
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,120

339
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,470

342
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the situation?</font>

343
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

344
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is happening here?</font>

345
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maki! This is no time to be sleeping!</font>

346
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain...</font>

347
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's it, Tamaki! Go!</font>

348
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lieutenant, too?!</font>

349
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

350
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamaki! Go!</font>

351
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you two do?!</font>

352
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sexual desire is hope!</font>

353
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's beautiful and cool! 
Why do you reject it?</font>

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,050

355
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,910

357
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is no mere accident!</font>

358
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You... perv.</font>

359
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,370
