2
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

3
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just woke up.</font>

4
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

5
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you instantly attack me?</font>

6
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are the rules this time?</font>

7
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Answer me.</font>

8
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just woke up, you know.</font>

9
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know anything about this game.</font>

10
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me what you know.</font>

11
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you really just wake up?</font>

12
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not with the girls in the entryway?</font>

13
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I said. What entryway?</font>

14
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me what's going on.</font>

15
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

16
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can discuss those details later.</font>

17
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll find us if we stay here.</font>

18
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you come with me?</font>

19
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

20
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody suspicious.</font>

21
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where did you come from?</font>

22
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just a humble—</font>

23
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma-chan! I'm so glad you're alive!</font>

24
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, dummy! 
Don't open it until I'm finished!</font>

25
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Are you hurt?</font>

26
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma!</font>

27
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma!</font>

28
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone...</font>

29
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

30
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just came back for allies. Right?</font>

31
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was... scared.</font>

32
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?</font>

33
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, who is she?</font>

34
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Yuki-san. You're her, aren't you?</font>

35
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An incredibly skilled 
ghost-like veteran player.</font>

36
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard of her before.</font>

37
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone that incredible 
is willing to help us?</font>

38
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since everyone's here, 
let's introduce ourselves.</font>

39
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Yuki.</font>

40
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you.</font>

41
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is an escape game.</font>

42
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The game's probably beaten 
by using those to escape the bath.</font>

43
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's a limited number of tags.</font>

44
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

45
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuki-san, if you'd woken up sooner 
and didn't have a tag,</font>

46
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what would you have done?</font>

47
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd start by looking for the exit.</font>

48
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if you reached the entryway 
and realized you needed a tag,</font>

49
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would you go back to look for one?</font>

50
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'd wait at the exit 
for a player with a tag.</font>

51
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fighting every other player would 
be inefficient, so I'd form a team.</font>

52
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how the entryway team formed, too.</font>

53
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't leave without 
one tag for each person,</font>

54
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so both players and tags 
accumulate in the entryway, but...</font>

55
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thirty people is probably the cutoff.</font>

56
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd you come up with that number?</font>

57
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judging by the number of shower stalls, 
there are fifty participants.</font>

58
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Considering the average survival rate 
and tags that have already been used,</font>

59
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">about thirty more people can escape.</font>

60
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the upper limit to the size of a team.</font>

61
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Isn't that amazing?</font>

62
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yeah.</font>

63
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The players still here are 
the slow starters, aren't they?</font>

64
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many tags do we have?</font>

66
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nine, I think.</font>

67
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a lot. The entryway team 
hasn't come for them?</font>

68
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not yet.</font>

69
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's hard for them to get us in here.</font>

70
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

71
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That door we used earlier is the only exit, 
and there's a wall back there.</font>

72
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They can't get behind us.</font>

73
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not a bad spot to defend.</font>

74
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me...</font>

75
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on.</font>

76
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That...</font>

77
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sugiyama is our treasurer. 
Could you give that to her?</font>

78
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

79
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

80
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mishiro-san, Mishiro-san.</font>

81
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mishiro-san will praise me.</font>

82
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mishiro-san!</font>

83
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it, I did it, I did it!</font>

84
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got three!</font>

85
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They asked to join us now, 
so I pummeled them!</font>

86
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, Riko.</font>

87
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could I get the usual for three?</font>

88
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Again?</font>

89
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, please.</font>

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love how cold your 
right hand is, Mishiro-san.</font>

91
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All done.</font>

92
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? But I brought back 
enough for three people.</font>

93
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I do next?</font>

94
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Attack the enemy's position?</font>

95
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's wait and see a little longer.</font>

96
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mishiro-san...</font>

97
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our strategy is to hit and run.</font>

98
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma and I will fight at the front.</font>

99
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like the rest of you to support us.</font>

100
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have roughly thirty enemies,</font>

101
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it should end once we 
defeat about half of them.</font>

102
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If every remaining player can use a tag, 
the smart thing to do is to make a deal.</font>

103
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They must know that, too.</font>

104
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's prepare as much as we can 
so we can all survive.</font>

105
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These are all the knives?</font>

106
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

107
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any mirrors nearby?</font>

108
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think there are some around the large bath.</font>

109
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But getting lost would be dangerous.</font>

110
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amon, we've got a job for you.</font>

111
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a left. Cross here and go right.</font>

112
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then take another left.</font>

113
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's impressive.</font>

114
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

115
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

116
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh, sure.</font>

117
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's how you smile, Amon-chan.</font>

118
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's cute.</font>

119
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

120
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, did we go too far?</font>

121
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. It's above us.</font>

122
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

123
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This should be enough, right?</font>

124
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

125
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Where's Hiwada?</font>

126
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She went to powder her nose.</font>

127
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

128
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma.</font>

129
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where did she go?</font>

130
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were looking for someone.</font>

131
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

132
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hiwada-san...</font>

133
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There she is!</font>

134
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn. Hey!</font>

135
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shit. Wait!</font>

136
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Think, think, think.</i></font>

137
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</font>

138
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Think, think, think.</i></font>

139
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

140
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a left. Cross here and go right.</font>

141
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

142
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then take another left.</font>

143
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way!</font>

144
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

145
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn!</font>

146
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So many! Now we can make 
enough for everyone.</font>

147
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're amazing, Amon-san.</font>

148
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Amon.</font>

149
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't do anything.</font>

150
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're always so modest.</font>

151
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Apparently, her leg's not that bad off.</font>

152
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

153
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're amazing, Amon. 
You should be more confident.</font>

154
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}That's good.</font>

155
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

156
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

157
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stick your chest out. Yeah, that's it.</font>

158
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think it's a hot spring?</font>

159
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This bath, I mean.</font>

160
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think so.</font>

161
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it is.</font>

162
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can feel it working.</font>

163
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she was in that area,</font>

164
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she was probably collecting shards of 
mirrors and things to use as weapons.</font>

165
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did she tell you that?</font>

166
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, um...</font>

167
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She got away.</font>

168
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

169
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. A player we'd never seen 
before came to her rescue.</font>

170
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right! Someone new 
seems to have joined them.</font>

171
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She suddenly showed up 
and then vanished like a ghost.</font>

172
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true. We looked for her 
but couldn't find any trace of her.</font>

173
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A ghost?</font>

174
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're all good girls, aren't they?</font>

175
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

176
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you in this business?</font>

177
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To beat 99 games.</font>

178
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's my goal.</font>

179
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you?</font>

180
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? I, uh... For normal reasons.</font>

181
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Normal?</font>

182
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. I guess it's not normal.</font>

183
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think a girl as masculine as me 
does well in the real world?</font>

184
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think there's anything wrong with it.</font>

185
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's better than people who refer 
to themselves in the third person.</font>

186
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you're right.</font>

187
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder why.</font>

188
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like I can't wear 
my uniform, act amiably,</font>

189
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and talk more like a girl.</font>

190
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It shouldn't cause me any pain.</font>

191
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But once I started thinking about it, 
I struggled to talk to friends,</font>

192
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:07,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">go to school, leave the house, 
eat with my family,</font>

193
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or do anything at all.</font>

194
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Slitting someone's throat 
and killing them is easier.</font>

195
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll release you from this game.</font>

196
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

197
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help you find a decent job so you 
don't have to play this dangerous game.</font>

198
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you say if I proposed that?</font>

199
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma, I—</font>

200
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd smack you.</font>

201
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

202
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're here.</font>

203
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Azuma.</font>

204
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good luck to us both.</font>

205
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

206
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

207
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are a bunch of people 
on the other side of the wall!</font>

208
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why?</i></font>

209
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why didn't I notice?</i></font>

210
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why didn't I check?</i></font>

211
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The game is set in a public bath.</i></font>

212
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why didn't I even consider that possibility?</i></font>

213
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I could've noticed long before now.</i></font>

214
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't even use the Wall of Thirty
as an excuse.</i></font>

215
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't believe it.</i></font>

216
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't believe it.</i></font>

217
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't believe it.</i></font>
