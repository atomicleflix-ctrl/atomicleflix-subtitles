1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been summoned
by an investigative committee?</font>

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Deborah Darkian, is it?</font>

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I summon you to the Starlight Room 
at the Grand Merillian for investigation.</font>

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't legally enforceable. 
I don't see why you should play along.</font>

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I take it you're going?</font>

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm certain there's much more
 I need to learn.</font>

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know what they call 
Deborah's investigative committee?</font>

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their gatherings are famous, 
but no one knows what transpires there.</font>

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one will breathe a word.</font>

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it has acquired the name...</font>

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Silent Ladies' Tea Party.</font>

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome, Constance Grail.</font>

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see your head is still attached.</font>

15
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">While I assume you're aware,</font>

16
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you are not to speak of anything
 that happens here.</font>

17
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you still wish to proceed?</font>

18
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't be a problem.</font>

19
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These three are Deborah's hangers-on.</font>

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The thing is, I received a letter 
from your friend, Pamela Francis.</font>

21
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From Pamela?</font>

22
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The poor dear. I hear her hair 
has turned white as snow.</font>

23
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she wrote saying that 
nothing you did broke the law.</font>

24
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you see, someone else 
must step in to review your crimes.</font>

25
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My</i> crimes?</font>

26
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We mean to say we'll do you 
the honor of judging you.</font>

27
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wouldn't want to end up like 
Scarlett Castiel, now would you?</font>

28
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett?</font>

29
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was simply dreadful.</font>

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That face she was so proud of,
rolling through the mud like some toy...</font>

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone—yes, even the most lowly—
clapped and laughed and jeered.</font>

32
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know <i>I</i> could never bear the shame 
of such an ignominious end.</font>

33
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think you're doing?
 Holding my hand?</font>

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Up till now, we've switched 
so she could save me.</i></font>

35
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But not this time.</i></font>

36
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're going...</i></font>

37
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to fight together!</i></font>

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a tawdry farce,
 but I'll play along.</font>

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I beg your pardon?</font>

40
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you hear me? Listen well.</font>

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said that I...</font>

42
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that <i>we</i> are going to judge <i>you</i>!</font>

43
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

44
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Earl John Doe Ball must have been 
quite a blow to you, Deborah Darkian.</font>

45
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You speak of the dancing children?</font>

46
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With all due respect, it was I 
who reported them to the Security Force.</font>

47
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To think we had human 
traffickers in our midst!</font>

48
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mere thought makes my blood run cold.</font>

49
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And why did everyone there 
have ties to the Darkians, I wonder?</font>

50
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take the Marquess of McLain, 
who looked so friendly with the slavers.</font>

51
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Esther,</font>

52
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean your husband.</font>

53
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt he'll be able to avoid prison.</font>

54
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then again,</font>

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he may receive a lighter sentence 
if he were to name the ringleader.</font>

56
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely you know of my fiancé's position.</font>

57
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Depending on your testimony, I would 
be happy to put in a good word with him.</font>

58
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

59
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've as good as won.</font>

60
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I leave the rest to you.</font>

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Scarlett.</font>

62
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Marchioness of McLain must know 
Deborah Darkian had a hand in the crime.</i></font>

63
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I can get her to attest to that...</i></font>

64
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ladies.</font>

65
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear something just now?</font>

66
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that reminds me.</font>

67
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wasn't the Marquess of McLain 
just about to leave the country?</font>

68
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I wrong, Esther?</font>

69
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won't be back for some time, will he?</font>

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's right.</font>

71
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's going on?</i></font>

72
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still don't see?</font>

73
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you seriously imagine a viscount's 
daughter could crush a Darkian?</font>

74
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, I think it's time we took a vote.</font>

75
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who should be judged here, you or me?</font>

76
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This isn't good.
Under the circumstances...</i></font>

77
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, if you bend the knee 
to me like a good little girl,</font>

78
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might decide Pamela 
was only imagining things.</font>

79
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare she?!</font>

80
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, have you anything 
to say for yourself?</font>

81
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... I...</font>

82
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,980

83
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

84
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">don't agree with your methods one jot!</font>

88
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, hello there! Do pardon the intrusion.</font>

89
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly.</font>

90
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They kept pestering me about formalities,
and now look how late it's gotten!</font>

91
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How rude of you to barge in uninvited,</font>

119
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yesterday, he came calling at my house

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, didn't you know?</font>

136
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man she was having
an affair with broke it off,</font>

137
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she tried to kill him
when she took her own life.</font>

138
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean she's...</font>

139
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But enough about that! How do you 
and your fiancé, Randolph Ulster—</font>

140
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Don't you think that's enough, Amelia?</font>

141
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aldous!</font>

142
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:45,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The editor in chief said he'd demote you 
if you do any more unscheduled interviews.</font>

143
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Until next time, Constance Grail!</font>

144
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have every faith 
you'll answer sincerely, of course!</font>

145
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she's a reporter?</font>

146
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good grief.</font>

147
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please forgive me colleague.</font>

148
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no need.</font>

149
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Aldous Clayton, 
with the Mayflower Company.</font>

150
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do let me know if Amelia 
causes you any more bother.</font>

151
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you.</font>

152
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that about?</font>

153
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just think of her as a cat 
that happened to scratch at you.</font>

154
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Miss C., the daughter of a viscount,
emulates the infamous Scarlett Castiel."</font>

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"She indulges in now-banned hallucinogens
and spends her days in wild orgies."</font>

156
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nonsense! Awful hogwash!</font>

157
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, of course it is.</font>

158
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a shame. And here I was, looking up
 to Amelia Hobbes as a role model.</font>

159
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A role model? Her?</font>

160
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I tell you?</font>

161
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My dream is to stay unmarried
 and become a reporter.</font>

162
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it really?</font>

163
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You told me yourself.</font>

164
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always been obsessed 
with chasing rumors,</font>

165
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so you said, "If you enjoy it so, 
why not become a reporter?"</font>

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one else would suggest such a thing 
to me at the time, even as a joke.</font>

167
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It felt like you truly saw me. 
I was delighted.</font>

168
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

169
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, you're having tea with 
Crown Princess Cecilia later, right?</font>

170
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I expect a juicy scoop!</font>

171
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right...</font>

172
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I have a moment of your time?</font>

173
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I represent the Ladies' Committee 
of the Violet Association.</font>

174
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kimberly Smith is my name.</font>

175
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What now?</i></font>

176
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are working to rid our land 
of inhumane culture.</font>

177
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've come to remonstrate with the foolish 
young lady who idolizes Scarlett Castiel.</font>

178
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to leave.</i></font>

179
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This bit about hallucinogens 
in particular.</font>

180
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me it's referring 
to Jackal's Paradise.</font>

181
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jackal's Paradise?</font>

182
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of Jackal's Paradise...</font>

183
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where do you think you're looking?</font>

184
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't want the likes 
of me in your sight?</font>

185
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How very aristocratic.</font>

186
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bigots don't even consider 
us common folk human.</font>

187
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I d-don't think that's fair to—</font>

188
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are my parents bigots too, then?</font>

189
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate!</font>

190
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you the Lorraines' daughter?</font>

191
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I come from a baronial family, 
but my mother was born a commoner.</font>

192
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we still bigots simply 
because we're of the nobility?</font>

193
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid you must excuse me for today.</font>

194
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate, thank y—</font>

195
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it true you got engaged 
to the Earl of Ulster?</font>

196
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

197
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it is true.</font>

198
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't tell me anything?</font>

199
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know I said I'd wait for you to open up,</font>

200
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that doesn't mean this doesn't hurt.</font>

201
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate...</font>

202
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do I do now?!</font>

203
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could I have been so awful to Kate?!</font>

204
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Still, I can't drag her into this. 
Not Kate, of all people.</i></font>

205
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Grail.</font>

206
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Lordship.</font>

207
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, thank you so much
 for the other day.</font>

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What for?</font>

209
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the investigative committee.</font>

210
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. She didn't mince words.</font>

211
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How like Abigail.</font>

212
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'll have to pay her 
a thank-you visit.</font>

213
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What could be the matter?</font>

214
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Kendall Levine, 
a high-ranking diplomat.</font>

215
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a special envoy from Faris.</font>

216
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What could have him so flustered?</font>

217
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds like they've lost 
a member of their delegation.</font>

218
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Scarlett there?</font>

219
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes. You see...</font>

220
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ulysses?</font>

221
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone by that name 
has been missing since yesterday.</font>

222
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know him?</font>

223
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's probably Ulysses Faris, 
the nine-year-old seventh prince of Faris.</font>

224
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A p-prince?!</font>

225
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A kidnapping, perhaps?</font>

226
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How horrible.</font>

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, why haven't
 the Farisians said anything?</font>

228
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me, Miss Grail. I must—</font>

229
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Return to the Security Force, right?</font>

230
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Ulysses is bound 
to be terribly anxious.</font>

231
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please find him as soon 
as you possibly can.</font>

232
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will. As for your meeting 
with Crown Princess Cecilia...</font>

233
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be careful.</font>

234
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her Royal Highness won't 
trip me up if I can help it.</font>

235
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If all else fails,
 I'll use Your Lordship's name.</font>

236
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may be no match for her 
even then, but nevertheless...</font>

237
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well said.</font>

238
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In any case...</font>

239
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm intrigued by who could possibly
abduct someone amid all this security.</font>

240
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your intuition again?</font>

241
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We still have time. 
I'll see what I can find.</font>

242
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome!</font>

243
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, where's Randy?</font>

244
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm terribly sorry. 
Urgent business called him away.</font>

245
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too bad for him!</font>

246
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, have a seat! Have a seat!</font>

247
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't had a guest 
in this room in ages!</font>

248
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you learn anything?</font>

249
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I discovered one suspicious man.</font>

250
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vado, a merchant 
from the Republic of Soldita.</font>

251
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He came to see Cecilia.</font>

252
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unusual, aren't they?
They came from all over the continent.</font>

253
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a merchant who finds them for me.</font>

254
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's ever so good at his job.</font>

255
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does this merchant... call on you often?</font>

256
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. His name's Vado, by the way.</font>

257
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was here just yesterday.</font>

258
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He came with a massive wicker hamper
on his back full of carpets to sell me.</font>

259
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why do you ask?</font>

260
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No reason.</font>

261
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm so sorry.</font>

262
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tea will get cold.</font>

263
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a distinctive smell.</i></font>

264
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yours is ordinary black tea.</font>

265
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to be rather sickly.</font>

266
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vado fetches me 
this special herbal tea as a favor.</font>

267
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, that's why we have separate pots?</font>

268
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. Why else?</font>

269
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm terribly sorry.</font>

270
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The attempted poisoning of 
Your Royal Highness is so famous,</font>

271
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assumed you must 
always be on your guard.</font>

272
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean Scarlett Castiel?</font>

273
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You speak as though 
you know all about it.</font>

274
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I've only heard rumors.</font>

275
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll tell you the story.</font>

276
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That day,</font>

277
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enrique reneged on
 an appointment with Scarlett</font>

278
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in order to pay me a get-well visit.</font>

279
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was furious.</font>

280
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That very night, we found that one 
of our water jars had been poisoned.</font>

281
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her earring lay beside the poisoned jar,</font>

282
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and a half-empty bottle of poison 
was discovered in her home.</font>

283
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rest happened just as you've heard.</font>

284
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was executed for her crime.</font>

285
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I am guilty of falling in love
 with Enrique when I knew he was engaged.</font>

286
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:52,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's my fault that he has 
no children. Poor Enrique.</font>

287
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he means to cede the throne 
to Johan, his younger brother,</font>

288
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who has a son and a daughter.</font>

289
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Royal Highness...</font>

290
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her woe-is-me act doesn't seem to have 
won her any favor around here.</font>

291
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take that herbal tea. It has poison
 meant to terminate pregnancy.</font>

292
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she's always drinking it, 
it'd wreak havoc on her insides.</font>

293
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her body must be as cold as ice.</font>

294
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

295
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, nothing! Just...</font>

296
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The thing is...</font>

297
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How stupid can you be?</font>

298
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave well enough alone. 
Now you've made yourself a target.</font>

299
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I couldn't just let 
an unsuspecting person drink poison.</font>

300
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Did you ever consider
 I might be making it up?</font>

301
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may be a liar, Scarlett,</font>

302
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I can still tell 
when you're speaking the truth.</font>

303
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've certainly gotten 
cheeky lately, girl.</font>

304
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, about that merchant... 
She said he was carrying a hamper.</font>

305
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

306
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could hide a small child in that.</font>

307
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd better do a bit more digging.</font>

308
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How?</font>

309
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}To learn of a professional,</font>

310
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}ask someone in the same trade.</font>

311
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all that,</font>

312
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we've learned Faris has a monopoly 
on that abortion drug,</font>

313
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but no one knows this man named Vado.</font>

314
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, my. No one knows a man 
important enough to visit the palace?</font>

315
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds like extremely valuable 
information, if you ask me.</font>

316
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really think so?</font>

317
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So sorry. Something seems 
to be wrong with the rear wheels.</font>

318
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll just be checking on them.</font>

319
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C-Certainly.</font>

320
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please pardon the delay.</font>

321
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I feared, one of the rear wheels 
is about to fall off.</font>

322
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

323
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

324
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He sounded... different.</font>

325
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The coachman's voice is different 
from when we got in.</font>

326
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something the matter?</font>

327
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why was the driver replaced?</font>

328
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could this man be...?</font>

329
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A <i>spell</i>?</font>

330
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. For spotting bad guys.</font>

331
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they react to it at all, 
you'll know they're very bad people.</font>

332
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kiriki kirikuku.</font>

333
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,470
