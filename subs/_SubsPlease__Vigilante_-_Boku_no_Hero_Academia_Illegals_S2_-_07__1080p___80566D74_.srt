<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I think he's trying very hard.</font>

6
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,990

for as hard as he tries,</font>

8

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With a Quirk like his... makes 
me wonder if that's part of it.</font>

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are such a pain, Aizawa!</font>

10

13
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,140

14
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just how my Quirk works.</font>

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, all this stuff about making

harder for villains, then?</font>

19
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,450

boils down to how Quirks interact...</font>

20

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot!</font>

135
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Shota...</font>

136
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you gonna do if you run 
up against that villain again?</font>

137
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know, I'm not sure.</font>

138
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His smoke can make your eyes irritated 
even from being in its proximity.</font>

139
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you stay too far back, it'll block 
your vision so much you can't see him.</font>

140
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a bad match for your Erasure, 
since it projects from your eyes.</font>

141
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And smokescreens make it hard 
for me to operate, too.</font>

142
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about I lend you my goggles?</font>

143
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That way, your eyes will be 
protected even if you get close.</font>

144
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll teach you the hard way...</font>

145
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you can use your Quirk.</font>

146
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Erasure!</font>

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not getting any more smoke?!</font>

148
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Son of a...</font>

149
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those eyes... you did this, didn't you?</font>

150
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno what kinda crap you pulled,</font>

151
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I don't need no smoke</font>

152
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to kick some kid's ass!</font>

153
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shirakumo!</font>

154
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On it!</font>

155
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cloud!</font>

156
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More of them?!</font>

157
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you boys had it in you.</font>

158
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice teamwork, Loud 
Cloud and Eraser Head!</font>

159
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you two work together, you might 
add up to a half-decent superhero.</font>

160
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

161
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work, boys!</font>

162
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they heroes?</font>

163
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're students at Purple's office.</font>

164
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're waiting for a smile, now!</font>

165
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right on!</font>

166
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still waiting! Loosen up a little!</font>

167
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,660
<font face="Verdana" size="20"><b>{\an1}<i><font color="#172922"><font size="35">The next term</font></font></i></b></font>

168
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yo, yo, yo!</font>

169
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up with the goggles, Aizawa?</font>

170
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and Oboro doing a pair look now?</font>

171
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure are!</font>

172
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're working as a duo, after all!</font>

173
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really. But since 
my Quirk needs my eyes,</font>

174
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we figured it'd be good 
to protect them...</font>

175
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say what?</font>

176
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You trying to rip me off?</font>

177
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's Sensoji from Class B!</font>

178
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great, just who I wanted to see.</font>

179
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rip you off how?</font>

180
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My Quirk, Blast, is pretty powerful,</font>

181
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but has some issues with accuracy.</font>

182
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But with these sunglasses, my own 
blast doesn't blind me anymore,</font>

183
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I get way more effective in combat!</font>

184
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Learned a thing or two 
about eye protection.</font>

185
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm on the same level as him...</font>

186
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the record, homeboy here 
copied my own sunglasses look!</font>

187
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happened while we were 
at our work study together.</font>

188
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you two were at the same agency?</font>

189
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys should be grateful.</font>

190
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might be trash, but I'm gracious
enough to use you as references.</font>

191
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I better not see 
you stealing my ideas!</font>

192
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's kinda self-centered, isn't it?</font>

193
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's just running his mouth. 
Ignore him. Let's go.</font>

194
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today's combat training 
will be two versus two team battles.</font>

195
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for the pairs... looks like 
we'll be making that call again.</font>

196
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir!</font>

197
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I've been doing my work study with 
Shota, can we practice together today?
</font>

198
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine. Try and operate like 
you would in actual combat.</font>

199
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If any of you are in a similar 
situation, go ahead and pair up.</font>

200
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, teacher!</font>

201
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up, Yamada?</font>

202
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I gotta say no thanks to the 
idea of teaming with Sensoji!</font>

203
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in the mood for something different.</font>

204
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too bad! Your mood's not a priority.</font>

205
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He might complain, but they really do 
come across as an impressive team.</font>

206
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sensoji's Blast and Yamada's Voice...</font>

207
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both Quirks are flashy and work 
well as suppressive weapons.</font>

208
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just spamming them could 
potentially take a villain down.</font>

209
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:41,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Compared to that, Aizawa and Shirakumo 
have a really technical style.</font>

210
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Downright tricky, even.</font>

211
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's have it out, Aizawa!</font>

212
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I win, you ditch the goggles!</font>

213
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They piss me off for some reason!</font>

214
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm supposed to care?</font>

215
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're on! Our goggles 
versus your sunglasses!</font>

216
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why have I been dragged into this?!</font>

217
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These goggles are like the 
symbol of our friendship, Shota.</font>

218
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's protect them!</font>

219
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're enjoying this, 
aren't you, Shirakumo?</font>

220
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stay out of it, Yamada.</font>

221
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can take these wimps on my own!</font>

222
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time to blow away the trash!</font>

223
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Catch!</font>

224
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a little cloud in your eyes!</font>

225
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice try!</font>

226
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time for a pop quiz!</font>

227
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are we hiding?</font>

228
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stupid gimmicks...</font>

229
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I blow away all your clouds, 
that'll take care of it!</font>

230
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The answer? Shota's behind you, and—</font>

231
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in front!</font>

232
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This ain't over!</font>

233
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough's enough.</font>

234
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, two on one isn't exactly fair.</font>

235
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bet's off, too.</font>

236
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't beat me.</font>

237
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I don't need those stupid sunglasses!</font>

238
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit, Sensoji, do you even understand 
the point of this exercise?!</font>

239
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a team battle!</font>

240
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shirakumo, Aizawa!</font>

241
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two are making good use of 
those hard-to-handle Quirks!</font>

242
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work! Keep it up!</font>

243
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it, Sensoji! I'm not done with you!</font>

244
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We got praised in passing!</font>

245
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, what am I supposed to do 
without my trademark sunglasses?</font>

246
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This, actually! Whatcha think? 
Do I look good or what?</font>

247
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you wearing goggles now, too?</font>

248
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, the three of us are gonna 
work as a trio some day!</font>

249
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamada's coming to the 
Purple agency too?</font>

250
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That seems sudden.</font>

251
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, man, we're talking long-term.</font>

252
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our boss...</font>

253
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He likes to raise rookies up 
so they can go indie, right?</font>

254
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He loves putting youngsters 
through their paces.</font>

255
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I do like to push hard.</font>

256
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what I figure is...</font>

257
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The three of us start our own 
agency and go independent.</font>

258
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's my plan.</font>

259
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think we've got good chemistry!</font>

260
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take Shota.</font>

261
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never take the initiative, but 
you're really detail oriented,</font>

262
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and are a perfectionist with 
the stuff you do take on.</font>

263
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Definitely can't say that 
about me and Hizashi!</font>

264
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess not. You two are 
basically slackers.</font>

265
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then there's your Erasure Quirk.
It can't cinch a battle on its own,</font>

266
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it can throw just about any enemy off 
their game, and set up our advantage!</font>

267
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which is where the two of 
us come in and nail 'em!</font>

268
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, sounds like a winning strat to me!</font>

269
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, having no initiative, and being 
unable to win fights on my own...</font>

270
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All that really means is I can't 
do anything without help, right?</font>

271
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It just means you're suited to teamwork!</font>

272
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll handle all the idea 
and initiative stuff!</font>

273
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then you do all the hard work!</font>

274
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it. That sounds like 
absolute hell for me.</font>

275
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I never agreed 
to work with you two.</font>

276
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't wanna?</font>

277
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, Aizawa's just playing hard to get!</font>

278
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that it? You're hard 
to understand, Shota.</font>

279
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two...</font>

280
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love the smell of youth in the air!</font>

281
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Kayama! What's up?</font>

282
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way you bicker so playfully... 
it's magnificent!</font>

283
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm totally serious over here.</font>

284
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna see some kitty pics?</font>

285
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn, you're easy, Aizawa!</font>

286
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't he adorable?</font>

287
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say something, Aizawa!</font>

288
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, we were discussing setting up 
an agency for the four of us...</font>

289
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The four of us?!</font>

290
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to break it to you,</font>

291
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but once I've gone independent, I'm 
going to run my agency like a castle,</font>

292
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with all sorts of boys 
seeing to my needs!</font>

293
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love it! Gotta appreciate someone 
who's honest about their desires!</font>

294
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I should go work for her...</font>

295
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about our plans, man?</font>

296
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all wearing those goggles now?</font>

297
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanna try them on?</font>

298
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

299
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you look good
no matter what you're wearing!</font>

300
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You guys do whatever you want.</font>

301
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about like this?</font>

302
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Absolutely fantastic!</font>

303
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

304
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The wind seems to be blowing the 
clouds along at quite a clip.</font>

305
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to think I'd never get anywhere,</font>

306
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but now I'm on the verge 
of being carried away.</font>

307
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The sky I saw from beneath 
those goggles...</i></font>

308
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>was bigger and wider than I anticipated.</i></font>

made it into Tasomiya!</i></font>

311
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Over 300 buildings have been demolished!</i></font>

312
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Current number of injured is unknown!</i></font>

313
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The expanding area of conflict has led

318
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,270

319
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there was no way I could take 
down a giant villain on my own.</font>

320
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But my heart was in a frenzy.</font>

321
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spurred on by his voice,
