1
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. There's nothing to worry about.</font>

2
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luida and Brad and the others 
will protect us. Okay?</font>

3
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

4
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

5
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you don't have to fight now?</font>

6
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

7
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I've already made up my mind.</font>

8
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm protecting this ship 
and everyone on it.</font>

9
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite being a softie 
who can't even kill his enemies?</font>

10
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Undertaker, are your eyes okay?</font>

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I can see, more or less.</font>

12
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More or less?</font>

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's all that?</font>

14
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flash-bangs I found in the warehouse. 
Better than nothing.</font>

15
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, we found a motorcycle, too!</font>

16
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to try riding it. Vroom, vroom!</font>

17
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here!</font>

18
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate to admit it, but I have no chance 
against the blue-haired freak.</font>

19
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That goes double for Mr. Softie here.</font>

20
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to your explanation, 
this "Legato Bluesummers" fellow</font>

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">can use telekinesis to control 
other people's bodies. Is that right?</font>

22
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you even beat someone like that?</font>

23
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will... do the best I can do.</font>

24
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if that results 
in you getting carted off?</font>

25
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So then they wake up Knives and...</font>

26
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

27
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it'd be best just
 to kill you here and now.</font>

28
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, what?!</font>

29
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Without this idiot running amok, 
Knives won't be able to come back.</font>

30
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noman's Land can safely await 
the arrival of the colony fleet.</font>

31
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

32
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make sure your funeral 
is dignified and solemn.</font>

33
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you say, Needle-noggin?</font>

34
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's "keeping it in the house."</font>

35
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

36
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, wait, no! It's "self-serving."</font>

37
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Undertaker killing someone 
to do their funeral is very self-serving!</font>

38
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ammo! Come on.</font>

39
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right!</font>

40
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just kidding.</font>

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course you were! Hornfreak said it all.</font>

42
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I see. Now you're Vash the Stampede's
 sworn ally, are you?"</font>

43
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Meryl?</font>

44
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right, Milly. The Undertaker 
wouldn't harm his own friend.</font>

45
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not! He spent more than 
two years looking for Vash because...</font>

46
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, because they're friends!</font>

47
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never said a word. 
Stop wrapping this up without me.</font>

48
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Wolfwood.</font>

49
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For what?! I didn't say anything!</font>

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're here.</font>

51
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nai...</font>

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Target in range.</font>

53
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire!</font>

54
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beginning assault.</font>

55
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That didn't do anything!</font>

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As expected, missiles are useless.</font>

57
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have to take out their SSG.</font>

58
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">SSG?</font>

59
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their storm shield generator.</font>

60
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope they've taken shelter.</font>

61
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">SSG down! We're losing shields!</font>

62
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incoming flying object identified!</font>

63
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Signal: July!</font>

64
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tower of JuLai?!</font>

65
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the Ark!</font>

66
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Intercept them!</font>

67
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It takes 30 minutes to recharge.
Our shields won't last long either.</font>

68
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then get us close already, Doctor.</font>

69
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I had in mind.</font>

70
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look! Here they come!</font>

71
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen up, everyone!
We're taking them down!</font>

72
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To protect Noman's Land!</font>

73
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right!</i></font>

74
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shields down.</font>

75
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, give me control!</font>

76
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't push it too far.</font>

77
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, time to play!</font>

78
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All units, spread out!</i></font>

79
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time to move.</font>

80
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You go on ahead.</font>

81
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash...</font>

82
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash the Stampede.</font>

83
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fool who voluntarily 
gave up being a god.</font>

84
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fact that we need the likes of you
to bring Lord Knives back is...</font>

85
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">offensive.</font>

86
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go. Don't waste my time.</font>

87
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't go with you. 
You get it, don't you?</font>

88
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

89
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what is Vash the Stampede,
 the man who can't kill, going to do?</font>

90
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going down!</font>

91
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry about that. 
I'm a naughty boy, aren't I?</font>

92
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Always up to no good. 
I guess that's how I ended up here.</font>

93
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you've had enough, 
you never get out of this hell.</font>

94
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it all. What a shitshow to put on.</font>

95
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm pulling the curtains on you, 
you lousy ham!</font>

96
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it.</font>

97
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess not being able to see 
is kind of a weakness after all.</font>

98
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it goes.</font>

99
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Aren't you going to shoot?</font>

100
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop.</font>

101
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop or I really will.</font>

102
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you truly want to stop me, aim here.</font>

103
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you couldn't do it.</font>

104
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Playtime is over.</font>

105
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will take you to our god.</font>

106
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two, for now.</font>

107
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doctor, can you hear me? 
Come get us already.</font>

108
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amazing! This is incredible!</font>

109
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are Lord Knives's 
little brother after all!</font>

110
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much can you resist? Can you move?</font>

111
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's try it out!</font>

112
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice! Very nice!</font>

113
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash...</font>

114
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meryl, is that...</font>

115
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like in JuLai.</font>

116
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not getting away.</font>

117
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you not to push it!</font>

118
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we take a direct hit,
not even this ship can...</font>

119
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up, pops.</font>

120
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Pops"?!</font>

121
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what they're targeting!</font>

122
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a chance!</font>

123
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's nothing!</font>

124
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

125
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That idiot!</font>

126
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice! I knew you could do it!</font>

127
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More! Show me more, Vash the Stampede!</font>

128
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow...</font>

129
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?</font>

130
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who said it was playtime?! Ugh!</font>

131
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks...</font>

132
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I almost crushed something
 precious to our lord.</font>

133
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't ever forget that you're a pawn.</font>

134
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Get in.</i></font>

135
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're leaving.</i></font>

136
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We still only have two!</font>

137
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's enough for now.</i></font>

138
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>With Vash, we have enough to awaken him.</i></font>

139
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Ark has also been hit.</i></font>

140
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There is no further need to fight. Get in.</i></font>

141
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Needle-noggin...</font>

142
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain! Main guns are online!</font>

143
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do we shoot?!</font>

144
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash...</font>

145
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's gone quiet.</font>

146
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it over?</font>

147
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicholas the Punisher.</font>

148
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Traitor to our god.</font>

149
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you here to get killed?</font>

150
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never betrayed anyone. I did my job.</font>

151
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The contract is done.</font>

152
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I'm Nicholas D. Wolfwood.</font>

153
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's right, Bluesummers.</font>

154
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is no time to start a fight.</font>

155
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why are you here at all?</font>

156
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

157
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno. I just kind of followed.</font>

158
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What an idiot.</font>

159
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what about you?</font>

160
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to work 
for Lord Knives again?</font>

161
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way. I already did my fair share.</font>

162
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want to watch.</font>

163
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will humanity survive, or perish?</font>

164
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will the paradise of plants 
come to be, or will it not?</font>

165
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An observer, then.</font>

166
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. Keep those eyes peeled.</font>

167
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much longer, Doctor?</font>

168
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's ready.</font>

169
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry! Wake Lord Knives up!</font>

170
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us begin.</font>

171
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gate connected: Vash the Stampede.</font>

172
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did it!</font>

173
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back, Lord Knives!</font>

174
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Knives, are you okay? 
Does anything hurt?</font>

175
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me be alone with Vash.</font>

176
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up with his hair color?</font>

177
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The same thing happened
 to Needle-noggin. I mean, to Vash.</font>

178
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The black represents fatigue.</font>

179
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Independents don't
 have infinite power.</font>

180
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

181
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need.</font>

182
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be running low. 
Don't push yourself too hard.</font>

183
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need.</font>

184
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me know when that changes.</font>

185
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happens when they get tired?</font>

186
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their bodies will shut down,
 the same as yours would.</font>

187
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As Knives and Vash 
continue to use their powers,</font>

188
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">at some point, their hair 
will be completely black, and—</font>

189
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll die?</font>

190
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Death is inevitable for all living things.</font>

191
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only difference is 
when and how it arrives.</font>

192
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you hear me, Vash?</font>

193
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Big Fall of 150 years ago... 
That was a failure.</font>

194
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This time, I will succeed.</font>

195
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will destroy the humans and 
create a paradise for our brethren.</font>

196
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A do-over of the genesis.</font>

197
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the distant past, humans 
on Earth forgot their god</font>

198
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and enjoyed a hedonistic life.</font>

199
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To cleanse them, god sent a massive flood.</font>

200
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A select few humans and animals 
boarded a ship to survive.</font>

201
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's the Ark.</font>

202
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knives will wipe out
 all humanity on this planet.</font>

203
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only ones to survive 
will be those aboard the Ark and...</font>

204
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The plants.</font>

205
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he's got no way to summon 
a huge flood on this planet.</font>

206
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's Knives trying to do?</font>

207
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will call rain down 
upon this dry planet...</font>

208
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A rain of a thousand immigrant ships.</font>

209
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A "Genesis Flood" Big Fall.</font>

210
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

211
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will stop you. 
As many times as it takes.</font>

212
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will stop you, Nai.</font>

213
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

214
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep your eyes on my brother. 
No rest, no sleep.</font>

215
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, on my life!</font>

216
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay there. Until the last moment.</font>

217
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay by my side, Vash.</font>

218
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The darkest hour is just before the dawn.</font>

219
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our dawn is nigh.</font>

220
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My brethren. Tesla.</font>

221
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will take in your power...</font>

222
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to fulfill our greatest aspiration!</font>

223
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?!</font>

224
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Comms are down?</font>

225
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world is being disconnected.</font>

226
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if there is no answer there.</font>
