1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow...</font>

2
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only he can make our wish come true.</font>

3
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the young prodigy can at 
least protect the hero, I'm sure.</font>

5
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I lost that one.</font>

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't beat you anymore, Oliver.</font>

7
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop slacking off!</font>

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you're a lot stronger than this!</font>

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You used to be so much 
better! What happened?</font>

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're overestimating me.</font>

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was all I've got.</font>

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I used to be stronger.</font>

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you grew up to be stronger than me.</font>

14
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all there is to it.</font>

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I refuse to believe that!</font>

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what to tell you.</font>

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way I can beat you. 
You're a genius.</font>

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just you wait.</font>

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make you take this seriously.</font>

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way.</font>

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to kill you.</font>

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good work, Orhun.</font>

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sion!</font>

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too bad about losing, huh?</font>

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't know you were here.</font>

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I looked lame in front of you.</font>

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you looked really cool.</font>

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And, you know...</font>

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know your real strength.</font>

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is all the strength 
I've got right now.</font>

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's...</font>

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the result of my heart 
being too weak to endure them.</font>

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My strength, and the way 
those grown-ups look at me...</font>

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now Oliver's carrying 
that heavy burden.</font>

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my fault.</font>

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'll have to help him...</font>

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't let you be alone!</font>

40
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be strong enough 
to stand by your side!</font>

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sion...</font>

42
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that we can beat the **** together!</font>

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a ****, just like you!</font>

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll always be with you!</font>

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you go someplace far away,
I'll catch up to you!</font>

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So don't try to bear all 
the burdens yourself.</font>

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Okay...</font>

48
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do everything I 
can to catch up to you.</font>

49
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when I do, someday ****</font>

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll become a **** and we'll *** 
walk side by side there together...</font>

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So for now, be my guide,</font>

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun.</font>

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES, PARTY OF NONE</font>

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES, PARTY OF NONE</font>

55
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry to come so 
suddenly, Grandmaster.</font>

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guild master for the continent's southern 
regions has come to me in a hurry.</font>

57
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assume it's a matter of import?</font>

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}EPISODE 8: THE JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES
FIGHTS WITH EVERYONE</font>

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Three days ago, an adventurer defeated</font>

60
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Black Dragon alone in a 
region under my jurisdiction.</font>

61
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Finally?</font>

62
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The conquest of the southern 
dungeon should resume, then.</font>

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he must be suicidal, 
challenging the Black Dragon alone.</font>

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm told that it was in 
reaction to an emergency:</font>

65
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Black Dragon appeared outside of its 
normal habitat, the Floor 92 boss area.</font>

66
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps the vanishing of
the "west" had an effect.</font>

67
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So was it Oliver who defeated it, then?</font>

68
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it wasn't.</font>

69
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

70
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But who else...</font>

71
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It couldn't have been Orhun Dura?</font>

72
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know of Orhun?</font>

73
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Impossible.</i></font>

74
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's going on?</i></font>

75
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If he had that kind of power,</i></font>

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>he wouldn't have chosen 
to defeat a Floor Boss.</i></font>

77
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has he been acting unusual lately?</font>

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not particularly.</font>

79
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So he hasn't returned 
to his original state.</i></font>

80
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's gained enough power to defeat 
the Black Dragon some other way.</i></font>

81
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything else happens with 
Orhun, tell me immediately.</font>

82
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

83
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's that.</font>

84
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a waste of time.</font>

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Five top-level parties working together?</font>

86
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't expect that.</font>

87
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It still ended the same as ever, though.</font>

88
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just glad none of us were hurt.</font>

89
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What now, Sion?</font>

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm...</font>

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There won't be any powerful adventurers</font>

92
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">showing up here at the Eastern 
Great Dungeon for a while.</font>

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should probably leave for a bit.</font>

94
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not come out already?</font>

95
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have good eyes, Mistress Sion.</font>

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's hear what you want, Messenger.</font>

97
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a message from HQ.</font>

98
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone has appeared at the 
Southern Great Dungeon</font>

99
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who's powerful enough to defeat 
the Black Dragon alone.</font>

100
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dragonslayer...</font>

101
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are to make contact with him, and,
if you decide he's an enemy, kill him.</font>

102
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone that powerful, in the south?</font>

103
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">HQ says it's likely he's 
already sided with the Church.</font>

104
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

105
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given the lack of information, 
it's likely not Oliver.</font>

106
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to bring him over to our side.</font>

107
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have to kill him
if he's with the Church, though.</font>

108
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

109
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the message.</font>

110
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be going, then.</font>

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That magic's handy. It lets 
him just appear and disappear.</font>

112
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you heard,</font>

113
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll be heading to the Southern 
Great Dungeon as soon as we're ready.</font>

114
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger that.</font>

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The south is Church territory, 
just like this place.</font>

116
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll need to be careful.</font>

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

118
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder how strong this dragonslayer is.</font>

119
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll know once we fight him.</font>

120
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe someone appeared in 
the south who might be the same as me.</i></font>

121
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't want to get 
involved with that place,</i></font>

122
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I'm the only one 
who can deal with this.</i></font>

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If he's the real deal, the south 
might fall as quickly as the west.</i></font>

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I have to stop that, no matter what...</i></font>

125
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I swore that I'd carry on 
his will after he died,</i></font>

126
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and make this happen!</i></font>

127
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Orhun...</i></font>

128
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The person I loved most.</i></font>

129
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My feelings haven't changed.</i></font>

130
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They never will.</i></font>

131
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So...</i></font>

132
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I won't forget what happened 
that day, either...</i></font>

133
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The day my heart froze over.</i></font>

134
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm sorry I can't fight with you...</i></font>

135
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll fight... even if I'm all alone.</i></font>

136
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I won't let anyone get in my way.</i></font>

137
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I'll kill all those old men in the 
Church who drove Orhun to his death.</i></font>

138
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No matter what it takes.</i></font>

139
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dragonslayer...</i></font>

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If you're teaming up
with the Church,</i></font>

141
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll have to kill you.</i></font>

142
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun's accomplishments are incredible.</font>

143
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He risked his life to protect our comrades</font>

144
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">during the teaching 
expedition the other day</font>

145
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">by fighting the Black Dragon all alone.</font>

146
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only is he strong,</font>

147
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he has much knowledge that our clan lacks.</font>

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in the Heroes Party,</font>

149
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he did all the management 
and operations himself.</font>

150
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wasn't expecting him 
to be this laudatory.</i></font>

151
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In light of this,</font>

152
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to make him a lieutenant 
in the Night Sky Silver Rabbits.</font>

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can take the place of Albert, who died 
fighting the Black Dragon last year.</font>

154
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since this requires the approval of 
two-thirds of the existing lieutenants,</font>

155
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to take a vote now.</font>

156
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those in favor...</font>

157
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir, a moment.</font>

158
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before the vote, I'd like to talk to him.</font>

159
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, we're glad to have you.</font>

160
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our leader has recommended you.</font>

161
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone expects great things of you.</font>

162
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But are you prepared to offer 
your life for the clan?</font>

163
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you become a lieutenant,</font>

164
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">your decisions will change the 
lives of many of our members.</font>

165
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To the clan's members, 
the clan is everything.</font>

166
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which is why we must do everything 
we can to protect the clan,</font>

167
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and put its needs above all else.</font>

168
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can understand that.</i></font>

169
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But...</i></font>

170
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't do that!</i></font>

171
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I swore a vow on that day 
that I can never break.</i></font>

172
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I won't betray it...</i></font>

173
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am...</font>

174
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">not prepared to offer 
my life for the clan.</font>

175
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

176
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That statement not only makes you unfit to
be a lieutenant, but even a clan member.</font>

177
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, you're not prepared to give 
everything to the Night Sky Silver Rabbits.</font>

178
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why is it you're here?</font>

179
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To protect those I care about.</font>

180
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've had that resolve since 
I decided to join the clan.</font>

181
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a member of the Night 
Sky Silver Rabbits,</font>

182
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do everything I can 
to protect my comrades!</font>

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun...</font>

184
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that no matter what horrible things 
happen, I won't lose anything...</font>

185
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll become strong enough to protect those 
I care about no matter what happens.</font>

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the vow I swore when 
I became an adventurer.</font>

187
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And who are these people you care for?</font>

188
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assume you mean not the clan 
itself, but its members, then?</font>

189
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'll protect them to the end, 
no matter what happens.</font>

190
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even at the cost of my life.</font>

191
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is my answer.</font>

192
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

193
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take the vote, then.</font>

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those in favor of making Orhun one 
of our lieutenants, raise your hand.</font>

195
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You scared me for a moment then!</font>

196
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. That's just who I am.</font>

197
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, whatever.</font>

198
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, you get to meet Unit 1.</font>

199
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everybody's looking forward to it.</font>

200
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just a moment, Selma-cchi!</font>

201
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma-cchi?</font>

202
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to talk to our new lieutenant.</font>

203
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, about that, right?</font>

204
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, this is Estella. She's with 
our adventure management division.</font>

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, we met at the meeting.</font>

206
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to bother you.</font>

207
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you good at teaching others, 
mister new lieutenant?</font>

208
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's someone you want 
me to teach, you mean?</font>

209
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I expected from the multi-talented 
man who was in the Heroes Party!</font>

210
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have to waste time explaining!</font>

211
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's actually a new party 
I'd like your help with.</font>

212
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Again?</font>

213
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know you're up for it.</font>

214
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to ask you to do it, too.</font>

215
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But won't that interfere with Unit 1?</font>

216
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not something to worry about.</font>

217
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll have more free time than 
you did at the Heroes Party.</font>

218
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't spend multiple days 
going into the dungeon.</font>

219
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ban going into the Great Dungeon 
for more than three days at a time.</font>

220
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's very generous.</font>

221
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine, then.</font>

222
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

223
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're really talented, 
so you can expect great things.</font>

224
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you mean...</font>

225
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll send the materials over today.</font>

226
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye-bye!</font>

227
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's finally here!</font>

228
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been waiting, Dragonslayer!</font>

229
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So this is the Night Sky Rabbits' 
strongest party, Unit 1?</i></font>

230
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get so nervous.</font>

231
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! We met once when we 
all fought that dragon!</font>

232
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or did Selma leave such a big impression 
you forgot about all of us?</font>

233
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not.</font>

234
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, we should introduce ourselves again.</font>

235
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As the oldest, I'll start.</font>

236
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Rain Hugwell!</font>

237
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm twenty-four years old and a mage.</font>

238
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come talk to big sister 
if you need anything!</font>

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big sister?</font>

240
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Are you saying they're small?</font>

241
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I think they're quite big.</font>

242
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your clothes.</font>

243
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay! Okay!</font>

244
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My turn now!</font>

245
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name's Lucretia Otis!</font>

246
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm an 18-year-old healer!</font>

247
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call me Lucre!</font>

248
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next is the happy-go-lucky Wil!</font>

249
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't introduce me like that!</font>

250
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Wilkes Savery, the Defender.</font>

251
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm 20 years old.</font>

252
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call me Wil.</font>

253
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And once again, I'm Selma Claudel.</font>

254
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The leader of this party 
and an Enchanter.</font>

255
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to have you.</font>

256
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to be here.</font>

257
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>These four are my new comrades...</i></font>

258
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your turn now, Orhun.</font>

259
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Orhun Dura.</font>

260
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm 18 years old and a front-line attacker.</font>

261
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do my best to catch up to all of you.</font>

262
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to be here.</font>

263
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lately, I've been in Albert's role.</font>

264
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'll be happy to give that job to you!</font>

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it. I'll do my best.</font>

266
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to be so formal, Orhun.</font>

267
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, but...</font>

268
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're the same age and I don't 
speak formally, so it's okay!</font>

269
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should respect your elders more.</font>

270
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What's that about?</font>

271
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's easier to communicate 
if you're relaxed.</font>

272
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}And don't call me happy-go-lucky!</font>

273
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's true, though!</font>

274
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, if that's why...</font>

275
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so...</font>

276
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could we start by asking you how 
you beat the Black Dragon?</font>

277
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

278
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to force 
yourself to answer.</font>

279
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I think you need to share 
information with your comrades.</font>

280
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A big reason I was able to defeat 
it was two original spells.</font>

281
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Original...?</font>

282
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first is called Impact.</font>

283
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can raise the effects of equipment 
or magic up to 100 times.</font>

284
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One hundred times?!</font>

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second is a spell that 
can be cast multiple times</font>

286
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to boost the effects of support 
magic more than you can usually do.</font>

287
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much?</font>

288
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thirty-two times,
during the Black Dragon fight.</font>

289
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thirty-two times?!</font>

290
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? That's no fair!</font>

291
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can only use it on myself,</font>

292
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the stress is so immense 
that I can't fight for long with it.</font>

293
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Black Dragon fight went 
on longer than expected,</font>

294
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it was really rough for me.</font>

295
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Impact alone is a huge advantage.</font>

296
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're that strong, you could do 
the other positions as well, right?</font>

297
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I can only use mid-ranked 
magic no matter how much I try.</font>

298
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? No way!</font>

299
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though you know enough about magic 
to make your own original spells?</font>

300
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I don't know why.</font>

301
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

302
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but...</font>

303
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't use higher-ranked magic, 
but I have my original spells.</font>

304
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think I'm that useless...</font>

305
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You worked really hard, huh?</font>

306
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you learn to use 
higher-ranked magic someday!</font>

307
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Rain!</font>

308
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope so too.</font>

309
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, do you have a special ability?</font>

310
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sure do.</font>

311
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means we've got three 
people in Unit 1 who do.</font>

312
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Who else?</font>

313
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's better that you see 
down in the dungeon.</font>

314
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm planning on having us learn to work 
together in the Great Dungeon tomorrow.</font>

315
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Agreed.</font>

316
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay! Let's have a welcome 
party for Orhun, then!</font>

317
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

318
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

319
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got somewhere to be?</font>

320
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I actually lost my weapon 
fighting the Black Dragon.</font>

321
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we're going into the dungeon, 
I need to buy a new one.</font>

322
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? You don't have a weapon?</font>

323
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll take days to get a new one!</font>

324
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry.</font>

325
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mine's off-the-shelf, so I 
can just go buy a new one.</font>

326
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Off-the-shelf?</font>

327
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not made-to-order?</font>

328
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been good enough so far,</font>

329
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I can use my support magic to 
make it strong and sharp enough...</font>

330
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe, sure,</font>

331
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you're a star member of the 
Night Sky Rabbits starting today!</font>

332
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't let people see you using 
a sword you bought from a store!</font>

333
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

334
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Dragonslayer's using 
an off-the-shelf sword?</font>

335
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right! So we want you 
to make us a new one, Aran!</font>

336
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... you're entrusting your 
life to your sword, right?</font>

337
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised you've survived this long.</font>

338
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been an Enchanter the past few years.</font>

339
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weapons just aren't that important to me.</font>

340
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

341
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When Rain got mad at me, I understood.</font>

342
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that I'm a part of the Night 
Sky Silver Rabbits' Unit 1,</font>

343
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've decided I need a weapon 
worthy of my position.</font>

344
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun...</font>

345
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aran, would you make me a sword?</font>

346
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. It'd be an honor.</font>

347
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a dedicated blacksmith 
for the Rabbits,</font>

348
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he's the best around!</font>

349
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can guarantee its quality.</font>

350
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't flatter me.</font>

351
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know...</font>

352
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's one problem.</font>

353
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Problem?</font>

354
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we want to make a sword for Orhun,</font>

355
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it should be made of materials from the 
deepest floors of the dungeon, right?</font>

356
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm out of those.</font>

357
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll need you to get them for me.</font>

358
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though we're getting a sword 
so he can go down into the dungeon?</font>

359
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talk about putting the 
cart before the horse...</font>

360
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's fine.</font>

361
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got a lot of stuff 
from the deepest levels.</font>

362
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, why do you have all this?</font>

363
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got it all when I was in the 
Heroes Party and never used them.</font>

364
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow! Wow!</font>

365
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Griffin claws! Manticore fangs!</font>

366
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this black one is...</font>

367
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this...?</font>

368
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A scale from the Black Dragon I defeated.</font>

369
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right...</i></font>

370
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They all fought the 
Black Dragon and lost...</i></font>

371
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and a party member died.</i></font>

372
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've reopened that old wound...</i></font>

373
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I made a mistake.</i></font>

374
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... I'm sorry.</font>

375
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

376
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can make the strongest sword 
ever with a Black Dragon scale!</font>

377
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It must really bother her, but she's 
not letting it show for my sake...</i></font>

378
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, I'll use the Black Dragon 
scale as the main ingredient,</font>

379
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so is there anything else you want?</font>

380
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm...</font>

381
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have that welcome 
party some other time.</font>

382
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Wil!</font>

383
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine.</font>

384
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't wait to see the 
Black Dragon sword!</font>

385
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take your time and tell 
him everything you want.</font>

386
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>
