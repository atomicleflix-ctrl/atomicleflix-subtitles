<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you laughing?</font>

5
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No reason.</font>

6
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, has Koushi Oborozuki 
put out a new book?</font>

7

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unfortunately, I've been

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I'd love to meet them.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need to rush. I won't run away.</font>

24

25
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I didn't do anything special.</font>

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I simply wrote what I perceived 
with my own eyes and ears.</font>

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, the key is experiencing 
things for oneself.</font>

28
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It allows one to write the truth,</font>

29
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">unlike stories that are 
the product of imagination.</font>

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That story is pure fantasy.</font>

32
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing like my own works.</font>

33
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you're not familiar with it?</font>

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been calling you.</font>

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Kokorowa, you seem rather tired.</font>

43
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Not at all. Anyway, 
you've returned to the capital?</font>

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed. I was on my way to your place.</font>

45
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I even brought you a gift. Look.</font>

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have my gratitude.</font>

47
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that, Sakuna?</font>

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to purchase Koushi's 
new book, but it's not out yet.</font>

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These were on display, 
so I bought a copy.</font>

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a journal called <i>Shiki Zoushi</i>.</font>

52
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only read the beginning, 
but it's interesting.</font>

53
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must experience it 
for myself after all...</font>

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

55
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna, I have a request.</font>

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why so formal?</font>

57
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I help you grow rice this spring?</font>

58
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? But you must be busy.</font>

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to experience everything, 
from planting to harvest.</font>

60
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you should.</font>

62
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

63
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've never performed farm work 
before. You can't do it alone.</font>

64
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just let us handle it.</font>

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, let's go to your place.</font>

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These pickles are exquisite.</font>

67
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, too?</font>

69
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't think I can do it either?</font>

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa? Why are you so upset?</font>

71
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not upset.</font>

72
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're definitely upset.</font>

73
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am not upset!</font>

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've made my decision.</font>

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will grow rice on Hinoe Island.</font>

76
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do everything from harvesting 
to planting—no, to tilling.</font>

77
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tilling? But you can't.</font>

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have work to do in the capital.</font>

79
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you go again, telling me I can't.</font>

80
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just growing rice! I can handle it!</font>

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Just"?</font>

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Growing rice is far more 
difficult than you imagine.</font>

83
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even I struggled at first.</font>

84
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't harvest any rice. 
I still struggle sometimes.</font>

85
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't underestimate it.</font>

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not.</font>

87
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want to prove I can do it, too.</font>

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you both calm down?</font>

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

90
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

91
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't say another word. 
Do as you please.</font>

92
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness.</font>

93
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I will.</font>

94
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will.</font>

95
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa?</font>

96
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa!</font>

97
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you...?</font>

98
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me for not 
notifying you in advance.</font>

99
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to fulfill my promise.</font>

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About growing rice?</font>

101
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

102
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall prove I can successfully 
grow rice by myself.</font>

103
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, could I borrow 
a field you're not using?</font>

104
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your situation seems rather 
complicated, Lady Kokorowa,</font>

105
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we'll do everything we can to help.</font>

106
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Tauemon.</font>

107
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you, Sakuna.</font>

108
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, sure.</font>

109
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can use one of 
the unused fields here.</font>

110
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Haven't you begun work on this one?</font>

111
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh...</font>

112
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd prefer a field that's 
had less work performed on it.</font>

113
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then perhaps an abandoned 
field would be better.</font>

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure that 
I've seen one around here.</font>

115
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

116
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Ashigumo.</font>

117
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There should be an 
abandoned field east of here.</font>

118
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's rather neglected, though.</font>

119
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

120
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Sakuna and Lady 
Kokorowa, take a look.</font>

121
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it, huh?</font>

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like it hasn't 
been used in a while.</font>

123
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's even a stream.</font>

124
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be able to irrigate it right away.</font>

125
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's cold.</font>

126
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not perfect, 
but the soil seems fertile.</font>

127
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It should make an adequate field.</font>

128
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Sakuna!</font>

129
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This shed has all 
the equipment she'll need.</font>

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With a little dusting, 
it should be usable.</font>

131
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm worried about weeds, though.</font>

132
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've taken root, so it 
won't be easy to prepare the field.</font>

133
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna, may I use this shed 
and abandoned field?</font>

134
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa, have you been listening?</font>

135
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I want to use this field.</font>

136
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be worth the effort.</font>

137
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But how are you going to 
remove all this wilted grass?</font>

138
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about that.</font>

139
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are these?</font>

140
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're only prototypes,</font>

141
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but when equipped with farming tools, 
they can till, plow, and irrigate.</font>

142
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've made something 
rather convenient again.</font>

143
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish we had one of our own.</font>

144
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have the scroll on agriculture 
and my automatons.</font>

145
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be fine.</font>

146
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Kokorowa, I leave 
this field in your hands.</font>

147
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

148
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall grow some fantastic rice.</font>

149
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Kokorowa?</font>

150
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I invited her,</font>

151
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but she said she'd have food brought 
from the capital on the regular ships.</font>

152
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I put in extra effort 
 to welcome Kokorowa.</font>

153
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is a shame.</font>

154
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

155
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She could at least eat with us.</font>

156
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

157
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I can successfully grow rice by myself, 
then surely Sakuna will admit...</i></font>

158
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's done.</font>

159
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time to plant the rice.</font>

160
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are those bags of seed rice? What?</font>

161
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're putting them in hot water? 
What are they doing?</font>

162
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks good.</font>

163
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've taken on more strain 
and muddy water than expected.</font>

164
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe how 
little progress I've made.</font>

165
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My body feels so heavy.</font>

166
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tauemon?</font>

167
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

168
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My seedlings...</font>

169
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Tauemon do this?</font>

170
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:43,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never be able to write 
a new book for Sakuna like this.</font>

171
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa.</font>

172
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna?</font>

173
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone...</font>

174
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. You were stressing the seedlings.</font>

175
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were looking spindly.</font>

176
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Sakuna told me to do it, 
but I should've told you as well.</font>

177
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite all right. You crushed 
my seedlings to help them.</font>

178
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to ask you something else.</font>

179
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you dunk your 
seed rice in hot water?</font>

180
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes the seedlings 
more resistant to plague.</font>

181
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea.</font>

182
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assumed I could 
easily grow rice as well,</font>

183
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it's not something a novice can do.</font>

184
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did well, Kokorowa.</font>

185
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? But I haven't 
accomplished a single thing.</font>

186
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, you've been working hard.</font>

187
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's commendable.</font>

188
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I...</font>

189
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa, I'm sorry 
for what I said at the capital.</font>

190
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For assuming you couldn't do it.</font>

191
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Please forgive me.</font>

192
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should be apologizing to you.</font>

193
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was arrogant of me to think 
I could grow rice on my own.</font>

194
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

195
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to learn more about 
growing rice on Hinoe Island.</font>

196
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please, Sakuna,</font>

197
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will you help me grow rice?</font>

198
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

199
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I, Sakuna the harvest goddess, 
will help you for the next year.</font>

200
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

201
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Kokorowa, here.</font>

202
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this for me?</font>

203
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seemed to be struggling in the 
kimono you brought from the capital,</font>

204
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I made it for you.</font>

205
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try it on.</font>

206
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Yui.</font>

207
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should eat with us from now on.</font>

208
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That will make the food taste better.</font>

209
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's right.</font>

210
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd be glad to help 
you grow rice as well.</font>

211
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will?</font>

212
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate it.</font>

213
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kokorowa!</font>

214
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

215
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're crying first?</font>

216
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I missed you!</font>

217
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't spoken in forever!</font>

218
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I missed you, too.</font>

219
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be together now!</font>

220
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna.</font>

221
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kokorowa, you came.</font>

222
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, since you offered.</font>

223
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall prepare dinner right away.</font>

224
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}PEST CONTROL</font>

225
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea my mother's scrolls 
were in that shed.</font>

226
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

227
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sakuna, may I read these scrolls?</font>

228
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine, but are they 
legible in this state?</font>

229
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall decipher Lady Toyohana's 
precious scrolls on agriculture.</font>

230
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Kokorowa.</font>

231
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The automatons in the capital 
are acting strangely?</font>

232
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'd like you to return 
as soon as possible.</font>

233
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I inspected them 
thoroughly before I left.</font>

234
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There shouldn't be 
anything wrong with them.</font>

235
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides...</font>

236
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about the rice.</font>

237
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise we'll look after it.</font>

238
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you can count on us.</font>

239
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

240
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I will leave my rice 
in your hands for a while.</font>

271
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

272
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then have you read 
<i>The Unrequited Love Story</i>?</font>

273
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The author, Koushi Oborozuki, 
must be a dreamer.</font>

274
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite different from my book.</font>

275
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They haven't published 
a new book recently.</font>

276
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps they've given up writing.</font>

277
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure...</font>

278
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure Koushi Oborozuki 
will publish a new book soon.</font>

279
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's overflowing with determination.</font>

280
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will be different 
from her previous works.</font>

281
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

282
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just what I've heard.</font>

283
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the Amahoho arrives 
from Hinoe Island,</font>

284
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">her new book will be published.</font>

285
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Now, if you'll excuse me...</font>

286
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I will publish a new book for Sakuna 
while growing rice by the end of the year.</i></font>

287
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must resume growing rice 
and begin writing right away!</font>
