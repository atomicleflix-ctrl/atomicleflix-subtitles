00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

140
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're all right.</font>

141
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My form is too much of a challenge
for your slave.</font>

142
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He needs more training.</font>

143
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And the way he lost control like that...</font>

144
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's dangerous!</font>

145
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That part doesn't worry me.</font>

146
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll be sure to keep him in line.</font>

147
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

148
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki Wakura!</font>

149
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ouch!</font>

150
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My whole body's sore.</font>

151
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, that's right.
I passed out afterwards.</font>

152
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I completely lost control of myself.</font>

153
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have to train harder!</font>

154
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why can't I... focus?!</font>

155
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why does lending Yuuki
to the others bother me so badly?</font>

156
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Kyouka!</font>

157
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah, you're awake.</font>

158
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm ready for some training!</font>

159
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki...</font>

160
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You must still be tired.</font>

161
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I slept it off! I'm fine!</font>

162
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The repercussions of the
Supreme Commander's form are too severe.</font>

163
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You've got spirit, but I told you
to stay in bed until you recover.</font>

164
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm sorry.</font>

165
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Things have been hectic lately...</font>

166
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I wanted to get back to training with you
as soon as possible.</font>

167
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just get some rest.</font>

168
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But...</font>

169
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It won't do any good if you're worn out.</font>

170
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's an order.</font>

171
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, ma'am.</font>

172
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It seems the joint practice sessions
are effective.</font>

173
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll hold more of them
when we have the opportunity.</font>

174
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's in a really, really bad mood!</font>

175
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Blend in.</font>

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fade into the background.
Don't attract her attention.</font>

177
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Speaking of which, Kyouka...</font>

178
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Where's Yuuki Wakura?</font>

179
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Didn't I instruct you
to bring him with you?</font>

180
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sounds like she's taken a liking to Yuuki.</font>

181
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's going to cause problems.</font>

182
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He's exhausted from training
with the 10th Squadron.</font>

183
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He can't do anything in his condition.</font>

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How sad for the little slave!</font>

185
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I see.</font>

186
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In that case...</font>

187
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">See me afterwards, Bell.</font>

188
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?</font>

189
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You figured out how to lend Yuuki
to other people, didn't you?</font>

190
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's like I said during the meeting:
Yuuki's exhausted!</font>

191
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I know, he's ready to drop.</font>

192
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Poor thing...</font>

193
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If anything happens,
the 6th Squadron will back you up.</font>

194
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So give him a break.</font>

195
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I was certain you were
going to ask to borrow him, too.</font>

196
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course I'm interested.</font>

197
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I did suggest it that one time.</font>

198
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But... there's no need to rush.</font>

199
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Things are different between us nowadays.</font>

200
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Commander Uzen.</font>

201
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'd like to discuss something with you.</font>

202
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I appreciate everyone
taking turns like this.</font>

203
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm feeling a lot better.</font>

204
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's 'cause we need you back
on chore duty soon.</font>

205
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You and I have some training to do, too.</font>

206
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah.</font>

207
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Which reminds me...</font>

208
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The last time, his reward was...</font>

209
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Makes me wonder how lewd
it's going to get the next time.</font>

210
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm back.</font>

211
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Commander! Welcome home-</font>

212
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So the time has finally come.</font>

213
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Move aside, Himari.</font>

214
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You aren't working his body properly.</font>

215
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?!</font>

216
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's no ability, but...</font>

217
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,290
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}The Illustrious Azuma Family</b></font>

218
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,290
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Massage Technique</b></font>

219
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I feel like a brand new person!</font>

220
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll keep going.</font>

221
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Relax for me.</font>

222
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So that's the correct hand motion.</font>

223
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This technique relieves the fatigue
from a busy schedule.</font>

224
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Himari.</font>

225
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's almost time for the Azuma Banquet.</font>

226
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Azuma Banquet...</font>

227
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A battle to decide
the next head of the family!</font>

228
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mother made the announcement
after seeing the 1st Squadron</font>

229
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">select their new commander.</font>

230
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ordinarily, as her daughter,
I would receive the position...</font>

231
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but not in our household.</font>

232
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's based on potential.</font>

233
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Azuma Banquet is in five days.</font>

234
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Take time off and
gather at the Azuma estate.</font>

235
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've already cleared it
with all the commanders.</font>

236
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait a minute!</font>

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I won't be there.</font>

238
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't even want to look at that place.</font>

239
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Count me out of it!</font>

240
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't care who
the next head of the family is!</font>

241
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Himari.</font>

242
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shall we take a bath together?</font>

243
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No way!</font>

244
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Nice and muscular.</font>

245
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You've grown in more ways than one.</font>

246
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And yet, you were severely injured.</font>

247
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Cracking under pressure
is a fatal mistake.</font>

248
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Letting others cover for your weaknesses
is only going to get more people hurt.</font>

249
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just like Yachiho.</font>

250
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't jump to conclusions!</font>

251
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If you intend to keep fighting,</font>

252
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">then before you can disgrace
the Azuma name...</font>

253
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I, as your mother,
will finish you off myself.</font>

254
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And I should participate in the banquet
if I don't want that to happen, right?</font>

255
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Prove my strength.</font>

256
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right, fine!</font>

257
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll blow the entire Azuma Family
out of the water!</font>

258
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I haven't talked to the members
of the 9th Squadron very much.</font>

259
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's no reason to outside of work.</font>

260
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Azuma Family...</font>

261
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A distinguished family closely connected
to the history of the Demon Defense Force.</font>

262
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Especially Miss Tovera,
the former Supreme Commander.</font>

263
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's barely even human...</font>

264
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You get along well
with the Azuma Family, don't you?</font>

265
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I look after
one of their precious daughters.</font>

266
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's why I manage
to stay so cordial and neighborly.</font>

267
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You sure are amazing, Miss Tenka!</font>

268
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You look like
you're feeling better, Yuuki.</font>

269
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I am.</font>

270
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But the Supreme Commander's form
really took it out of me...</font>

271
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then we should be picky
about letting people borrow you.</font>

272
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's absolutely right!</font>

273
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No more of this willy-nilly stuff!</font>

274
