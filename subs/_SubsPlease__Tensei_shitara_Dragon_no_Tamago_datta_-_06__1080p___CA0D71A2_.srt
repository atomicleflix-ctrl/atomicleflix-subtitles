even though you're with me?</font>

00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,170

26

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shouldn't we have waited
for our other members to come?</font>

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Actually, it's easier
if you're the only one with me.</font>

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can just flee if the going gets tough.</font>

I can escape, though.</font>

because I'm part dog or what?</font>

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I was joking.</font>

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Even though this is a C-rank request,</font>

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">the objective is not to kill monsters,
but to search the forest.</font>

36
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So I didn't think it'd be
particularly dangerous.</font>

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, yeah.
We're searching for a person, right?</font>

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,960

to be dead or something.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thanks, Myria.</font>

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please leave for a little while.</font>

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay. Please, excuse me.</font>

63
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't want her to hear
the details about this mission.</font>

64
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, this dead-yet-alive
person we're looking for is?</font>

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">His name's Doz.</font>

66
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He was in a group with that girl,
and they fought against a Rock Dragon.</font>

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll head out to investigate now.</font>

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That girl is staring at us.</font>

69
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Myria feels responsible for Doz's death.</font>

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I suspect she's been
going into the forest to look for him.</font>

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's extremely dangerous
for her to go into the forest alone.</font>

72
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's why I want you
to uncover the truth behind the rumor.</font>

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So basically, we need to search the forest
and find proof that Mr. Doz is dead?</font>

74
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Finding his corpse would be best,</font>

75
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but in the worst case, we can settle this
by just searching for several days</font>

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and reporting that we found
no suspicious persons.</font>

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right.</font>

81
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,920

91
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I got Human Transformation the moment
I thought I'd be okay without it.</font>

92

with the black lizard,</font>

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but living in a proper village
would be nice...</font>

95
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I switch every three days, maybe I
can live in both the cave and the village?</font>

96
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, in any case,</font>

97
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,290

gain the trust of humans is awesome.</font>

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't think this village
has any religions like that.</font>

138
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can tell these figures
have been imbued with a powerful magic.</font>

139
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This scent...</font>

140
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's meat, no doubt about it.</font>

141
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's take a look inside the cave.</font>

142
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's bright.</font>

143
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Those are Light Shrooms on the walls.</font>

144
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Furs?</font>

145
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Something in this pot smells good...</font>

146
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's tons of red fruits in it.</font>

147
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I think these are spices.</font>

148
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Red fruits used as spices?</font>

149
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Could they be Red Gold?!</font>

150
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You mean Piperis?</font>

151
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maybe.</font>

152
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've never really
seen them before, either.</font>

153
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm gonna take some of this home with me!</font>

154
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You can't do that!</font>

155
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This cave is likely a hideout for thieves.</font>

156
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We could get caught up
in some shady business.</font>

157
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?</font>

158
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Stay far away from that!</font>

159
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What is that?</font>

160
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A monster nicknamed the Venom Princess.</font>

161
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">One bite from it can kill.</font>

162
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Luckily, it seems to have fled.</font>

163
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In any case,
we should get out of this cave ASAP.</font>

164
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shh! Everything's fine!</font>

165
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I saw the two of them go in the cave.</font>

166
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A human female knight,
and one with ears and a tail...</font>

167
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">could she be a dog-type demi-human?</font>

168
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They've gotta be impressed to see my pad!</font>

169
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, if I showed up right now...</font>

170
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,500
<font size="53" color="#ff0000"><b>{\an7}Monster</b></font>

171
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">they'd just assume I was a monster
wandering into the cave.</font>

172
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fine then!</font>

173
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have no choice!</font>

174
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm using Human Transformation again!</font>

175
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This world has demi-humans, after all.</font>

176
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's a chance they could
think of me as a puppy-human!</font>

177
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's not impossible!</font>

178
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, how are ya?</font>

179
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't be afraid, Yuno!</font>

180
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">O-okay!</font>

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Lucent Luna!</font>

182
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's a Plague Dragon!</font>

183
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My MP is already out! Let's run!</font>

184
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">R-right!</font>

185
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait! I'm...</font>

186
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm just...</font>

187
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,460

188
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,920
<font size="40"><b>{\an7}I Became Human and Got My Butt Kicked</b></font>

189
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's not following us, right?</font>

190
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah.</font>

191
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Seems we're safe.</font>

192
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't believe there are
Plague Dragons living in this forest.</font>

193
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What a nasty surprise.</font>

194
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They did tell us about
Rock Dragons, though.</font>

195
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What do we do?
Should we go back to the village?</font>

196
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, we hardly have anything to report
if we go back now.</font>

197
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Besides, we're going to need more manpower
if we want to investigate further.</font>

198
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then are we gonna call the usual crew?</font>

199
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes.</font>

200
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's leave the forest
and get in touch with them.</font>

201
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That was some good rest.</font>

202
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Looks like I'm fully recovered.</font>

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yesterday was the worst, even though
I finally got Human Transformation.</font>

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dang, I still feel down about it.</font>

205
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, I know!</font>

206
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Say, I need to ask you for something.</font>

207
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There are some stupid monkeys that're
always stealing the jerky I make,</font>

208
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">so I want to poison the meat
to teach them a lesson.</font>

209
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'd like the poison
to be as strong as possible,</font>

210
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">without any color or smell
that gives it away.</font>

211
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well? Can you make it for me?</font>

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is this poison?</font>

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's hardly any color or smell.</font>

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're so awesome!</font>

215
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just you wait, you stupid monkeys!</font>

216
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They're here.</font>

217
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, it's working!</font>

218
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Stupid vermin,
stealing other people's jerky!</font>

219
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm gonna knock you all out!</font>

220
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">None of you are a match for me!</font>

221
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So they're going for a team attack, huh?</font>

222
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Bring it.
We have better teamwork, anyways!</font>

223
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's how we do it!</font>

224
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,380

225
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's it mean?</font>

226
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It was a skill that called for back up?!</font>

227
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,130

228
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They knew they couldn't win
and called in a higher ranking monster!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have confidence
that none of us will walk away alive.</font>

274
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Weed out the weak and let them die away.</font>

275
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That is the way of our clan.</font>

276
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just as I killed my forefather
and ascended the throne.</font>

277
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is there seriously no room
for negotiation?!</font>

278
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There must be something I can do.
We can't go on like this.</font>

279
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, then...</font>

280
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's fight!</font>

281
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm challenging you to a duel!</font>

282
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In our world,</font>

283
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">duels only occur in disputes between clans
or when an alpha is supplanted.</font>

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is unprecedented, but it may work.</font>

285
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The rules could still apply even when
fighting another species.</font>

286
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But only if you and the lizard
are your own clan.</font>

287
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We are.</font>

288
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Very well. I accept your challenge.</font>

289
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The duel is a sacred ritual.</font>

290
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">None may interfere
until there is a winner.</font>

291
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right, then.</font>

292
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What are you doing?!</font>

293
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't get the wrong idea.</font>

294
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is just to ensure the black lizard
respects the rules of our duel.</font>

295
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She will be released if you beat me.</font>

296
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I found a way to make this one-on-one.</font>

297
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But he's got buffs and stuff.</font>

298
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How do I fight that?</font>

299
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What is wrong, small dragon?</font>

300
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Running around does not make a fight.</font>

301
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your actions are an insult to us
and disrespectful to our ritual.</font>

302
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't know what will happen
to the black lizard if I keep running.</font>

303
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've gotta do something!</font>

304
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Take this!</font>

305
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Rolling Tail Attack!</font>

306
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How'd you like that?!</font>

307
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,130
<font size="46" color="#ffff80"><b>{\an7}Confusion (Minimal)</b></font>

308
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That took off more
than I thought it would!</font>

309
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Crud! I've seen this before!</font>

310
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,380
<font size="53" color="#80ffff"><b>{\an7}Quick (Major)</b></font>

311

312
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He's fast!</font>

313
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't possibly
get away from him like this.</font>

314
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What do I do?</font>

315
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, then. I have no other option!</font>

316
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A head-on fist fight!</font>

317
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is a duel between two chiefs!</font>

318
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come at me, head on!
Or are you scared?!</font>

319
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You dare call me scared?!</font>

320
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He took the bait!</font>

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Get wrecked!</font>

322
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,670

327
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He countered me back?!</font>
