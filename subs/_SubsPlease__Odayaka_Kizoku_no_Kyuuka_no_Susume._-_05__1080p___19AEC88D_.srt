<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#474239">Episode 5</font></font></font>

2
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#474239">"Equals"</font></font></font>

3
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won't be up for two more hours.</font>

4
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The breakfast here is good, too.</font>

5
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

6
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like a flier?</font>

7
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An auction?</font>

8
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, at the event hall nearby.</font>

9
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds interesting.</font>

10
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're welcome to simply watch.</font>

11
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you have time, please stop by.</font>

12
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Gil.</font>

13
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They have books.</font>

14
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've read most books, haven't you?</font>

15
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They could be valuable books.</font>

16
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they're labyrinth 
goods, they're unique.</font>

17
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So books can be labyrinth goods.</font>

18
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any, Gil?</font>

19
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already sold it.</font>

20
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A Collection of Rare 
Plays by Adventurers</i>.</font>

21
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rare plays?</font>

22
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, do you want to go?</font>

23
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was actually thinking of 
visiting bookstores today.</font>

24
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you'd be poring over books either way.</font>

25
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It starts at three, huh?</font>

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I rush through the bookstores, 
I should be able to make it.</font>

27
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll probably get stuck somewhere.</font>

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do my best not to.</font>

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil, let's go to the auction together.</font>

30
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll meet you there when it starts.</font>

31
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very good.</font>

32
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to buy that, mister?</font>

33
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I read a study by this author before.</font>

34
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember it because it 
was so difficult to read.</font>

35
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can say that again.</font>

36
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else?</font>

37
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, do you have any recommendations?</font>

38
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Sure.</font>

39
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got two of this author's books.</font>

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you like them?</font>

41
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, yes. The studies on magic items.</font>

42
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like the diagrams.</font>

43
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

44
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

45
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Read this.</font>

46
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This looks similar to the other ones.</font>

47
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting, right?</font>

48
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It directly challenges 
those books you like.</font>

49
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

50
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, no reading until you buy it.</font>

51
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

52
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a good book.</font>

53
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's both fascinating to 
compare or read on its own.</font>

54
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need a bit of knowledge to read it,</font>

55
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm sure you'll be fine.</font>

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll take this as well, please.</font>

57
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, but can you carry all that?</font>

58
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have spatial magic.</font>

59
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah? You sound like an adventurer.</font>

60
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I am an adventurer.</font>

61
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a funny joke.</font>

62
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll throw this one in for free.</font>

63
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I hate to ask, but are there 
any bookstores you recommend?</font>

64
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you even ask that?</font>

65
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I can see that 
you really like books.</font>

66
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take the next left.</font>

67
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, where is Gil?</font>

68
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any plans after this?</font>

69
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not surprised.</font>

70
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an7}<font size="30"><font color="#d42e5e">Hurry Up</font></font></font>

71
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My companion's here.</font>

72
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to keep you waiting.</font>

73
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's a shame.</font>

74
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't look like we can join you.</font>

75
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we see each other tonight, 
let's spend some time together.</font>

76
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were watching for 
a while, weren't you?</font>

77
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You noticed?</font>

78
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

79
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a good thing they 
were so considerate.</font>

80
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I'm on the clock 
escorting a noble?</font>

81
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I interrupt something?</font>

82
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot. Let's go inside.</font>

83
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for coming.</font>

84
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this number 37 paddle.</font>

85
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

86
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enjoy.</font>

87
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ladies and gentlemen, 
thank you for waiting.</font>

88
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The 23rd Great Marcade 
Auction will now begin.</font>

89
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's our first item.</font>

90
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A low-level healing potion from the 
labyrinth, starting at two silver coins.</font>

91
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Four silver coins.</font>

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have four silver coins from 44.</font>

93
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Five silvers, ten coppers.</font>

94
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I have five silvers and 
ten coppers from seven.</font>

95
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How does being from a labyrinth 
make it different?</font>

96
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't hurt when you use it.</font>

97
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. The standard ones 
are incredibly painful.</font>

98
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough to make a grown man roll 
around in pain from just a scratch.</font>

99
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nine silvers, nine silvers.</font>

100
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there are no other bids, 44 has 
won the bid with nine silvers.</font>

101
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, we have a painting collected by 
everyone from nobles to common folk.</font>

102
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let the bidding start at one gold coin.</font>

103
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have one gold coin from four.</font>

104
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you laughing?</font>

105
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Ein and his friends.</font>

106
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

107
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're going the wrong way.</font>

108
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did they not decipher the code?</font>

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They really did check everything.</font>

110
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's probably faster for them that way.</font>

111
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">63 wins the bid.</font>

112
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're doing their best.</font>

113
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, we have a unique item.</font>

114
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A genuine strategy guide from 
a labyrinth treasure chest.</font>

115
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A strategy guide?</font>

116
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A guide to defeating the labyrinth 
where the book was found.</font>

117
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's exactly what it sounds like.</font>

118
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has maps of every floor, 
describes the monsters on each,</font>

119
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the ecology and 
harvestable materials.</font>

120
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's incredible.</font>

121
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let the bidding start at one gold coin.</font>

122
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have one gold from sixteen.</font>

123
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One gold coin, one gold coin.</font>

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two gold coins.</font>

125
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have two gold from 48.</font>

126
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the people who want it 
don't seem like adventurers.</font>

127
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get it, don't you? 
They're collectors.</font>

128
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, adventurers don't need them.</font>

129
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They only appear on deeper floors.</font>

130
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting beaten up reaching 
the deepest floors</font>

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and finding that in a treasure 
chest just before the finish line</font>

132
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is way too late.</font>

133
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They describe the monsters that appear,</font>

134
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but just reading a book 
won't make you beat them.</font>

135
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So only the maps are useful.</font>

136
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they sell maps at 
the guild, don't they?</font>

137
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what are the books good for?</font>

138
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They can be sold for a lot.</font>

139
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have six gold from 51.</font>

140
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eight gold.</font>

141
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have eight gold from sixteen.</font>

142
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ten gold, then.</font>

143
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have ten gold from 37.</font>

144
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you buy that?</font>

145
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you curious to 
read a strategy guide?</font>

146
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ten gold coins, ten gold coins.</font>

147
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Twelve.</font>

148
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have twelve gold from sixteen.</font>

149
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fifteen.</font>

150
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have fifteen gold from 37.</font>

151
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sixteen.</font>

152
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Twenty.</font>

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Twenty gold coins, twenty gold coins.</font>

154
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there are no other bids, 37 
has won the bid with twenty gold.</font>

155
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil, do you want anything?</font>

156
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A powerful opponent I'd struggle to beat.</font>

157
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure we can buy 
that at an auction.</font>

158
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all I have to report.</font>

159
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I supposed to learn from that 
report except that he likes books?</font>

160
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I don't know.</font>

161
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely you don't believe he's 
actually here to sightsee.</font>

162
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your lordship, should I continue 
watching him tomorrow?</font>

163
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. Return to your normal duties.</font>

164
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

165
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They stick out.</font>

166
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything happens, I'll 
hear about it right away.</font>

167
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicely done.</font>

168
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they're going to pick fights, 
they should get stronger first.</font>

169
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He must've wanted to test his skill 
against the strongest adventurer.</font>

170
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pain in my neck.</font>

171
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil, who do you actually 
struggle against?</font>

172
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Recently, no one.</font>

173
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, about this...</font>

174
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

175
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Crystal Ruins are 
near here, aren't they?</font>

176
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. There are sightseeing 
carriages that run there.</font>

177
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sightseeing?</font>

178
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It's an attractive structure.</font>

179
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guild makes money selling sightseeing 
tours of just the first floor.</font>

180
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guests are probably delighted 
when monsters show up.</font>

181
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because they get to watch 
adventurers fight up close?</font>

182
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plus the possible reward on top of that.</font>

183
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The merchant nation's guild has 
a nose for profit, don't they?</font>

184
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You love double-checking everything, huh?</font>

185
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you curious?</font>

186
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd expect a strategy 
guide to be accurate.</font>

187
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guild's map is 
accurate, too, isn't it?</font>

188
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yeah. That labyrinth's been 
explored by hundreds of people.</font>

189
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This room isn't on the guild's map.</font>

190
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

191
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This room right here.</font>

192
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It overlaps with this room 
near the bottom floor.</font>

193
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you suppose it's a pit trap?</font>

194
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or there's a teleportation circle there.</font>

195
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do hidden rooms often contain goodies?</font>

196
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most have valuable labyrinth goods...</font>

197
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or powerful enemies.</font>

198
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to see this hidden room.</font>

199
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I go with you?</font>

200
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. Why not?</font>

201
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's a powerful enemy,
I fear I might get in your way.</font>

202
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never thought that.</font>

203
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, we've already 
found a hidden room.</font>

204
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not confident I can find it myself.</font>

205
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the first time you've 
depended on me for anything.</font>

206
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot.</font>

207
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a nice sightseeing spot.</font>

208
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's well-lit and pretty.</font>

209
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's hard to relax when 
you're fighting, though.</font>

210
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet this would sell for a lot.</font>

211
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Labyrinths can't be damaged.</font>

212
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, I've never 
seen one damaged before.</font>

213
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What floor is the hidden passageway on?</font>

214
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The 19th.</font>

215
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'll go to the 
20th and walk back up.</font>

216
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

217
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really wish they'd stop doing this.</font>

218
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're surprised, act like it.</font>

219
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which way?</font>

220
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way.</font>

221
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is easy with you here.</font>

222
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a compliment?</font>

223
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judging by the distance, 
it should be around here.</font>

224
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hidden passageway...</font>

225
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not here.</font>

226
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not even a gap.</font>

227
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most have some kind of 
trick to them, don't they?</font>

228
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, like pressing or moving something.</font>

229
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't see anything.</font>

230
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should we do?</font>

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's try doing something 
an adventurer wouldn't do.</font>

232
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil, it's probably here.</font>

233
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stand back.</font>

234
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you detect any traps?</font>

235
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. Let's go.</font>

236
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

237
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we open the treasure chest?</font>

238
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just a forest.</font>

239
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't tell what this is a map of.</font>

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps Judge would know.</font>

241
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe. Either way, it's probably valuable.</font>

242
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold onto that.</font>

243
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose it wouldn't let us leave 
after raiding its treasure chest.</font>

244
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No labyrinth is that agreeable.</font>

245
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then down there...</font>

246
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...is a powerful enemy.</font>

247
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dragon, huh?</font>

248
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

249
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what dragons are?</font>

250
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I doubt we stand a chance against—</font>

251
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has a breath weapon.</font>

252
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil, what—</font>

253
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just endure it.</font>

254
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

255
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your equipment will keep you from 
burning. It'll just be hot.</font>

256
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely something will burn.</font>

257
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I try something?</font>

258
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

259
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to make a hole in the middle.</font>

260
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do that?</font>

261
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a moment, if I spend a lot of mana.</font>

262
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give the signal.</font>

263
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now.</font>

264
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was hot.</font>

265
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That definitely burned my hair.</font>

266
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not burnt.</font>

267
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can see it now.</font>

268
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should we do?</font>

269
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should rest.</font>

270
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

271
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're low on mana, aren't you?</font>

272
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil.</font>

273
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you think I wouldn't notice?</font>

274
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay there.</font>

275
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will. Have fun.</font>

276
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil.</font>

277
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

278
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't like anyone seeing me 
tremble from lack of mana.</font>

279
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

280
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As far as I can remember,
I've never let anyone see it.</font>

281
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never raised my voice in pain,</font>

282
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and recently, I haven't even 
voiced a genuine complaint.</font>

283
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it'd be easier not to suppress 
it, but that's become normal for me.</font>

284
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shame on me. When I'm alone 
with you, I act spoiled.</font>

285
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not used to interacting 
with an equal.</font>

286
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good night.</font>

287
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't you depend on me 
in a less confusing way?</font>

288
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I am a secretary.</i></font>

289
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I serve Lord Lizel directly.</i></font>

290
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty!</font>

291
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an emergency! Let me through!</font>

292
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lizel has vanished!</font>

293
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From where?</font>

294
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His office.</font>

295
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

296
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was teleportation magic,</i></font>

297
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>usable only by royals.</i></font>

298
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened?</font>

299
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lizel was sitting there speaking 
with me when he suddenly vanished.</font>

300
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He vanished?</font>

301
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was organizing documents here, and 
he vanished in the blink of an eye.</font>

302
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't notice anything else unusual.</font>

303
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liz!</font>

304
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about his earrings?</font>

305
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm certain he was wearing both.</font>

306
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet I can't detect him?</font>

307
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>His Majesty poured all the mana
he could into those earrings he made</i></font>

308
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>for Lord Lizel.</i></font>

309
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If he can't detect those, 
then could it be...?</i></font>

310
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty, may I come in?</font>

311
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

312
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard Chancellor Lizel disappeared.</font>

313
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, he suddenly vanished.</font>

314
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't even detect his earrings.</font>

315
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well?</font>

316
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Consider these the 
ramblings of an old man.</font>

317
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have time for ramblings.</font>

318
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I shan't tell you.</font>

319
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's related to Liz 
somehow, isn't it? Speak.</font>

320
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say the world has a reverse side.</font>

321
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A second world mirroring ours.</font>

322
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never heard about that from Liz.</font>

323
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard it from someone else.</font>

324
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Supposedly, the great-great-great 
grandfather of the friend of the person</font>

325
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who told me came from that other world.</font>

326
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like a load of bull.</font>

327
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if it's a possibility, 
I'll look into it.</font>

328
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If his earrings are merely broken 
but he's still in this world,</font>

329
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liz will return on his own.</font>

330
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if he really has gone 
to another world...</font>

331
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll bring him back.</font>

332
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty, where are you going?</font>

333
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to search every 
place I can reach.</font>

334
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be back for a while.</font>

335
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

336
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty, where are you going?!</font>

337
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Wait!</font>

338
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please wait!</font>
