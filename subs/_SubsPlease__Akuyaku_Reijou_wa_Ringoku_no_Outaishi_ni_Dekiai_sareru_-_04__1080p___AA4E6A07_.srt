00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made it a bit on the sweet side.</font>

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Philine.</font>

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that light?</font>

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There hasn't been a report 
from the castle yet.</i></font>

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What will Prince Aqua do when 
he finds out it was the Holy Prayer?</i></font>

6
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Assuming things follow the game's story...</i></font>

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Prince Aqua is a route 
introduced in the sequel,</i></font>

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so that shouldn't matter.</i></font>

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But now that the game's practically over,</i></font>

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>what if we're moving 
on to the sequel now?</i></font>

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

12
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm told that the light we saw earlier</font>

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was the result of defective 
magical equipment.</font>

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Lady Tiararose 
is asked to return home</font>

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">until the castle's inspection 
of said equipment is complete.</font>

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Understood.</font>

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it was defective magical equipment.</font>

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad it was nothing serious.</font>

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara, I'll see you home.</font>

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, thank you.</font>

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd really rather not go home.</i></font>

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to see for myself

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,160

29
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

30
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was surprised to learn that Lady Akari,</font>

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the girl by Prince Hartknights's side 
at the graduation party,</font>

32
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has learned to use the Holy Prayer.</font>

33
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be... Lady Akari did?!</font>

34
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This has become rather problematic.</font>

35
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Akari, of all people...</font>

36
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Holy Prayer is 
a power desired by all nations.</font>

37
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The benefits it brings are so great</font>

38
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that any nation possessing it 
can enjoy total peace.</font>

39
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, which is why those who 
can use it often marry royalty.</font>

40
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every royal family wants 
to make it their own.</font>

41
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

42
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's likely that Lapis Lazuli will make 
that girl marry Prince Hartknights</font>

43
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so that they won't ever lose her.</font>

44
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably so.</font>

45
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we can at least use the power 
of Marinforest to intervene.</font>

46
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we can obtain the Holy Prayer, 
our nation will prosper even more.</font>

47
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girl who can use the Holy Prayer, eh?</font>

48
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want her.</font>

49
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's been ten days since then,</i></font>

50
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I still know nothing 
about the Holy Prayer.</i></font>

51
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since my father is the prime minister, 
I'm sure he knows...</i></font>

52
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I can't ask him about something 
the royal family is keeping quiet.</i></font>

53
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"I actually know about the Holy Prayer!"</i></font>

54
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't tell him that, though.</i></font>

55
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I haven't seen Prince Aqua 
since that day either.</i></font>

56
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Does he not know about 
the Holy Prayer yet?</i></font>

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Or... if he does know about it...</i></font>

58
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Tiararose.</font>

59
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Preparations to depart 
for Marinforest are complete.</font>

60
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can go there whenever you're ready.</font>

61
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, I will 
accompany you all the way.</font>

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Philine.</font>

63
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when will you be departing?</font>

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it nearly time for Prince Aquasteed 
to return home as well?</font>

65
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is.</font>

66
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's so frustrating that I can't do 
anything but await word from him.</i></font>

67
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why isn't Prince Aqua here yet?</font>

68
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought once he saw 
the Holy Prayer's power,</font>

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he'd immediately say he wants me 
and head here to get me.</font>

70
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then I go to Marinforest 
with Prince Aqua,</font>

71
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then we get married!</font>

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or that's what I expected, 
but it's been two weeks!</font>

73
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Darn it, Prince Aqua! 
Just get here already!</font>

74
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Philine, what do you think?</font>

75
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks absolutely delicious!</font>

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good!</font>

77
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Prince Aqua is coming to see me.</i></font>

78
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The details must have 
finally been decided... right?</i></font>

79
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It'll be fine.</i></font>

80
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Father didn't say anything,</i></font>

81
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so I'm sure he won't bring bad news.</i></font>

82
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope Prince Aqua will like these.</font>

83
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I haven't been able to 
come here very much of late.</font>

84
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The preparations 
have been taking up all my time.</font>

85
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, don't worry about that.</font>

86
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder what's wrong with Prince Aqua...</i></font>

87
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The truth is, the engagement 
has been settled.</font>

88
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Akari's, that is.</font>

89
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

90
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lady Akari and... whom?</i></font>

91
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It wouldn't surprise me 
if he's been working</i></font>

92
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to get his hands on the Holy Prayer.</i></font>

93
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So then... it's going to happen again?</i></font>

94
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No! Please, don't take 
Prince Aqua from me!</i></font>

95
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i><font color="#ffffff">Anything but that!</font></i></font>

96
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Akari and Prince Hartknights 
are now formally engaged.</font>

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the man who hurt you.</font>

98
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I imagine you feel conflicted 
about this, but...</font>

99
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's not... with Prince Aqua...</i></font>

100
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara?</font>

101
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. I was just so relieved.</font>

102
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you were getting 
engaged to Lady Akari.</font>

103
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so scared.</font>

104
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you think that?</font>

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would never choose anyone but you.</font>

106
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I made you feel so uneasy.</font>

107
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come now, don't cry.</font>

108
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not...</font>

109
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

110
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua...</font>

111
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara, I missed you so.</font>

112
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As did I.</font>

113
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thank goodness.</i></font>

114
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,490

115
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,470

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll stay by my side

117
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, Prince Aqua.</font>

118

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the ending didn't go right at all!</font>

130
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... I'm not sure I understand.</font>

131
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need to play dumb!</font>

132
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here I was planning to marry 
Prince Hartknights and be happy...</font>

133
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but then along came my 
favorite, Prince Aqua!</font>

134
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't believe it!</font>

135
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Prince Aqua is 
the main route in the sequel,</font>

136
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I thought I'd be content with 
Prince Hartknights, my second favorite...</font>

137
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if I can marry Prince Aqua, 
I'd obviously rather have him!</font>

138
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't even know anything 
about the sequel, do you?</font>

139
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About the adorable 
heroine in Marinforest?</font>

140
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

141
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it!</font>

142
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was trying to trick you into 
admitting it. I'm so glad it worked!</font>

143
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I reincarnated.</font>

144
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember playing 
the game, but that's all.</font>

145
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm... So that means...</font>

146
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you died before even playing the sequel?!</font>

147
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's unbelievable!</font>

148
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You poor thing! There's no otome game 
out there anywhere near as amazing!</font>

149
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Hartknights is great,</font>

150
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but Prince Aqua in the sequel 
is so, <i>so</i> much better!</font>

151
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sequel's heroine is a duke's 
daughter in Marinforest named Icilla,</font>

152
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and just when Prince Aqua 
is feeling fed up with</font>

153
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the fiancée the state chose for him, 
he meets her on the seashore!</font>

154
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The sequel's heroine?</i></font>

155
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The event CG for that scene is just <i>gorgeous</i>!</font>

156
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I lost track of how 
many times I played it!</font>

157
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, I think you know this, 
but I can use the Holy Prayer.</font>

158
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if I tell my beloved Prince Aqua 
that, I'll be able to marry him.</font>

159
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please break up with him.</font>

160
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

161
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?</font>

162
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love him so much <i>more</i> than you do,</font>

163
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I played the game so many times!</font>

164
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua is not a game! He's a person!</font>

165
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that, of course!</font>

166
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the way you're looking at this 
ignores his wishes!</font>

167
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?</font>

168
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As the crown prince of a major 
country, once he finds out,</font>

169
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he'll obviously want me.</font>

170
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So just...</font>

171
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you...</font>

172
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was thinking, what about a scenario</font>

173
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where Lady Tiara gets injured 
and her engagement is called off?</font>

174
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. It'll only make you 
fall asleep a little.</font>

175
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can relax.</font>

176
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know you'll never get away with this!</font>

177
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm the heroine,</font>

178
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so when it's all well and truly over, 
I'm getting the happy ending!</font>

179
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come forth, thunder!</font>

180
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness. 
Looks like I made it in time.</font>

181
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua...</font>

182
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why...</font>

183
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is Prince Aqua here?</font>

184
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. I see I wasn't in time after all.</font>

185
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is going on here?!</font>

186
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Akari, you will 
explain this, won't you?</font>

187
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not what you think, Prince Aqua!</font>

188
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've learned how to use the Holy Prayer!</font>

189
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it looks like I'll be forced 
to marry Prince Hartknights...</font>

190
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please save me, Prince Aqua!</font>

191
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take me with you to your kingdom!</font>

192
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What gives you the right?</font>

193
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You love Prince Hartknights, do you not?</font>

194
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay out of this, Marquis Clamentile!</font>

195
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua, won't having me 
and my Holy Prayer</font>

196
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">make your kingdom even more prosperous?</font>

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Please don't...</font>

198
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not Prince Aqua! Please!</i></font>

199
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that.</font>

200
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you are in possession 
of the Holy Prayer.</font>

201
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why didn't you make me your fiancée?</font>

202
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't underestimate me.</font>

203
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can lead my kingdom to prosperity 
even without your power.</font>

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I don't need you.</font>

205
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only one I want...</font>

206
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is Tiara.</font>

207
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua...</font>

208
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lies...</font>

209
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All lies!</font>

210
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way you wouldn't choose me...</font>

211
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apprehend her.</font>

212
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you're all right. 
Do you have any other injuries?</font>

213
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'm safe because 
you came to my rescue.</font>

214
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this thing on my cheek 
is just a scratch.</font>

215
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

216
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just stay like that.</font>

217
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After what you've been through,</font>

218
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you're welcome to be 
a little more demanding.</font>

219
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua, thank you so much 
for coming to save me.</font>

220
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do I...</font>

221
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">have to live in a place like this?!</font>

222
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was spared from more serious punishment 
thanks to Lady Tiara, but still...</font>

223
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come, water!</font>

224
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as I'm in here, this is 
about the strongest magic I can use.</font>

225
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this were an otome game, 
a prince would come to save me...</font>

226
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, this <i>is</i> an otome game!</font>

227
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

228
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Hartknights!</font>

229
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You came for me!</font>

230
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll prepare tea right away!</font>

231
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be staying that long.</font>

232
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to.</font>

233
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I <i>want</i> to do it.</font>

234
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so boring here, I can't stand it.</font>

235
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and I will be married.</font>

236
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, understood.</font>

237
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You accepted that rather easily.</font>

238
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard that you... 
had feelings for Prince Aquasteed.</font>

239
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Of course, Prince Aqua is my favorite,</i></font>

240
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but Prince Hartknights is mistaken.</i></font>

241
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you, too, Prince Hartknights.</font>

242
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Call me impudent,</i></font>

243
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I love everything 
about this otome game world!</i></font>

244
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you a lot!</font>

245
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

246
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go home now.</font>

247
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring that luggage over here.</font>

248
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aquasteed, please 
take care of our daughter.</font>

249
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will, of course, 
and I will make her happy.</font>

250
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm already so happy, after all.</font>

251
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua, I'm already 
very happy, as well.</font>

252
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you got me.</font>

253
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Preparations to depart are complete.</font>

254
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going already? We'll miss you.</font>

255
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After I complete 
a year of bridal training,</font>

256
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll return here briefly 
for my debutante party.</font>

257
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can look forward to 
lots of gifts from Marinforest.</font>

258
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't wait.</font>

259
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be well, Tiara.</font>

260
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't do anything too reckless.</font>

261
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't.
