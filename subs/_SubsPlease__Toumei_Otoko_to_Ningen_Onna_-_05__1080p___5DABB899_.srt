1
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every ten seconds, she gets all giggly.</font>

2
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably doesn't realize she's doing it.</font>

3
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave her be.</font>

4
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Oh no.</i></font>

5
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}I'm not concentrating at all!</i></font>

6
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}I keep spacing out.</i></font>

7
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}We got back from camping yesterday,</i></font>

8
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}and it's finally sinking in...</i></font>

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}That Akira-san and I...</i></font>

10
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}kissed.</i></font>

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}That was my... first kiss, right?</i></font>

12
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, she's giggling again.</font>

13
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I mean, I've never had 
any romantic experiences!</i></font>

14
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has she been like this all day?</font>

15
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Broken record since this morning.</font>

16
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san. I'm sorry for the wait.</font>

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No problem!</font>

18
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we head home now?</font>

19
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes...</font>

20
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

21
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you think of 
stopping by a bar after dinner?</font>

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter?</font>

23
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... I was just thinking... it's nice 
that you're so unaffected by it all...</font>

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, the fact you're 
so calm and collected!</font>

25
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I almost feel like 
I should take offense at that.</font>

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sorry!</font>

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san. Your hand, please.</font>

28
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember what I told you at the start?</font>

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want you thinking you're 
the only one who's nervous.</font>

30
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well...</font>

31
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was completely beside myself 
on the bench that day.</font>

32
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you realized that.</font>

33
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's pressed against 
my back... He's so warm!</i></font>

34
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or do you dislike men 
who aren't always the picture of dignity?</font>

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I lo—</font>

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I prefer them.</font>

37
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you just change your wording?</font>

38
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One Scarlett O'Hara.</font>

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you are.</font>

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The glass seems very small.</font>

42
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a cocktail glass.</font>

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you go to bars?</font>

44
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid not.</font>

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's pretty rare for me 
to drink outside my home.</font>

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do most people come to bars to drink?</font>

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, they're a place you go to enjoy 
the pure pleasure of drinking.</font>

48
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or when you want to spend 
more time with someone.</font>

49
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Everything he says makes 
my heart skip a beat!</i></font>

50
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}I need to toughen up!</i></font>

51
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I recommend the fruity cocktails here.</font>

52
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it okay for you to drink so fast?</font>

53
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san?</font>

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're over here, right, Akira-san?</font>

55
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes...</font>

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna sit by your side.</font>

57
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right.</font>

58
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

59
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to tell you...</font>

60
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no romantic experience!</font>

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you're disgusted 
by my unrelenting childishness!</font>

62
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really not.</font>

63
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm older, anyway, so don't—</font>

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not interrupt!</font>

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

66
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kiss, too...</font>

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It was my first.</font>

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me, okay?</font>

69
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I sound like a child there too?!</font>

70
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not at all!</font>

71
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable!</font>

72
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're really not.</font>

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Why does she always want 
forgiveness for things?</i></font>

74
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Though, I've seen hints 
of that since our first date...</i></font>

75
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just have some water for now.</font>

76
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me. Water, please.</font>

77
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coming up.</font>

78
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Akira-san's so quiet.</i></font>

79
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Why did I say all that nonsense?!</i></font>

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san. We're here.</font>

81
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right!</font>

82
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Driver, could you wait here for a minute?</font>

83
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... Would you like to come in for tea?</font>

84
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not today, please.</font>

85
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}He's disgusted with me!</i></font>

86
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... Thank you 
for getting me home safe.</font>

87
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san.</font>

88
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

89
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can tell you have complicated feelings 
about what we talked about today.</font>

90
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But please...</font>

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">give me permission to treasure you.</font>

92
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san...</font>

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I feel more than 
adequately treasured by you!</font>

94
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You even gave me that raise earlier!</font>

95
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, thank you for that.</font>

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can go home with a light heart, then.</font>

97
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean by that?!</font>

98
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san! Akira-san!</font>

99
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's raining so hard!</font>

100
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sh-Shizuka-san!</font>

101
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Akira-san.</font>

102
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's raining so hard out there. 
I'm just miserable!</font>

103
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even my handkerchief is soaked!</font>

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That sounds awful.</font>

105
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I put a heater on the table by the sofa,</font>

106
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so make yourself at home.</font>

107
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's a towel for you, too.</font>

108
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, thank you!</font>

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem very well prepared...</font>

110
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you get rained on, too?</font>

111
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.</font>

112
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

113
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even my undershirt is soaked!</font>

114
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'll find you a blanket!</font>

115
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really appreciate that!</font>

116
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. It took some time to find one.</font>

117
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

118
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank yo—</font>

119
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your hands are wet. And they're cold.</font>

120
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your clothing's soaked, too! 
You're not fine at all!</font>

121
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You took advantage 
of my blindness, darn you!</font>

122
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sorry.</font>

123
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's still raining, huh?</font>

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

125
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,720

126
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

132
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting to do this with you...</font>

133
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes me... very happy.</font>

134
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san.</font>

135

136
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,090

137
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,020

138
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes, we did!</font>

139
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me adjust the temperature here...</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Remember how awkward 
our first meeting was?</i></font>

142
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,390

146
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,030

147
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for barging in on you that day.</font>

148
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, the fault is all mine.</font>

149
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, for you.</font>

150
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Manju? How lovely!</font>

153

164
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, weren't you listening?</font>

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And don't you encourage her, Akira-san!</font>

170
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My mother is very incorrigible!</font>

171
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to be good friends.</font>

172
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want to hire him for, anyway?</font>

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Check your father for infidelity, maybe?</font>

174
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just kidding!</font>

175
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not funny in the slightest!</font>

176
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry my mother is so brazen.</font>

177
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all.</font>

178
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was nervous about meeting 
her for the first time,</font>

179
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but she really kept things flowing.</font>

180
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a good mom.</font>

181
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you feel that way.</font>

182
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We also discussed something important.</font>

183
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something important?</font>

184
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How is Shizuka doing at work?</font>

185
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is she getting along with her coworkers?</font>

186
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

187
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's extremely capable.</font>

188
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're all reliant on her, 
myself included.</font>

189
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

190
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's really out there in the world now.</font>

191
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,030

194
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah. It's nothing.</font>

198
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me give you a hint.</font>

199
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It smells like a flower...</font>

200
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A rose, perhaps?</font>

201
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

202
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san, for you.</font>

203
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this...?</font>

204
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A present.</font>

205
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,640

209
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It smells amazing!</font>

210
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like being showered in rose petals!</font>

211
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

212
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san, don't you want to

213
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I want to keep it with me.</font>

216
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know.</font>

217
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a cafe in 
the rose garden, Shizuka-san.</font>

218
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say they use rose 
petals in all their sweets.</font>

219
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So many sweet smells!</font>

220
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At 12 o'clock, there's a scone.</font>

221
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At 3, there's a sandwich.</font>

222
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At 6, a tart.</font>

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At 9, a piece of cake.</font>

224
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

225
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sweets here are so adorable.</font>

226
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does it mean 
for sweets to be "adorable"?</font>

227
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're small, topped 
with fruit or cream...</font>

228
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in a variety of colors, I suppose?</font>

229
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So good!</font>

232
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Oh, thank you.</font>

233
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back!</font>

234
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that voice...</font>

235
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karma-san?</font>

236
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-chan. Excellent right hook!</font>

237
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. You startled me.</font>

238
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I tell you to wait here quietly?</font>

239
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what do you want from me today?</font>

240
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with the cold shoulder, man?!</font>

241
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Light-san?</font>

242
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh... She had other plans, apparently.</font>

243
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She usually tells me when she's 
got plans, but this time...</font>

244
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

245
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll just be gone for a while.</font>

246
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So my day's pretty free, 
and I came by to hang!</font>

247
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought you some tea!</font>

248
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today's a work day for us, you know.</font>

249
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, don't do me like that!</font>

250
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might look like a cool loner, 
but I actually need people around!</font>

251
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't see how this is my problem.</font>

252
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tonome-chan, are you nice 
to everyone but me?</font>

253
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speak of the devil, it's my honey!</font>

254
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hi! It's your sweet little dark elf bae!</font>

255
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why?!</font>

256
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, tell me!</font>

257
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Wait!</font>

258
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karma-san?</font>

259
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Light... went back to her parents.</font>

260
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does this mean...</font>

261
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}DIVORCE</font>

262
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,920

263
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure it's not! Probably.</font>

264
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make it sound 
like it's on the table!</font>

265
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not go home and call her back?</font>

266
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just trying to get rid of me!</font>

267
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Screw that! I'm staying put!</font>

268
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

269
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I have to be alone, 
I'll self-destruct from worry!</font>

270
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you a grown man?</font>

271
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san...</font>

272
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't we humor him

tonight, Tonome-chan!</font>

275
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry! I'll help out!</font>

276
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait. You're staying... with me?</font>

279
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning!</font>

280
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like a meal?</font>

281
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like a bath?</font>

282
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or would you like...?</font>

284
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,990

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karma-san. Have you called Light-san yet?</font>

287
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, still too scared to ask!</font>

288
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,290

298
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I attended to every single

300
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stop talking.</font>

301
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And stop phrasing things so suggestively.</font>

302
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, Tonome-chan, you're no fun!</font>

303
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san?</font>

304
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing. I'm feeling 
a lot better now that I'm with you.</font>

305
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, so...</font>

306
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a thanks for letting me 
crash with you...</font>

307
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help you with your 
detective work today.</font>

308
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he's the target?</font>

309
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that's right.</font>

310
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm supposed to follow him, 
but if he flies, I'll probably lose him.</font>

311
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds hopeless.</font>

312
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

313
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes it a rather difficult job.</font>

314
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need your h—</font>

315
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So you just gotta make sure 
he can't fly, right?</font>

316
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karma-san?</font>

317
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going home.</font>

318
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up?</font>

319
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wings feel heavy. They won't move.</font>

320
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karma-san. What did you just do?</font>

321
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I put a curse on him.</font>

322
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dark elves can use curses 
to dampen the abilities of others.</font>

323
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I've gotta be 
in a dark headspace for it to work.</font>

324
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one seemed very effective.</font>

325
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... I might get divorced, so yeah.</font>

326
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}He's more pressed than I thought.</i></font>

327
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karma-san. You can stay 
with me again today.</font>

328
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?!</font>

329
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In exchange, please call your wife.</font>

330
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?</font>

331
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on.</font>

332
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know, Tonome-chan, 
I can't see your face...</font>

333
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're kind of intimidating.</font>

334
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall I dial the number for you?</font>

335
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! I can do it!</font>

336
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine!</font>

337
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Then do it yourself!{bg}</font>

349
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it. Bye.</font>

350
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did she say?</font>

351
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Tonome-chan!</font>

352
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I gotta go home!</font>

353
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what they talked about.</font>

354

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know,</font>

358

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... I think we're just
