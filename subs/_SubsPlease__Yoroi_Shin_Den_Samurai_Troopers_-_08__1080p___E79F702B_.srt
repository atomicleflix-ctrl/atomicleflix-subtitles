00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, blow out the candles!</font>

4
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday!</font>

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this about?</font>

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ramaga told you, remember?</font>

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Gai, you turn fifteen today."</font>

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ignored it then, 
but it's a shame to waste a birthday.</font>

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. For you.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now <i>this</i> gets me all fired up!</font>

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got you a retro game from the 80s.</font>

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got you my favorite face massager!</font>

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean the one you've been using?</font>

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! Give your face a nice, 
good rub every day. Rub, rub, rub!</font>

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll pass.</font>

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What gives?!</font>

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It even cleans your pores!</font>

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, nobody wants a massager 
some dude's been using.</font>

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. From me and Kaito.</font>

22
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Rock Hara Junior College"?</font>

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Kaito loves this!</font>

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure? He bit my head off 
when I tried to watch it.</font>

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, really?</font>

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just rummaged through his room 
and thought it looked good.</font>

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't mind, right?</font>

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah.</font>

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?</font>

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, is it me, or has Kaito been 
acting weird since yesterday?</font>

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That bombshell Mr. Ujihara 
dropped hit him hard.</font>

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was all predetermined.</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's your destiny.</i></font>

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ujihara...</font>

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This guy went through 
the same training I did.</font>

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?!</font>

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Samurai Troopers need righteous spirits

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll record more when I'm myself again!</i></font>

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that was a bombshell all right.</font>

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knew that Shion and Kaito 
were orphans, too?</font>

47
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must now perform the ritual to
invoke the Armor of the Supreme Emperor!</font>

48
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, Armor of the Supreme Emperor!</font>

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rise again!</font>

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the holdup?</font>

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weird...</font>

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O Armor of the Supreme Emperor, awaken!</font>

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to us! Get over here! Pretty please?</font>

54
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, little Supremy-wemy, 
what's the matter?</font>

55
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is going nowhere.</font>

56
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, why don't you ask 
that Sagume girl from before?</font>

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't call her "that Sagume girl"!</font>

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I bet asking her would save time.</font>

59
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You think so?</font>

60
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, fine.</font>

61
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O Divine World! Reveal to me the path!</font>

62
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have the Three Sacred Treasures,</font>

63
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">yet the Armor of the

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you please deign to tell us why?</font>

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Three Sacred Treasures 
you possess are not yet complete.</font>

66
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean by "not yet complete"?</font>

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Sword of Domination remains 
little more than a Demon Sword.</font>

68
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To restore its rightful luster,</font>

69
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you require the aid of White Blaze.</font>

70
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White Blaze...</font>

71
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go to its dwelling place.</font>

72
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There, the way will open to you.</font>

73
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's White Blaze?</font>

74
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A sacred beast that saved Japan alongside 
the Samurai Troopers 35 years ago.</font>

75
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was especially close with Jun.</font>

76
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great. Where is he now?</font>

77
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's gone.</font>

78
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White Blaze...</font>

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is dead.</font>

80
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I met White Blaze during 
the Demon Outbreak 35 years ago.</font>

81
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We overcame many trials together 
and strengthened our bond.</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}EPISODE VIII
AGAIN</font>

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even after the battle ended 
and peace was restored,</font>

84
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White Blaze and I were inseparable.</font>

85
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At home,</font>

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">at school,</font>

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even at job interviews.</font>

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you nuts?!</font>

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hence I could never land a job.</font>

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll bet not.</font>

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, on Nasti's advice,</font>

92
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I went on a spiritual training journey.</font>

93
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And again, White Blaze came with me.</font>

94
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I endured grueling ascetic practices</font>

95
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and gained a calling as a conduit 
between the Divine World and ours.</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}SENGOKU UNIVERSITY</font>

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But five years ago, while researching the 
Sacred Treasures at Sengoku University,</font>

98
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard a revelation 
from the Divine World, and...</font>

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

100
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you push him off for?!</font>

101
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That heartwarming story took 
a sharp turn into psychological horror.</font>

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only did what the revelation told me to.</font>

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What exactly did it say?</font>

104
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No comment.</font>

105
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever. 
You did it to save your own skin.</font>

106
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't like that!</font>

107
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now. So, that's how White Blaze died?</font>

108
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

109
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He came back in a second.</font>

110
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, so he's alive?</font>

111
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

112
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I ended up selling him 
to the head of a zoo for 30,000 yen.</font>

113
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you say he was dead, then?!</font>

114
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sold White Blaze!</font>

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I cut ties with him! He's dead to me!</font>

116
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gimme a break!</font>

117
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we need White Blaze to make 
the Sword of Domination count, right?</font>

118
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we've gotta go anyway.</font>

119
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, when you put it like that...</font>

120
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Inmei, Gomei, Shimei, Gaimei.</font>

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I trust you know what must be done.</font>

122
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, allow me.</font>

123
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, now Anayama has fallen...</font>

124
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite interference 
from the Divine World,</font>

125
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the plan is proceeding smoothly.</font>

126
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emperor Ramaga, I beg your leave 
to ask a question.</font>

127
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sasuke!</font>

128
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You commanded us to stand by</font>

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in order to obtain the Armor 
of the Supreme Emperor.</font>

130
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So tell me...</font>

131
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How was Anayama's death
 part of your plan?!</font>

132
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because after the fact, I—</font>

133
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You be quiet!</font>

134
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Armor of the Supreme Emperor
 will lead all the world to its doom.</font>

135
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, Gai lacks the capacity 
to wield it as he is now.</font>

136
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I shall use the Ten Warriors 
to discipline him</font>

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and create a Puppet worthy of me.</font>

138
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You would command us 
to sacrifice ourselves?</font>

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not all of you.</font>

140
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean the Last Name Group?</font>

141
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the Last Name Group 
were to defeat the prince...</font>

142
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would abandon Gai.</font>

143
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no need of such a feeble Puppet.</font>

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rock Hara Junior College rules.</font>

145
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, they get me all fired up!</font>

146
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who said you could watch that?!</font>

147
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's mine now, so what's the problem?</font>

148
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already told you that was a mix-up!</font>

149
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your deal? 
I was just getting into it.</font>

150
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lend me something else, then.</font>

151
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is all I've got.</font>

152
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rock Hara Junior College is a mystery 
idol group who could pop up anywhere.</font>

153
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't announce their shows, 
and they never archive anything.</font>

154
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a miracle a Commoner 
managed to record this one.</font>

155
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A "Commoner"?</font>

156
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's what we call serious 
Rock Hara Junior College fans.</font>

157
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then from today on, we're Commoners, too.</font>

158
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you dare use that name lightly.</font>

159
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. Why now of all times?</font>

160
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still not over being an orphan?</font>

161
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't it bother you?</font>

162
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew my parents and I 
weren't related by blood.</font>

163
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this point, I'm like, "So what?"</font>

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's pretty rock 'n' roll.</font>

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those were my grandmother's last words.</font>

166
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Live a rock 'n' roll life."</font>

167
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always trusted her, 
but she had me totally fooled.</font>

168
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And?</font>

169
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My dad's out to kill me. 
Compared to that, it's no big deal.</font>

170
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you know?</font>

171
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say it's time we got 
looking for White Blaze.</font>

172
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong?</font>

173
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what gives?</font>

174
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, wake up.</font>

175
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Jun?</font>

176
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He and the boys went to the zoo 
where White Blaze is.</font>

177
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

178
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope they find him.</font>

179
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White Blaze is <i>here</i>?</font>

180
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talk about grisly.</font>

181
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the animals have either
escaped or been killed.</font>

182
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet White Blaze is gone, too.</font>

183
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll be here. I promised 
I'd come back for him.</font>

184
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm amazed you're that confident 
after selling him for 30,000 yen.</font>

185
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since the Puppets all woke up at once...</font>

186
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of the Ten Warriors must be here!</font>

187
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unno...</font>

188
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's your turn!</font>

189
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My prince, I must ask you to die here.</font>

190
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oath of Faith, emissary of Water!</font>

193
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So all of us Last-Namers 
are to be sacrificed to the prince?</font>

194
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he said he will give up 
on the prince if we win.</font>

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Then let's all go after him together!</font>

196
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. Emperor Ramaga won't 
sit idly by if we defy his orders.</font>

197
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me see to this.</font>

198
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you don't want to go?</font>

199
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to lose any more 
comrades if I can help it.</font>

200
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sasuke, so long as Unno is your
 comrade, have faith in him.</font>

201
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They just keep coming!</font>

202
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our only shot is to take down 
the guy controlling them!</font>

203
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kaito, don't get ahead of yourself!</font>

204
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mimic Arrow!</font>

205
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kaito!</font>

206
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have only begun to fight!</font>

207
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it!</font>

208
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine! I'll try again!</font>

209
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop! You can't take him alone!</font>

210
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try to stay calm!</font>

211
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am calm!</font>

212
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah?</font>

213
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look like you're feeling desperate 
and betrayed by your grandma to me.</font>

223
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something's wrong. 
That's not the White Blaze I—</font>

224
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened to you, White Blaze?!</font>

225
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jun!</font>

226
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about me!</font>

227
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all my own fault.</font>

228
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were always there for me, but I...</font>

234
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">keep all at a distance 
and hide yourself away.</font>

235
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd have been cursed if you'd stayed
 with me, so I pushed you away!</font>

236
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I was doing right by you!</font>

237
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I was wrong!</font>

238
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just running away 
without even trying to protect you!</font>

239
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, White Blaze.</font>

300
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,800
