00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could it suddenly disappear?</font>

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way!
Is this the real detective test?</font>

141
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise I'll find it for you!</font>

142
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why have you called us here?</font>

143
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You three were the only people to enter
this room after Mari last saw the tiara.</font>

144
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of you is the culprit
who stole the tiara!</font>

145
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! That's impossible!</font>

146
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

147
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Of course it is...
We just have some questions...</font>

148
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to photograph the bride.</font>

149
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to ask Mari a favor.</font>

150
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A favor?</font>

151
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She wanted me to throw the bouquet to her.</font>

152
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! The bouquet toss!</font>

153
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yes! If you catch the bouquet thrown</i>
<i>by the bride, you'll share her happiness!</i></font>

154
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always dreamed of catching one!</font>

155
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Requests are allowed?</font>

156
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mari, you agreed to do it, didn't you?</font>

157
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tomoka's always late but she came on time,
so I couldn't help myself.</font>

158
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

159
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was in and out,
preparing for the ceremony.</font>

160
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they wearing
the same clothes as earlier?</font>

161
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, there's no way
they could hide a tiara...</font>

162
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so...</font>

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hat!</font>

164
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe he put it in his hat?</font>

165
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

166
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This tiara is roughly
the same size as Mari's.</font>

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-May I see your hat?
-Sure.</font>

168
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't fit.
He couldn't have put it in here.</font>

169
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about Tomoka's bag?</font>

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't fit in there either.</font>

171
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Kono's pouch is too small, too.</font>

172
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

173
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's really okay.</font>

174
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll just have to...</font>

175
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">give up on the tiara.</font>

176
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we can figure out how they took out
the tiara, we'll know the culprit.</font>

177
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just don't know how.</font>

178
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always...</font>

179
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mikuru-chan.</font>

180
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mikuru-chan!</font>

181
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

182
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

183
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't make Mari smile at this rate.</font>

184
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be a star detective.</font>

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you want to be a star detective?</font>

186
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They helped me before.</font>

187
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, I want to become
a star detective and help others!</font>

188
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're amazing!</font>

189
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're a star detective, you can find
the tiara and make Mari smile, right?</font>

190
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, for sure.</font>

191
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then become one! A star detective!</font>

192
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

193
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Worrying about it won't make it happen!</font>

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a single step,
and the answer will follow!</font>

195
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A single step of courage
becomes the answer!</font>

196
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mikuru-chan! Let's go!</font>

197
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go over it all again!</font>

198
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

199
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the second time today!</font>

200
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Earlier today, a girl's ribbon
flew into the hedge...</font>

201
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Inside... the hedge...</font>

202
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flowers?</font>

203
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see!</font>

204
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the answer!</font>

205
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-The culprit is...
-...that person!</font>

206
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know who the culprit is!</font>

207
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who could it be?</font>

208
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The culprit...</font>

209
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is you!</font>

210
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

211
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you saw how the tiara
wouldn't fit in my pouch!</font>

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could never take it out of this room.</font>

213
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

214
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tiara is still in this room.</font>

215
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

216
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You asked Mari to throw
the bouquet to you.</font>

217
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then, you hid the tiara in the bouquet.</i></font>

218
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, when you got the bouquet from Mari,</font>

219
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you planned to remove the tiara.</font>

220
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're good.</font>

221
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you've made one big mistake.</font>

222
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not Tomoka!</font>

223
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Nijee! A thief from
the Phantom Thieves' Guild!</font>

224
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Phantom Thieves' Guild?</font>

225
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wasn't that an amazing disguise?</font>

226
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take that!</font>

227
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tiara!</font>

228
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

229
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh no!</font>

230
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

231
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's fast!</font>

232
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh snap, baby!</font>

233
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give back the tiara!</font>

234
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No can do!</font>

235
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This tiara has
a Makoto Jewel in it, after all.</font>

236
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Makoto Jewel?</font>

237
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bride's deep care for
the tiara drew a Makoto Jewel to it.</font>

238
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our goal is to collect these jewels.</font>

239
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In exchange for the tiara,
I'll put on a special show for you!</font>

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lies, envelop!</font>

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come forth, Hanninda!</font>

242
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanninda!</font>

243
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a Hanninda,
newly developed by Phantom!</font>

244
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's showtime, baby!</font>

245
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanninda!</font>

246
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to do something!</font>

247
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something?</font>

248
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The time to play detective is over!</font>

249
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your fearful eyes say it all.</font>

250
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're no detective.</font>

251
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just a fake,
who pretends to be one!</font>

252
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's the real thing!</font>

253
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mikuru-chan is going to be
a star detective!</font>

254
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Star detective?</font>

255
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never going to happen.</font>

256
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She will!</font>

257
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I want to become
a star detective and help everyone!</font>

258
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She wants to help people!</font>

259
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're playing tough,
but I know you're scared.</font>

260
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true... I'm scared.</font>

261
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm scared, but I want
to get the tiara back.</font>

262
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mari needs help,
and I want to help her too!</font>

263
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Together with Mikuru-chan!</font>

264
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mikuru-chan!</font>

265
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A single step of courage!</font>

266
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Becomes the answer!</font>

267
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show me this answer of yours!</font>

268
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanninda!</font>

269
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll get it back!</font>

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-Huh?
-Whoa!</font>

271
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-Another pendant!
-It's the same?!</font>

272
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Precure!</font>

273
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Open!</font>

274
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jewel Cure Watch!</font>

275
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Precure! Wake-up Time!</font>

276
