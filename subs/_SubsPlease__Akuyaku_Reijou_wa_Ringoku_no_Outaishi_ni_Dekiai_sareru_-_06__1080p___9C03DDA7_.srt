1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you are Tiararose?</font>

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is an honor to meet you, 
Forest Fairy King.</font>

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may call me Keith.</font>

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The forest fairies seem to have 
taken quite a liking to you.</font>

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am grateful and delighted 
to have their favor.</font>

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lift your head.</font>

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting.</font>

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara, your soul is most unusual.</font>

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an2}<font color="#3d8afc"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="28"><b><font color="#f76bb3">The Villainess <font color="#6b3e34">Is <font color="#f76bb3">Adored 
<font color="#6b3e34">by the Prince of the Neighbor Kingdom</font></font></font></font></b></font></font></font></font>

10
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="TimesNewRoman"><font color="#f76bb3"><font size="25"><b>Tiara</b> <font color="#6b3e34">in the <b><font color="#3d8afc">Sleeping Forest</font></b></font></font></font></font></font>

11
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a very unstable soul, 
but also beautiful.</font>

12
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it smells very nice.</font>

13
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">King Keith...</font>

14
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps this is what you smell.</font>

15
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No "King" needed. Simply call me Keith.</font>

16
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

17
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do it.</font>

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-All right...</font>

19
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What an egotistical fairy king!</i></font>

20
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Cookies, eh?</font>

21
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? These contain your magic, I see.</font>

22
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yes. It's not strong magic,</font>

23
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm able to put it 
into the sweets I make.</font>

24
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, they're quite good.</font>

25
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">King Kei—</font>

26
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Keith</i>.</font>

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you like them, Keith.</font>

28
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unlike humans, fairies are free, you know.</font>

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We go by whatever name we like.</font>

31
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it seems.</font>

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I could live like a fairy, as well.</font>

33
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this? Is something troubling you?</font>

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans have many things 
that tie them down.</font>

36
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just thinking about 
how difficult that is.</font>

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Relax.</font>

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything ever happens, 
I'll be your strength.</font>

39
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

40
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for making time 
to meet with me today.</font>

41
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should be thanking you. 
You're always the one helping me out.</font>

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, not at all.</font>

43
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, it's unusual 
for you to turn to Lady Icilla</font>

44
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for matters unrelated to work.</font>

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm referring to the hair accessory.</font>

46
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to give Tiara 
the best there is, after all.</font>

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were even up all night 
coming up with a design yourself.</font>

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You knew about that?</font>

49
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I <i>am</i> your attendant.</font>

50
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I envy Lady Tiararose.</font>

51
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man she loves 
is so genuinely fond of her.</font>

52
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness, it's Tarmo.</font>

53
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enter.</font>

54
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

55
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it? Where's Tiara?</font>

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you are a future queen, then?</font>

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That isn't set in stone yet.</font>

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm only the prince's fiancée.</font>

59
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans are always so difficult.</font>

60
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the future king, isn't he? 
What's he like?</font>

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Prince Aquasteed is very kind</font>

62
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and has the unwavering 
support of his people.</font>

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a far more wonderful man 
than I deserve.</font>

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, what time is it?!</i></font>

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I need to go back!</font>

66
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is the exit?</font>

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take you there.</font>

68
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

69
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My... room?</font>

70
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Leave it to a fairy king.</i></font>

71
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He used that difficult 
teleportation spell so easily.</i></font>

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara!</font>

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?!</font>

74
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get away from Tiara!</font>

75
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be Aquasteed.</font>

76
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be a better match 
for you than this guy.</font>

77
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stop that, Fairy King!</font>

78
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A fairy king?!</i></font>

79
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea you were a fairy king.</font>

80
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for lifting 
my blade against you.</font>

81
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. I forgive you.</font>

82
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in a good mood right now.</font>

83
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Tiararose is my fiancée.</font>

84
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting so close to her</font>

85
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">seems an undignified thing 
for a fairy king to do.</font>

86
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, look at that. 
He sure loves you a lot, Tiara.</font>

87
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's what <i>you</i> did that caused 
his misunderstanding, Keith!</font>

88
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter.</font>

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take my leave for today.</font>

90
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If life gets too hard for you, 
call me anytime.</font>

91
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help you as thanks for the cookies.</font>

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keith...</font>

93
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um...</font>

94
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I...</font>

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tarmo told me.</font>

96
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The forest fairies took you away, right?</font>

97
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes! I'm so sorry for making you worry!</font>

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't get angry with you over that.</font>

99
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, he's definitely angry.</i></font>

100
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think I'm angry, Tiara?</font>

101
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly... I'm so jealous.</font>

102
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-Prince Aqua...</font>

103
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I'm angry, you know.</font>

104
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The name.</font>

105
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Name? Prince Aqua...</font>

106
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I called the fairy king "Keith" 
without any title.</i></font>

107
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is Prince Aqua saying he wants me 
to do the same with him?</i></font>

108
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But is that even allowed?</i></font>

109
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe when it's just the two of us...</i></font>

110
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Aqua.</font>

111
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right answer.</font>

112
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did very well.</font>

113
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, ma'am.</font>

114
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that will be all for today.</font>

115
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! Prince Aquasteed!</font>

116
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like you're done.</font>

117
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Lady Tiararose 
is such a brilliant student</font>

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that she completed six months' 
worth of work in one month.</font>

119
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All that remains is one week of 
lectures on fairies, and we're finished.</font>

120
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. You're so brilliant, Tiara.</font>

121
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you! I'll study my hardest!</font>

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, do you have 
some time after this?</font>

123
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Me?</font>

124
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I want you to see my work 
up close and understand it.</font>

125
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm only your fiancée.</font>

126
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have little knowledge 
of your kingdom's affairs.</font>

127
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a problem.</font>

128
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even as queen, you aren't likely 
to have much involvement in my work,</font>

129
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but knowing about it isn't a bad thing.</font>

130
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

131
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do my best to be useful 
to you, Prince Aqua.</font>

132
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been working 
too hard every evening.</font>

133
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I suggest you stop 
for tonight and rest?</font>

134
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing I can do 
to be useful to Prince Aqua yet.</font>

135
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you've been working 
more than hard enough.</font>

136
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Still, I had no idea</i></font>

137
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>that Lady Icilla was so frequently 
in his office, even if only for work.</i></font>

138
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lady Icilla is only fourteen,</i></font>

139
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>yet she already does such diligent work.</i></font>

140
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How can I be useful to him?</i></font>

141
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it smells lovely!</font>

142
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure your magic sweets will 
relieve the prince's exhaustion.</font>

143
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you. I'll try my best.</font>

144
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning, Tiara!</font>

145
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're making sweets?</font>

146
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can have these!</font>

147
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, nuts and flowers?</font>

148
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Philine, open your mouth.</font>

149
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These flowers from 
the forest fairies are edible.</font>

150
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's delicious! It has its own natural 
sweetness and isn't bitter at all!</font>

151
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

152
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, you baked this for us, Tiara?</font>

153
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you two are working so hard, 
I wanted you to have it.</font>

155
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy you thought of us.</font>

156
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take a short break.</font>

157
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

158
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always make such 
delicious sweets, Tiara.</font>

159
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It tastes wonderful!</font>

160
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is exquisite.</font>

161
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad you all like it.</font>

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in.</font>

163
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

164
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Is this from you, Lady Icilla?</font>

165
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the latest cake recipe 
from our family chef.</font>

166
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you're here now, I wanted 
to offer you something sweet,</font>

167
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but maybe this was poor timing.</font>

168
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all! 
Please, don't worry about that.</font>

169
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's such a beautiful cake.</font>

170
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love sweets, you know!</font>

171
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do look so happy when you eat sweets.</font>

172
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could watch you forever.</font>

173
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll bring some more next time.</font>

174
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a luxurious cake.</font>

175
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which one do you prefer, Prince Aquasteed?</font>

176
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's there to think about?</font>

178
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara's tastes much better.</font>

179
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fairy King!</font>

180
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll come again for some more.</font>

181
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know I told you before</font>

182
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that I would rather you 
didn't touch my fiancée.</font>

183
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, did you?</font>

184
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,960

185
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still eating that cake?</font>

186
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't even care much for sweet foods.</font>

187
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ones Tiara makes are different.</font>

188
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly...</font>

189
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why couldn't you just say 
hers tasted better, then?</font>

190
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to keep Lady Icilla in a good mood.</font>

191
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially while she's in the castle.</font>

192
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that is true...</font>

193
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Lady Icilla's mood is soured,</font>

194
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the sea fairies will feel it, 
and the seas will rage.</font>

195
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But as long as she's happy, the seas 
will share their bounty with us.</font>

196
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More, please.</font>

197
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Again?</font>

198
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The "dripping with handsomeness" CG!</font>

199
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did I forget about that 
until just now?</font>

200
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was the only sample still revealed 
for the sequel before I died,</i></font>

201
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>from an event where Prince Aqua</i></font>

202
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>is walking in the ocean on a date, 
falls in, and gets all wet.</i></font>

203
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua looked so hot.</font>

204
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, no! He was on 
a date with the heroine!</font>

205
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was an event that progressed 
his romance with Icilla!</font>

206
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't guess when that event will happen.</i></font>

207
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I should be fine as long as Prince Aqua 
doesn't go into the ocean with her...</i></font>

208
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? The ocean?</font>

209
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm going to inspect 
Lady Icilla's ocean.</font>

210
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems a new species of coral 
has appeared there.</font>

211
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, no...</i></font>

212
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter?</font>

213
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, nothing.</font>

214
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara.</font>

215
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to hold back with me.</font>

216
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's official business 
for you, isn't it?</font>

217
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't be selfish about...</font>

218
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't finish that sentence.</font>

219
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't stop until you tell me.</font>

220
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please... Please don't go into the ocean!</font>

221
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. I won't go.</font>

222
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

223
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll have Elliot do the inspection.</font>

224
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're more important to me, after all.</font>

225
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua...</font>

226
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Master Elliot will accompany you 
for today's inspection?</font>

227
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Sorry about that.</font>

228
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

229
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will Master Elliot be here soon?</font>

230
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's with the knights right now, 
so we'll go get him.</font>

231
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with us, Tiara.</font>

232
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a lovely rose garden 
along the way.</font>

233
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we see it together?</font>

234
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to!</font>

235
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, how pretty!</font>

236
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're beautiful!</font>

237
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you see any you like, 
you can pick them.</font>

238
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

239
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. Lady Icilla, 
you're also welcome to them.</font>

240
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

241
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, look at these!</font>

242
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These white roses would match 
Lady Tiararose's hair perfectly!</font>

243
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Icilla!</font>

244
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aquasteed!</font>

245
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prince Aqua! Are you all... right...</font>

246
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dripping with handsomeness!</i></font>

247
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No... But that event was 
supposed to happen at the ocean...</i></font>

248
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is the game's power—
the power of the events—absolute?</i></font>

249
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is it impossible for me to change 
the progression of the game?</i></font>

250
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara!</font>

251
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Now I've done it. After I said 
I wouldn't run away anymore...</i></font>

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I can't help feeling anxious.</i></font>

253
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is Prince Aqua's heart 
still leaning toward me?</i></font>

254
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How can I become stronger?</i></font>

255
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's okay.</i></font>

256
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I just keep looking up, 
the tears will dry in no time.</i></font>

257
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keith?!</font>

258
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this? Did he make you cry?</font>

259
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, he didn't!</font>

260
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But your heart is crying.</font>

261
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're suffering, just come to me.</font>

262
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I keep telling you, it's not like...</font>

263
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,100

Fairies are free.</font>

264
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,190

265
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's not here?</font>

266
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,790

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara...</font>

269
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's Tiara!</font>

270
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back, King!</font>

271
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keith! What is the meaning of this?!</font>

272
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, stop howling.</font>

273
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you realize this, Tiara, 
but your face looks awful.</font>

274
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

275
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lie down and rest a while.</font>

276
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not enough sleep?</font>

277
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's bad for your skin!</font>

278
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, um...</font>

279
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take me back! I'll rest in my own room!</font>

280
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think not.</font>

281
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know forest fairies 
are capricious, don't you?</font>

282
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I have my own...</font>

283
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even as vulnerable as you are, I didn't 
think you'd fall asleep <i>that</i> easily.</font>

284
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have really felt terrible.</font>

285
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna take a nap with Tiara!</font>

286
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A consort loved by the forest fairies, eh?</font>

287
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the sea fairies like 
that human called Icilla, don't they?</font>

288
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans can be a headache, 
but those sea fairies are a pain, as well.</font>

289
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They grow extremely attached.</font>

290
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one time a girl 
they loved was in trouble,</font>

291
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the ocean was stained red, 
the fish vanished, and the coral withered.</font>

292
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When was that again?</font>

293
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many centuries ago?</font>

294
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've searched the entire castle, 
but we couldn't find her.</font>

295
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could he abduct Lady Tiararose?</font>

296
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that fairy king thinking?</font>

297
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal family's forbidden texts</font>

298
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">may tell us where the Forest 
Fairy King can be found.</font>

299
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait here for a while.</font>

300
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

301
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. Where is it?</font>

302
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get why there are so 
many records of the oceans,</font>

303
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there are far too few for the forest.</font>

304
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"The path to the Forest Fairy King's 
throne begins in the castle"?</font>

305
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the castle?</font>

306
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The queen's chamber? 
Why would it be there?</font>

307
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fairy King!</font>

308
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. You seem rather desperate.</font>

309
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't think maybe that's because 
you abducted my consort?!</font>

310
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I wasn't planning to at first...</font>

311
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I changed my mind.</font>

312
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fairies are capricious, you know.</font>

313
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough joking around!</font>

314
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not joking.</font>

315
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be taking her.</font>

316
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="TimesNewRoman"><font size="25"><b><font color="#f76bb3">Hold</font></b> <font color="#6b3e34">Me... <b><font color="#3d8afc">Tighter</font></b></font></font></font></font>

317
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="TimesNewRoman"><font size="25"><b><font color="#f76bb3">Hold</font></b> <font color="#6b3e34">Me... <b><font color="#3d8afc">Tighter</font></b></font></font></font></font>

318
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy that Prince 
Aqua says he loves me,</font>

319
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but... that's also why I'm scared.</font>
