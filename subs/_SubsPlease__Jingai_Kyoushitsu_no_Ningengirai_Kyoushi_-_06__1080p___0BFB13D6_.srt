<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isaki and I are thinking 
of becoming two separate humans.</font>

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Separate humans?</font>

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At first, the plan was 
to become one human,</font>

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to stop living a halfhearted 
existence as a werewolf...</font>

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But after talking things over,</font>

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we don't see a need to merge 
into a single personality.</font>

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean you'll 
each have your own body?</font>

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that even possible?!</font>

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When we enrolled, the director 
told us that was an option.</font>

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to think it'd be better 
if I didn't exist.</font>

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But after starting 
an exchange diary with Isaki,</font>

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we want to be there for each other.</font>

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, I'll discuss it 
with the principal and director.</font>

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much!</font>

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what will you do 
after you become humans?</font>

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until now, you were planning to enter 
a private liberal arts university.</font>

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now with two Ohgamis

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,240

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,010

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

27
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think about that at all!</font>

28
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,830

36
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to graduate and become human, 
you need to pass the final assignment.</font>

37
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The principal and director will prepare 
a personalized task for each of you.</font>

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of that matters to me.</font>

39
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got 150 points deducted 
for sneaking off campus.</font>

40
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's no point in doing 
the final assignment.</font>

41
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"The final assignment</font>

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is meant to challenge you
in ways that a class can't teach."</font>

43
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or so the principal said.</font>

44
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graduation or not, 
you'll have to do the assignment.</font>

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have until the end 
of February to submit it.</font>

46
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you all to do 
your best to complete it.</font>

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've just received our final 
assignments from the principal.</font>

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mine is to hunt down 
one of the director's gems.</font>

49
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A treasure hunt?</font>

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This contains hints to the gem's location.</font>

51
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font color="#fbfeff"><font face="Arial"><font size="22">Final Assignment

52
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,630

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for me,</font>

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to collect the signatures of 
every enrolled student and faculty member.</font>

55
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Signatures?</font>

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So they just write down their names?</font>

57
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're treating me like I'm stupid.</font>

58
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This should be easy.</font>

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mine is writing the sports anthem 
for our field day next year.</font>

60
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds perfect

66
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pretty good, if you ask me.</font>

67
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm done with the melody 
and the lyrics for the chorus.</font>

68
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're working on the lyrics 
and music at the same time?</font>

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to nail the chorus first 
since it's the key part,</font>

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then build out the rest from there.</font>

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh, now that's an interesting approach.</font>

72
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about you, Usami?</font>

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've already talked to every student.</font>

74
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's impossible.</font>

75
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

76
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look.</font>

77
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are these... paw prints?</font>

78
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The beginner class is still getting 
used to their human forms,</font>

79
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and a lot of the students can't write yet.</font>

80
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got their paw prints, but the principal
said they don't count as signatures.</font>

81
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The beginner class won't be easy...</font>

82
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are you doing, Ohgami?</font>

83
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would they say this?</font>

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why? I can't understand how they feel!</font>

85
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like you're struggling, too.</font>

86
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's your assignment going, Minazuki?</font>

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first hint was a crossword puzzle, 
which I found hard but managed to solve.</font>

88
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

89
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The next one's just as difficult, 
and I'm still figuring it out.</font>

90
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure I'll manage to get it, though!</font>

91
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I solved the first one.</font>

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

93
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's still more than a month left.</font>

94
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't stress out and panic.</font>

95
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just keep on chipping away. Got it?</font>

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I might enjoy 
coming up with stories.</font>

135
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's great!</font>

136
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's embarrassing to ask, 
but would you care to read it?</font>

137
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure!</font>

142
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I spent so much time teaching them 
to write, day in and day out.</font>

143
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some ran away.</font>

144
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some were scared.</font>

145
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some set up traps for me.</font>

146
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a royal pain.</font>

147
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. You worked really hard.</font>

148
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

149
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka, how's your assignment going?</font>

150
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, if there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to ask for help!</font>

151
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're too kind.</font>

152
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, it's my assignment, 
so I'll do my best by myself.</font>

153
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I learned the hard way!</font>

154
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't put your feelings into words,
they won't get through!</font>

155
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So perhaps I may be acting out of line...</font>

156
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you need help, 
feel free to ask at any time!</font>

157
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I'll ask when the time is right.</font>

158
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka!</font>

159
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me what part 
you're having trouble with!</font>

160
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help you out!</font>

161
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for offering.</font>

162
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, this assignment is 
for me to solve, so I'll be just fine.</font>

163
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can tell it's fake.</font>

164
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

165
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never liked the way you smile.</font>

166
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It reminds me of the person I love, 
forcing a smile on her face.</font>

167
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I simply hold pride 
in always staying positive.</font>

168
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forced as it may be, it is my wish 
to challenge myself and overcome this.</font>

169
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's no problem at all.</font>

170
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That attitude's what ticks me off!</font>

171
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usami.</font>

172
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

173
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is the point of this assignment 
not to overcome it yourself?</font>

174
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate the concern you've shown me, 
but please understand.</font>

175
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always try and handle 
everything on your own.</font>

176
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be able to ask for help 
when you really need it?</font>

177
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

178
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no need for your help.</font>

179
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,640

182
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,880

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning!</font>

184
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, Ohgami.</font>

185
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, is today the full moon?</font>

186
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka and Ushami are fighting, no cap?</font>

187
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you make 
of the situation with Kyoka?</font>

188
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:57,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's important to admit 
when you can't do something by yourself.</font>

189
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

190
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

191
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma, you ever takopa'd?</font>

192
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Takopa?</font>

193
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't find octopus on short notice, 
so there's konjac in it instead.</font>

194
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't any seafood in konjac,
so I can eat without hesitation.</font>

195
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The idea's that if you chat while 
cooking and eating all together,</font>

196
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you can ask about real 
heavy stuff, no prob!</font>

197
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No prob, huh?</font>

198
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plan number one.</font>

199
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:37,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make Kyoka think that I have zero clue,
and figure out where she's stuck.</font>

200
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, how's the assignment going, Kyoka?</font>

201
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right off the bat?!</i></font>

202
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say I'm making progress.</font>

203
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, for real?</font>

204
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your assignment, anyway?</font>

205
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mine is a treasure hunt.</font>

206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like fun!</font>

207
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you do?</font>

208
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You solve puzzles one by one.</font>

209
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's not just one problem?</font>

210
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

211
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first one was a crossword puzzle, 
and the solution was "Gotemba".</font>

214
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They have an outlet mall there!</font>

215
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And? What's the second problem?</font>

216
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, well, you see...</font>

218
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, is the second 
one, like, <i>super</i> hard?!</font>

219
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some kinda crazy math problem?</font>

220
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isaki just can't with math!</font>

221
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second appears 
to be some sort of riddle.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try and remember.</font>

227
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The very first class.</font>

228
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when you trace them in order...</font>

229
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what it says.</font>

230
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I looked up the first class for beginner, 
intermediate, and advanced levels,</font>

231
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I couldn't figure it out.</font>

232
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was our first class 
for the beginner level?</font>

233
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A tour of the school.</font>

234
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After the tour, they handed out 
a hiragana worksheet.</font>

235
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then we introduced ourselves.</font>

236
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The beginner class starts by learning 
about writing and speaking.</font>

237
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

238
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka, do you remember 
our first introductions?</font>

239
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our first introductions?</font>

240
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your name and the reason 
you want to be human.</font>

241
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to become human to repay 
the kindness a human showed me.</font>

242
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I also want to 
help the people around me.</font>

243
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so...</font>

244
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka, I'm sorry about what I said!</font>

245
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

246
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't thinking about how you felt, 
wanting to do your best.</font>

247
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanted to help.</font>

248
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For my own satisfaction.</font>

249

250
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, don't say that.</font>

251
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not at fault here, Usami.</font>

252
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should also...</font>

253
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

254
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Minazuki.</font>

255
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know...</font>

256
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do anything 
without depending on others.</font>

257
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even for stuff I was asked to do, 
I often find I can't do it alone.</font>

258
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's a really important skill to

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The box is safe as well!</font>

386
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much.</font>

387
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations!</font>

388
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like everyone in the advanced class 
has finished their final assignments!</font>

389
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Principal, my apologies 
for taking so long.</font>

390
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would not have been able to 
complete this assignment alone.</font>

391
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I was able to see it through 
thanks to my wonderful friends.</font>

392
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As such...</font>

393
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:49,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please distribute my points equally among 
the four of us in our class.</font>

394
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once again...</font>

395
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations!</font>

396
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With this, all of your graduation 
assignments have been submitted.</font>

397
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we have decided which students meet 
the requirements to graduate.</font>

398
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will have one student 
graduating this year.</font>

399
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She has no violations on record, 
and has consistently acquired points.</font>

400
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A student with the clear academic 
and social skills to survive among humans.</font>

401
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, she could never muster 
the courage to rely on others.</font>

402
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A student adamant on doing 
everything by herself.</font>

403
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But by relying on others 
for her graduation assignment,</font>

404
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she finally learned to become a bother.</font>

405
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For these reasons stated, 
the one graduating will be...</font>

406
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka Minazuki.</font>

407
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one.</font>

408
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much!</font>
