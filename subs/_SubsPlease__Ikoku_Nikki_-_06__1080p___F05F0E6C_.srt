53
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah...</font>

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'll clean up in half an hour.</font>

55
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,230

56
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh...</font>

57
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now's not a good time.</font>

58

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I've been wondering

59
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How does it even get like this?</font>

60
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're always
 forgetting what I tell you!</font>

61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that? Why can't you 
do something so simple?</font>

62
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why can't I do something so simple?</font>

63
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay. Don't be so down on yourself.</font>

64
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No worries. 
A lot of novelists are like you.</font>

65
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although it <i>can</i> get you 
into trouble with your taxes.</font>

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that sounds a lot like me.</font>

67
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you mean that was mandatory?</font>

68
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, um... I don't understand 
this system very well...</font>

69
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio? Makio!</font>

70
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

71
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you even listening to me?</font>

72
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh... I guess not really.</font>

73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Darn you.</font>

74
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My bad.</font>

75
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio, did you do your homework?</font>

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio-san?</font>

77
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio.</font>

78
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio!</font>

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-H-Hang on...</font>

80
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me a minute...</font>

81
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you need to get that upset?</font>

82
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm only stating the obvious.</font>

83
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What upsets me is up to me!</font>

84
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't get to decide that for me!</font>

85
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's "obvious" to you 
doesn't come so readily to me.</font>

86
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My mind is constantly busy.</font>

87
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I easily lose sight of things.</font>

88
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a terrible liar.</font>

89
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm more comfortable alone.</font>

90
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For whatever reason, I was born this way.</font>

91
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like how you were born 
to hate being alone.</font>

92
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not something you get to choose
 or shame others for.</font>

93
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like you can't understand 
the suffocation I feel,</font>

94
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't understand your loneliness.</font>

95
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

96
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm sorry. 
I have plans with Asa today.</font>

97
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is today Saturday?</font>

98
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

99
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, can Emiri come over on Saturday?</font>

100
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm...</font>

101
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Saturday already?</font>

102
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on in.</font>

103
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something smells good.</font>

104
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I was feeling on edge,
so I'm baking a cake.</font>

105
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feeling on edge?</font>

106
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, where's Asa?</font>

107
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She said she's at the convenience store.</font>

108
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't notice?</font>

109
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She may have mentioned it, 
but I can't say for certain.</font>

110
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one's your standard tea. 
And here are a couple of flavored ones.</font>

111
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I also have black bean tea, green tea,
roasted brown rice tea... That's expired.</font>

112
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, and milk. Have whatever you'd like.</font>

113
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing is also an option.</font>

114
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean I get to choose?</font>

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

116
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's taking that girl so long?</font>

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one, huh? You got it.</font>

118
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... Why aren't you married?</font>

119
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

120
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not, are you?</font>

121
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well, no.</font>

122
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you ask?</font>

123
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just that...</font>

124
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My parents keep telling me 
I'll get married one day, but...</font>

125
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not saying this 
just because I'm single,</font>

126
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I don't think it's "normal" to be 
married or "weird" to be unmarried.</font>

127
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Naturally, same goes 
for not <i>wanting</i> to get married.</font>

128
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that I don't want to, but...</font>

129
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, then what about someone you like?</font>

130
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have anyone like that?</font>

131
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure.</font>

132
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?!</font>

133
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I have someone who
I consider a friend...</font>

134
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine just being friends.</font>

135
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If being your boyfriend makes you hate me,</font>

136
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd rather go back to being friends.</font>

137
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, don't push me away...</font>

138
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back! Sorry about that, Emiri!</font>

139
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asa!</font>

140
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess what? Makio-san and I 
were just talking about love.</font>

141
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? No way! You mean Kasamachi-kun?</font>

142
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Who's Kasamachi-kun?</font>

143
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You call him that?</font>

144
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's personal, so I'm not telling.</font>

145
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}But you told Emiri!</font>

146
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, the cake's done.</font>

147
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want cake.</font>

148
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It needs to cool down first.</font>

149
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once it's cool enough to touch, 
you can take it out of the pan.</font>

150
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll taste better once fully cooled.</font>

151
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

152
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it smells so good.</font>

153
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno if I can wait.</font>

154
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me either!</font>

155
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry I'm late.</font>

156
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a little pampered, 
but I promise he's a good guy.</font>

157
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that for? Cut me some slack.</font>

158
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is beer okay?</font>

159
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

160
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll order some other stuff for us too.</font>

161
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,110

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang on. Where's this feeling coming from?</font>

170
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, a-are you okay?</font>

177
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,560

178
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see... I dunno.</font>

180
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Sorry, more on that some other time.</font>

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,750

235
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And with summer break now, 
you don't have to cook.</font>

236
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Between making bento boxes

237
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure which is more

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bet I do. What of it?</font>

241
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,330

245
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need some beer to go with this.</font>

246
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,550

254
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I wouldn't call it that.</font>

255
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just like working out. That's all.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So I go to the gym because 
I like working out, right?</font>

259
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}And I make bento boxes 
of what I want to eat.</font>

260
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Has he always been this... hot?</i></font>

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So someone goes, "You sure love taking 
care of yourself, Kasamachi-san!"</font>

262
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's gotta be a dig, right?</font>

263
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking care of yourself?</font>

264
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, here's your gyoza.</font>

265
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've always been the target 
of that kind of slander.</font>

266
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, teasing, I guess.</font>

267
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, the whole "pampered" thing.</font>

268
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because you look like you 
can take it. That's why.</font>

269
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a little pampered, 
but I promise he's a good guy.</font>

270
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, with people pointing fingers at you,
 you can't help feeling it's a dig.</font>

271
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good times.</font>

272
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I appreciated that you didn't 
pile on and tease me too.</font>

273
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't?</font>

274
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makes sense. I like pampered guys.</font>

275
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

276
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, um... You never told me that.</font>

277
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have anyone like that?</font>

278
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Snap out of it!</i></font>

279
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of pampered guys...</font>

280
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's that young attorney of yours?</font>

281
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

282
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He seemed pretty pampered too.</font>

283
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just wondering if I could 
speak with Asa-san alone.</font>

284
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I wanted to make sure I'm not 
overstepping any boundaries.</font>

285
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's your typical eager beaver.</font>

286
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eager beaver? That's a rough nickname.</font>

287
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I took the liberty of reading 
through some of your novels.</font>

288
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, he doesn't read 
any fiction whatsoever.</font>

289
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

290
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, why thank you...</font>

291
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>To be honest, I don't read novels, 
so I couldn't understand them.</i></font>

292
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Are middle schoolers your 
main target readers?</i></font>

293
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You said you don't read novels?</font>

294
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right. Not at all.</i></font>

295
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all?</font>

296
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Or movies or manga.</i></font>

297
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Anything of the sort.</i></font>

298
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see. So you don't require much 
storytelling in your life.</i></font>

299
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

300
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, it's fine. Some people don't need it.</i></font>

301
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Need what? Storytelling?</font>

302
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What for?</font>

303
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>For me, stories were like 
friends that gave me refuge.</i></font>

304
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Especially as a child.</i></font>

305
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Refuge...?</font>

306
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like someone introducing me
 to a foreign land.</font>

307
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A foreign land, you say?</i></font>

308
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

309
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, more on that some other time.</font>

310
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I take it he's not your type, then?</font>

311
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

312
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I guess not.</font>

313
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, can I order this thing 
with chives and mochi?</font>

314
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which one?</font>

315
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, looks good.</font>

316
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what about this one? The bok choy?</font>

317
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Cool it.</i></font>

318
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This isn't right...</i></font>

319
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I mean, he's... He's...</i></font>

320
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Treat him right.</font>

321
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's your friend.</font>

322
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I want some!</font>

323
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Go away, damn it!</i></font>

324
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm the one who broke his heart 
and hurt him to begin with.</i></font>

325
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Can we get two more beers?</font>

326
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}As well as the chive and mochi 
stir fry and the bok choy.</font>

327
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I couldn't possibly...</i></font>

328
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wouldn't understand, Kasamachi-kun!</font>

329
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I have the last gyoza?</font>

330
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sure.</font>

331
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't have the right to fall for him...</i></font>

332
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not again.</i></font>

333
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna take a stroll around 
the park and walk this off?</font>

334
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must really love 
taking care of yourself.</font>

335
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Are you trying to make me cry?</font>

336
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you? Do you exercise?</font>

337
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really. Actually, not at all.</font>

338
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll have to drag you out 
for a walk every now and then.</font>

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking back now, I used 
to be in much better shape.</font>

340
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Told you.</font>

341
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I go on walks alone, 
my mind starts to wander.</font>

342
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nice to walk with someone 
and talk for a change.</font>

343
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just for a change, huh?</font>

344
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. You know me too well.</font>

345
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it took me long enough to get here.</font>

346
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should've gotten some coffee to go.</font>

347
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too bad there isn't 
a coffee shop around here.</font>

348
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sorry. Did you not want to?</font>

349
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, it's not that.</font>

350
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I'm dying to.</font>

351
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? R-R-Really?</font>

352
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, thanks, I think?</font>

353
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh! I'm just so confused!</font>

354
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, what's wrong?</font>

355
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Confused about what?</font>

356
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're important to me.</font>

357
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're also my friend.</font>

358
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like I'm sullying that.</font>

359
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see you're overthinking things again.</font>

360
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll regret it if I don't 
think things through.</font>

361
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you don't need to.</font>

362
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can stay friends. 
I won't meddle in your business.</font>

363
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we desire each other, then fine.</font>

364
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we'll lean on each other
 in times of need.</font>

365
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's that sound?</font>

366
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that way too unfair to you?</font>

367
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's not. Actually, 
it's more unfair to you.</font>

368
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you to need me around somehow.</font>

369
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that I want you to be down, of course.</font>

370
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why can't I do something so simple?</i></font>

371
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't deserve help from anyone.</font>

372
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I keep thinking.</font>

373
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you say something so sad?</font>

374
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, sorry, sorry!</font>

375
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn, here I go again, 
making the same mistake.</font>

376
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so hard...</font>

377
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is.</font>

378
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Treating someone right...</i></font>

379
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's such a simple, difficult thing.</i></font>

380
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, you've always smelled nice.</font>

381
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever since we first met.</font>

382
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Other men don't smell like this.</font>

383
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do they?</font>

384
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't.</font>
