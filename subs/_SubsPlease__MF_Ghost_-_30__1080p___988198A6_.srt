but things seem to have settled down.</font>

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That just leaves the matter of my nephew.
 And that's for me to handle.</font>

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to imagine your parents
 aren't thrilled.</font>

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,320

when I visit them in the fall, though.</font>

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, I was his surgeon.</font>

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,200

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,050

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,010

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're a famous surgeon from 
Gunma University Hospital. Stop being silly.</i></font>

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Niigata was a lot of fun, huh?</font>

18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sure was.</font>

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Usually, when I go to Grandma's house,
 it's with my parents,</font>

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so without them there, 
it was totally different.</font>

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, you had Kanata-san 
all to yourself for four whole days.</font>

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, uh, technically, I guess?</font>

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I took a bunch of funny pictures.</font>

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I snapped him sleeping, 
and playing with a huge dragonfly.</font>

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll show you later.</font>

27
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?</font>

28
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care when my summer
 ends now. Zero regrets.</font>

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say that. My summer's 
been a total bust so far.</font>

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go to the beach, yeah? 
It <i>is</i> summer, after all.</font>

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's just one thing 
I'm worried about.</font>

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really like wearing 
a swimsuit around other people.</font>

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me? Aren't you an MFG Angel?</font>

34
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those costumes are 
way more risqué than most swimsuits.</font>

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ask yourself: why do girls like us 
change into swimsuits?</font>

36
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not to show off to other people.</font>

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We do it purely to get a suntan, 
to go swimming, and to enjoy life!</font>

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's 100% a selfish act!</font>

39
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Worrying about what 
anyone else thinks is stupid!</font>

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're totally right.</i></font>

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't often hear compelling 
arguments from you, Wakana.</font>

42
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It shows how right I am.</font>

43
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You take charge on this one,
 Ren, and pick a date.</font>

44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll invite Yuka, too, 
so you invite Kanata-san.</font>

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're inviting Kanata?!</font>

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

47
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think 
I bought a cute swimsuit?</font>

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So what you're saying 
is you're a hypocrite.</i></font>

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You wanted to show off all along.</i></font>

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Niigata was that much fun, huh?</font>

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to hear it, Kanata.</font>

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had such a good time, 
it all feels so surreal looking back.</font>

53
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the rice in Niigata is amazing.</font>

54
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was like every individual grain
glistened like jewelry.</font>

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It had such a sweet aroma, too.</font>

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel I may have gotten a glimpse 
at the true depths of Japanese cuisine.</font>

57
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds impressive. 
Even I've never eaten anything like that.</font>

58
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ren's grandmother was 
so brilliant and lovely.</font>

59
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite her size, she came across
 as really big and strong.</font>

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone in Ren's family 
is so kind and amazing.</font>

61
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And with all of those people
 around her to love her,</font>

62
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's no wonder Ren turned into
 such a lovely young lady.</font>

63
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That sure makes it sound like 
you're in love with her, man.</i></font>

64
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if she <i>is</i> still a bit spoiled.</font>

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know what you mean. 
She'll just hit you out of the blue.</font>

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? It's Ren.</font>

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Hello.</font></font>

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, swimming at the beach?</font>

69
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're inviting me? I'm not sure.</font>

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I took four days off to go to Niigata, 
so I can't take any more time off this week.</font>

71
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're going to the beach?</i></font>

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Next week, maybe? 
Wednesday or Friday would be fine.</font>

73
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll plan for Wednesday.</font>

74
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, Kanata, where are you? 
At Ogatacchi's place?</font>

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can invite him, too. 
It's better to have a few guys around.</font>

76
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll keep the nanpa artists away.</font>

77
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See ya.</font>

78
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to the beach with Ren-chan,
 one of the Angels?!</font>

79
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Personal space, Ogata-san.</font>

80
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I'm so jealous!</font>

81
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some of her friends are coming, too,
so she asked me to invite you along.</font>

82
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say what?! <i>I</i> get to go, too?!</font>

83
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please come. I can barely even talk
 to girls who aren't Ren.</font>

84
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might seem sociable at my job, 
but that's just being in work mode.</font>

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I'll come. But why invite me?</font>

86
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something about "nanpa" artists.</font>

87
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's "nanpa," anyway?</font>

88
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's when guys go up to girls 
and it's obvious they only want one thing.</font>

89
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a real playboy thing.</font>

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">I see. <font face="Trebuchet MS">A girl hunt. 
They do that in England, too.</font></font></font>

91
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Going for a swim with 
a bunch of nubile schoolgirls?</i></font>

92
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ah, it's so good to be alive!</i></font>

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This might be the first 
bittersweet summer of my entire life!</i></font>

94
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, Ogata-san! I think your life might be
 in danger! That's an awful lot of blood!</font>

95
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honey! Honey, where are you?</font>

96
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it? Did you 
run home in this heat?</font>

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got bad news.</font>

98
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just got a call from Kaede-san.</font>

99
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Katagiri Ken died at Gunma's
university hospital just last month.</font>

100
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no.</font>

101
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are we going to tell Kana-chan?</font>

102
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be tough, but I'll tell him
 when he gets back.</font>

103
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, it's just...</font>

104
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My head is a mess. 
I don't know what to think.</font>

105
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry we weren't able 
to track him down sooner.</font>

106
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me, Kanata-kun. 
I wasn't much help at all.</font>

107
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true. Please don't 
say things like that, Papa Saionji.</font>

108
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did your best. 
I'm truly grateful to you.</font>

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kanata.</font>

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your father had a much younger sister.</font>

111
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Katagiri Kaede-san works at 
the university hospital in Gunma.</font>

112
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess that makes her your aunt.</font>

113
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She said she'd like to talk with you.</font>

114
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you go to Gunma to see her?</font>

115
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will. I'll go anywhere if it means 
getting answers about my father.</font>

116
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to be okay 
on your own, Kana-chan?</font>

117
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Papa could go with you if you want.</font>

118
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need to worry, Mama Mayuko.</font>

119
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate the sentiment, 
but I'll go on my own.</font>

120
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, Papa Saionji has work,</font>

121
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you have art classes to teach.
You should both focus on those.</font>

122
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. Go to work, Dad.</font>

123
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go. I'll make the trip 
to Gunma with Kanata.</font>

124
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

125
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Ren might be perfect for this.</font>

126
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's leave it to her.</font>

127
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you mind Ren coming 
along, Kanata-kun?</font>

128
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm worried. I'm not sure how much help
 Ren can actually offer him.</font>

129
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wouldn't be any different if I went.</font>

130
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But having someone with him 
who he trusts and can talk to...</font>

131
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that sense, 
Ren might be the better choice.</font>

132
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know we like to think 
of her as a child still,</font>

133
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but before we realized it, 
she's grown up quite a bit.</font>

134
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nice to meet you. I'm Katagiri Kaede.</font>

135
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be Kanata. 
I could tell at a glance.</font>

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seeing you up close, 
you look a lot like Katherine.</font>

137
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But from a distance, 
you looked exactly like my brother.</font>

138
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When he was young, he had the same body
 language and way of carrying himself.</font>

139
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's funny how blood ties work.</font>

140
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'm Saionji Ren.</font>

141
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came with Kanata.</font>

142
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's nice to meet you. 
You must be Saionji-san's daughter.</font>

143
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a cute companion you have.</font>

144
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry. I know you came all this way,
 but I don't have a lot of time.</font>

145
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="Arial Black"><font size="20">Takasaki Station East Entrance</font></font></font>

146
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go talk at a café nearby.</font>

147
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My brother had cancer.</font>

148
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And by the time he was hospitalized, 
it was too late for effective treatment.</font>

149
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was past the point of surgery 
doing anything for him.</font>

150
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Considering how advanced it was, 
his symptoms must have been severe.</font>

151
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But instead of listening 
to the warnings from his body,</font>

152
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he buried his head in his work.</font>

153
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just how he was. 
So stupidly stoic.</font>

154
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of work did my father do?</font>

155
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a busshi. 
Do you know what that is?</font>

156
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're artists who make statues
 of Buddhist figures.</font>

157
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Impressive.</font>

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My father didn't know 
I was in Japan, did he?</font>

159
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, he did.</font>

160
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

161
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried more than once 
to convince him to contact you,</font>

162
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he wouldn't listen.</font>

163
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he didn't know what to say to you.
 And I can understand why.</font>

164
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He left when you were still young,</font>

165
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and felt in no position 
to call himself your father.</font>

166
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he still watched your races
 and cheered you on.</font>

167
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the hospital bed
 for the first and second races.</font>

168
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when qualifying for the third race
got underway, he was already in a coma.</font>

169
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He actually passed away 
on the day of the race.</font>

170
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you could, I'd like to know 
the exact time my father died.</font>

171
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would've been at 1:09PM on July 16th.</font>

172
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was when I was in the middle
 of the Manazuru race.</font>

173
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At around the start of the third lap.</font>

174
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Could it be?</i></font>

175
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if something happens and 
you need help, I bet she'll be there.</font>

176
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kanata?</font>

177
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was my father I could feel back there.</i></font>

178
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The one helping me during the race.</i></font>

179
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't cry, Kanata.</font>

180
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:01,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, did he leave any kind of message 
or letter? Anything at all for Kanata?</font>

181
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to my knowledge, no.</font>

182
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry. My brother 
treated you awfully.</font>

183
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I got to meet you.</font>

184
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This might be presumptuous of me, 
but would you be willing to meet my parents?</font>

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think they'd be thrilled,</font>

186
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">considering you're their 
only grandchild at the moment.</font>

187
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His ashes and memorial portrait 
are at their house, too.</font>

188
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you lit incense for him, 
I bet he'd rest easier.</font>

189
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like for you to see 
some of his pieces, too.</font>

190
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't bring myself 
to ask him to forgive you.</i></font>

191
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I could sense 
a deep sadness from that boy.</i></font>

192
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's something for you 
to be proud about, Ken.</i></font>

193
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kanata-san doesn't resent you 
the way you thought he would.</i></font>

194
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Using the Katagiri family name
 proves that more than anything.</i></font>

195
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In movies or on TV,</i></font>

196
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>there's always some kind of final message 
to the protagonist from the deceased.</i></font>

197
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But that's just a convenient 
dramatic device to make people cry.</i></font>

198
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Despite knowing that, 
I still wish it happened for real.</i></font>

199
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Because Kanata came to Japan
 to meet his dad.</i></font>

200
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He was reaching out this whole time,
 hoping to make contact.</i></font>

201
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both of my parents are gone.</font>

202
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I really am alone now.</font>

203
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say that.</font>

204
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not alone, Kanata.</font>

205
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We all love you.
Mom and Dad, in particular.</font>

206
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I do, too!</font>

207
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here for you! 
I'll always be there for you!</font>

208
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please cheer up.</font>

209
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why is she so sad?</i></font>

210
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And for my sake, not her own.</i></font>

211
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But there's something so warm about it.</i></font>

212
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even though my shirt is wet with her tears,
 it doesn't bother me at all.</i></font>

213
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When I take a deep breath, I can smell 
the sweet scent of her dark hair.</i></font>

214
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's almost enough

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in terms of downhill racing,</font>

251
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fujiwara Takumi would push it
even harder than I just did.</font>

252
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guy was a total head case, 
with more than a few screws missing.</font>

253
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Katagiri Kanata takes after him.</font>

254
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave a gap, and it's your funeral.</font>

255
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn, boss. I'm still shaking 
from how intense that was.</font>

256
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I gotta incorporate this into my driving 
while I've still got a feel for it.</font>

257
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make it mine, no matter what.</font>

258
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, man. I'm here visiting old 
stomping grounds with the wife and kid.</font>

259
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what am I doing up 
in the mountains so late at night?</font>

260
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Matsumoto.
 I don't know if you've heard yet,</font>

261
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but my brother's getting married.</font>

262
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? That's great news, 
albeit a little sudden.</font>

263
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hadn't heard anything.</font>

264
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He only told me about it today.</font>

265
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the kind of big news that'll turn
 the Gunma Connection on its head.</font>

266
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People are gonna flip.</font>

267
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Nobody figured he'd do something 
as pedestrian as get married.</font>

268
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That other ditz got married last year, too.</font>

269
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess we're all getting older.</font>

270
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if we don't always act like it.</font>

271
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a poll on this MFG fan site about
the most exciting moment of the race.</font>

272
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For last week's Manazuru race,</font>

273
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the top two moments are tied.
 Isn't that something?</font>

274
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you ended up
 winning that race, Michael.</font>

in a bad mood. I wonder why.</i></font>

277

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My aim was to run a race 
that would be boring to watch,</i></font>

278
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and have a predictable outcome.</i></font>

279
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What is this? Why am I so frustrated?</i></font>

280
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When I was battling Sawatari 
and the young driver in the 86,</i></font>

281
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I felt a kind of excitement 
I'd never experienced before.</i></font>

282
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It made me feel accomplished 
for winning in MFG,</i></font>

283
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>a motorsport I'd never 
taken seriously before.</i></font>

284
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How am I supposed 
to deal with these feelings?</i></font>

285
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ko-kun, you should swim, too. 
The water's nice and cold.</font>

286
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is pretty ritzy, right? 
A garden pool at a hotel in the city.</font>

287
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet my friends will be so jealous. 
I should post a pic and brag.</font>

288
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sana's hips are so hot. 
She's a real find.</i></font>

289
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it? Did you get turned on by 
how good I look in my bikini, Ko-kun?</font>

290
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna head inside?</font>

291
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, hang on. I'm not gonna 
last the day if we start this early.</font>

292
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, gotta finish what we start.</font>

293
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'll admit, thinking about it
 <i>has</i> kinda put me in the mood.</font>

294
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same here.</font>

295
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess we should head inside.</font>

296
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a busshi?</font>

297
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The more I hear, the more a decision
 like that sounds just like Ken.</font>

298
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I met him in a sculpting class at art school,</font>

299
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and his works always had 
such intensity to them.</font>

300
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mom. There's something 
I'm wondering about.</font>

301
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promised Wakana and some others
 we'd go to the beach,</font>

302
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and Kanata was supposed 
to come, too...</font>

303
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But after everything that's happened, 
I don't think he'll be in the mood.</font>

304
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even I'm not. Not really.</font>

305
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think I should cancel it?</font>

306
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you should go.</font>

307
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How come?</font>

308
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kana-chan could use a change of pace.</font>

309
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I honestly think you should drag him along.</font>

310
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I don't want to be a bother to him.</font>

311
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won't be bothered.</font>

312
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know full well 
Kana-chan isn't like that.</font>

313
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you think it'll help him,
 you should do it.</font>

314
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder.</i></font>

315
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In that case, I'd better go buy a swimsuit.</i></font>

316
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Coming to Japan may have been
 a moment of destiny for me.</i></font>

317
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When Mum died, 
I lost all direction in life.</i></font>

318
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I went into my shell,
and wallowed in my solitude.</i></font>

319
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In my loneliness, 
I may have just wanted attention.</i></font>

320
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Like a spoiled child.</i></font>

321
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I could've fallen into that same spiral
 after what I learned.</i></font>

322
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But that didn't happen, Mum. 
Does that mean I've grown some?</i></font>

323
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Here in Japan, where the people 
are so kind, I met a girl named Ren.</i></font>

324
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She pulled me back from the brink.</i></font>

325
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I have something important 
to tell you, Mum.</i></font>

326
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dad gave me a present.</i></font>

327
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Can you believe it? 
It was a miracle.</i></font>

328
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dad helped me out during a race.</i></font>

329
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:02,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I may never get the chance 
to speak with him now, but I'm still happy.</i></font>

330
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Because for as short of a time as it was,
 Daddy and I were in sync.</i></font>

331
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I just know I felt his warmth.</i></font>

332
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You can be harsh at times, 
so please don't be too hard on Daddy.</i></font>

333
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I hope you two get along this time.</i></font>

334
