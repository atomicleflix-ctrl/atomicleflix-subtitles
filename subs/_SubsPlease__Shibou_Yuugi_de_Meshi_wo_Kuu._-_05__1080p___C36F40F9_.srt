00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Yuki, written with 
the characters for ghost and oni.</font>

00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was my 27th cleared game. 
I'm closing in on 30.</font>

<font face="Georgia" size="20"><b></b>{\an9}<font size="12">Why did you start playing?</font></font>

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At first, I wanted money.</font>

6
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was chronically broke.</font>

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was scouted by management, 
I decided to participate.</font>

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. After a few times, I had enough money.</font>

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I didn't quit playing.</font>

10

<font face="Georgia" size="20"><b></b>{\an9}<font size="12">Why?</font></font>

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought that maybe I could keep doing this.</font>

12
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I'm risking my life, 
it pays decently well.</font>

13
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured I could make a living doing this.</font>

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll probably die eventually 
if I keep playing,</font>

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,740

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was fine with me.</font>

17
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,460
<font face="Georgia" size="20"><b></b>{\an9}<font size="12">What about now?</font></font>

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for waiting.</font>

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Susuki grass for a ghost? 
Don't you think that's simplistic?</font>

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't told you the name 
of the next game yet.</font>

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, it's Ghost House.</font>

24
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That around 30 games, veterans let

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's possible.</font>

26
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's also possible that you'll perform worse</font>

27
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because I drew your attention 
to the "Wall of 30."</font>

28
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But based on my experience, 
it was nothing so ambiguous.</font>

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Place the right foot forward, then the left.</i></font>

48
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,120

49
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,730
