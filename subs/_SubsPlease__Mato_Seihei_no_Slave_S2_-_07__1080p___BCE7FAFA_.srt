<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So high!</font>

141
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For the last part,
consolidate your power into your arms.</font>

142
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's insanely strong!</font>

143
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If we leverage your body's flexibility,
it becomes a versatile tool.</font>

144
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ugh, I'm exhaused.</font>

145
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I could really go
for something sweet right now.</font>

146
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay.</font>

147
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I guess we're doing this.</font>

148
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I wondered why my body led me
straight to the kitchen.</font>

149
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So this is your reward.
You're all worn out, aren't you?</font>

150
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,330
<font size="40" color="#ff80c0"><b>{\an7}Mwah!</b></font>

151
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Be grateful I'm feeding you!</font>

152
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come here.</font>

153
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's your reward...</font>

154
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">so there's no need to hold back.</font>

155
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Besides, if I don't do it,
the reward won't end!</font>

156
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your training is going to become
more grueling from here on out.</font>

157
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Drop by the Azuma house
every now and then.</font>

158
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll help you relieve some tension.</font>

159
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, come on! It's still going?!</font>

160
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's the spirit, Himari!</font>

161
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How indecent can you get?!</font>

162
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now, Himari.</font>

163
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Where's your sense of compassion?</font>

164
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Kawabata,</font>

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">you have a magazine interview and
photoshoot on your schedule tomorrow.</font>

166
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll send you the details again.</font>

167
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">'Kay. Thanks a bunch.</font>

168
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,710
<font size="40" color="#00ffff"><b>{\an7}Shiki Kawabata</b></font>

171
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I wonder what they'll ask
at the interview.</font>

172
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My goodness, you're stunning!</font>

173
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You passed the first round
of prey auditions!</font>

174
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoopsies!</font>

175
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Big Sis Shikoku would say
that making a scene is a big no-no!</font>

176
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The summer season has arrived!</font>

177
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Arrived?</font>

178
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Summer's nearly over.</font>

179
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Non, non!</font>

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My summer starts right now!</font>

181
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's not often we get time off.</font>

182
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's kick back
and enjoy a day in the normal world.</font>

183
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Too bad Himari couldn't join us.</font>

184
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, we can't afford
to leave the dorm empty.</font>

185
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And you...</font>

186
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You haven't forgotten
which squad you're in, have you?</font>

187
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm merely stopping by on my break.</font>

188
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I finished the floatie!</font>

189
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right!</font>

190
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's go swim, Nei!</font>

191
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay!</font>

192
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They've got perfect figures!</font>

193
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I saw Commander Ezo that one time.</font>

194
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She was gorgeous, too.</font>

195
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's get out there with them, Yukki!</font>

196
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">S-sure!</font>

197
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The commanders have me beat
in combat power,</font>

198
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but I'll make up for it with skill
and a proactive attitude!</font>

199
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No backing down!</font>

200
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, it's time I get back to work.</font>

201
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay. Good luck out there!</font>

202
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That was fun!</font>

203
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't wait to get Big Sis back to normal
so we can have a blast like we did today.</font>

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Guess who!</font>

205
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shushu?</font>

206
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ya knew it was me right away, huh?</font>

207
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's the matter?</font>

208
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now to hit him with my new technique!</font>

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Selective Paradigm Shift!</font>

210
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Only my boobs get bigger!</font>

211
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I was waiting for the shower...</font>

212
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but you were taking too long.</font>

213
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">S-sorry for making you wait!</font>

214
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's all yours!</font>

215
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's working!
The vacation's loosening him up!</font>

216
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Summer magic is incredible!</font>

217
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I came up with a whole bunch of
romantic plans in preparation for today!</font>

218
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I won't let him escape!</font>

219
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Great view, huh?</font>

220
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shushu.</font>

221
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Everything in Mato looks the same,
so it hits even harder.</font>

222
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So true!</font>

223
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Y'know, us two watching
the sunset like this...</font>

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's like we're a couple.</font>

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your collection of romance manga
in your room got bigger.</font>

226
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Been reading too much?</font>

227
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh? You noticed that?</font>

228
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You mentioned before that you
weren't really into romance manga.</font>

229
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, well...</font>

230
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Guess you could say I'm at that age!</font>

231
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That makes sense.</font>

232
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It does?</font>

233
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You've gotten even cuter lately, Shushu.</font>

234
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oops, time's up.</font>

235
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'd better head to practice.</font>

236
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All my plans went down the drain!</font>

237
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All my plans went down the drain!</font>

238
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yukki!</font>

239
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I get the feeling
this has happened before!</font>

240
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yukki! You dangerous, dangerous man!</font>

241
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I gotta get stronger...</font>

242
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">at my ability and at playing mind games!</font>

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right, let's start our session.</font>

244
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Kyouka, let's practice Heavenward!</font>

245
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Heavenward, huh?</font>

246
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That form is less efficient
and takes too much of a toll on you.</font>

247
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Think of it as a last resort.</font>

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This form is your baseline.</font>

249
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But-</font>

250
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The way I see it...</font>

251
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Heavenward didn't lose to Fubuki
because you lack experience with it.</font>

252
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's too powerful, and you
couldn't control it on your own.</font>

253
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh...</font>

254
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Which is why you'll be able move
effortlessly with more training,</font>

255
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">even in Heavenward form.</font>

256
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Got it!</font>

257
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For now, I want to practice
different kinds of long-range attacks.</font>

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Long-range?</font>

259
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">One of the Eight Thunder Gods had wings.</font>

260
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We should anticipate
our enemy being able to fly.</font>

261
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah.</font>

262
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All I can do right now
is throw rocks at them.</font>

263
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have an idea. We'll test it out.</font>

264
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">First, we get warmed up!</font>

265
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, ma'am!</font>

266
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Were you always this fast
in your normal form?</font>

267
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I got faster 'cause of training!</font>

268
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, it seems like more than that.</font>

269
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've been transforming
into my Whirlwind form a lot lately,</font>

270
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">so my body feels lighter for some reason.</font>

271
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait a minute...</font>

272
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whirlwind.</font>

273
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shining Star.</font>

274
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Iwatooshi.</font>

275
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Phoenix Wings.</font>

276
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Killer Fang.</font>

277
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Human Bullet.</font>

278
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The more I loan him to the others,
the stronger his normal Slave form gets?!</font>

279
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My normal Slave form
gets stronger when you lend me out?</font>

280
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,540
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Reward in</b></font>

281
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,540
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Progress</b></font>

282
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Exactly.</font>

283
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your muscles are retaining the benefits
of the various forms</font>

284
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">you take on with the others.</font>

285
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Which makes it
an even more valuable approach.</font>

286
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That being said, if you're against it-</font>

287
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In that case...</font>

288
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">it might be a good idea to loan me
to the others more often!</font>

289
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah, probably.</font>

290
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Kyouka-</font>

291
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I didn't mean to cut her off like that.</font>

292
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I wonder what she was going to say.</font>

293
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In retrospect...</font>

294
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">it was the same
when she slayed the Unihorn.</font>

295
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">During important battles,</font>

296
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Kyouka always uses this katana
to attack the enemy herself.</font>

297
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're one hundred percent
dedicated to your master.</font>

298
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I ought to be more like you!</font>

299
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And if that means
working with the others...</font>

300
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's do this!</font>

301
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now then...</font>

302
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Today, we'll be taking turns
riding Yuuki Wakura.</font>

303
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What?!</font>

304
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki Wakura, lie down over there.</font>

305
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, ma'am!</font>

306
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, here I go...</font>

307
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Flex your abs.</font>

308
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">L-like this?</font>

309
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yay!</font>

310
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It doesn't hurt
when I sit like this, right?</font>

311
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just relax.</font>

312
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll teach you a lesson, Yuuki Wakura.</font>

313
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw c'mon, don't be a lazy bum!</font>

314
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's it, well done.</font>

315
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Um, am I too heavy?</font>

316
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Am I doing this right?</font>

317
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, are you listening to Miss Yakumo?</font>

318
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are you okay? I'm sorry!</font>

319
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hm, how's this, Yuuki?</font>

320
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What a horrible dream...</font>

321
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why?</font>

322
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's with this awful ache in my chest?</font>

323
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki?</font>

324
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Kyouka!</font>

325
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Perfect timing!</font>

326
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For what?</font>

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">About the whole "lending me out" thing...</font>

328
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I...</font>

329
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">changed my mind!</font>

330
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Emergencies are a different story,
but I don't want our baseline to change!</font>

331
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I want to keep working with you!</font>

332
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Earlier, I...</font>

333
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I thought I had no choice
if I wanted to get stronger.</font>

334
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But it bothered me...</font>

335
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Patrols or battles or whatever else,
I want to do it with you!</font>

336
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The reason my life
looks the way it does is because of you!</font>

337
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Besides, there's barely even a difference
after one of the others borrows me!</font>

338
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I didn't notice until you said something!</font>

339
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki...</font>

340
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But more importantly, my training sessions
with you are usually way more-</font>

341
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

342
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's about time!</font>

343
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's exactly why you're my slave!</font>

344
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah!</font>

345
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right, let's get training!</font>

346
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">To come up with a new technique!</font>

347
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">These chains exist as part of my ability.</font>

348
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I should be able to extend them
now that I'm more familiar with Yuuki.</font>

349
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's make it happen.</font>

350
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Got it!</font>

351
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yuuki!</font>

352
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay!</font>

353
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This light...</font>

354
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That could come in handy
for all sorts of things.</font>

355
00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:01,920
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Reward in</b></font>

356
00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:01,920
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Progress</b></font>

357
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You did a fantastic job tonight, Yuuki.</font>

358
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We have more options in combat now.</font>

359
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll keep up the good work!</font>

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Was that a conch?!</font>

361
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I think one blow means
there's an emergency of some sort.</font>

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Three blows?!</font>

363
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That signal...</font>

364
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Eight Thunder Gods!</font>

365
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Store this one, too.</font>

366
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just a few more 'til we hit our goal!</font>

367
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And boy, am I starving...</font>

368
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Love beam!</font>

369
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Wanna know and wanna do, wanna touch</font>

370
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">These feelings pouring out of me just won't stop</font>

371
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Sweet, so sweet, let me in with your body darling</font>

372
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">I'll domesticate you, time for a reward</font>

373
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">With the heat from skin on skin overlapping</font>

374
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">It's fully charged</font>

375
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Now ready to launch!</font>

376
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Shoot from my hand now, love love beam</font>

377
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Aim for your heart now, love love beam</font>

378
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Bridging the gap between us</font>

379
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">And firing from point blank</font>

380
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!</font>

381
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">You won't escape my love love beam</font>

382
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">To the ends of the Earth, love love beam</font>

383
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Yeah, love is what changes the world</font>

384
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Dye it all heart-colored, even the darkness</font>

385
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="69">The Commander of the 2nd Squadron</font>

386

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw, our Himarin's grown up so much,
hasn't she?</font>

390
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Nei will do her best, too!</font>

391
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">At what?</font>
