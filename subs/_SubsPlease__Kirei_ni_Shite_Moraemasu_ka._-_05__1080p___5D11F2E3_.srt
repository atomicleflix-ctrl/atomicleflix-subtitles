<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gah! What the hell happened?</font>

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eww. They're covered in moldy stains!</font>

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could this happen?</font>

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be because of 
that leak in the ceiling.</font>

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh crap.</font>

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just throw them all 
in the washing machine and—</font>

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, don't do that!</font>

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't clean the stains 
and mold before washing,</font>

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you'll ever get them out.</font>

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what can we do?</font>

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll treat the stains 
and then wash them all myself!</font>

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you make it in time?</font>

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,150

isn't cutting it.</font>

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mold is composed mostly of 
organic ingredients,</font>

36
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I apply a neutral detergent at 
13% concentration directly to the mold</font>

37
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then spray it out.</font>

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But after that, 
there's still some discoloration,</font>

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I have to oxygen-bleach that out 
and try all sorts of treatments.</font>

40
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jeez. And you have 
to do them all one by one?</font>

41
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, the stains are different 
for each one.</font>

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to keep that in consideration when 
deciding how much detergent to apply.</font>

45
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,020

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very impressive!</font>

218
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,540

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you mumbling about anyway?</font>

224
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to get on the float?</font>

225
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

226
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Is that all right?</font>

227
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With a mask on, nobody will know it's you. 
Should be no problem at all.</font>

230
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,170

231
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, all right!</font>

232
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'd better put the mask on first.</font>

233
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

234
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch out!</font>

235
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,390

236
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you tell her to climb on?</font>

237
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you know how dangerous that is?</font>

238
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

239
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really okay, Kyu?</font>

240
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

241
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness.</font>

242
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you aren't injured?</font>

243
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm all right.</font>

244
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I am a little embarrassed 
for causing such a fuss.</font>

245
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry, Kinme-san.</font>

246
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no. It was my fault too.</font>

247
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, I'm really not hurt at all, so...</font>

248
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyusho-kun risked his neck to catch you.</font>

249
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just what were you thinking?</font>

250
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said I'm sorry.</font>

251
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kinme-san's never done this before.</font>

252
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got to keep an eye on her!</font>
