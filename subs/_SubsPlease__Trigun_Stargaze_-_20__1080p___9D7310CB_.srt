00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The child lives under constant
violence and fear.</font>

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Let me go.</font>

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Through his endless suffering 
and despair, he finds an escape.</font>

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He creates a completely 
new person inside himself.</font>

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I'm scared, Nico.</font>

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He then begins believing
 that the one being subjected</font>

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to such a horrible situation is not him,</font>

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but rather this other poor person.</font>

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to... catch up.</font>

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is the "other person"?</font>

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what's up with this treatment?</font>

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought the Eye of Michael 
was supposed to be a friendlier place!</font>

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you feel, Livio?</font>

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Livio? Who's that?</font>

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm...</font>

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Razlo!</font>

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Razlo!</font>

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death!</font>

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who did this to you?!</font>

20
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it Chapel?! 
Or was it the blue-haired freak?!</font>

21
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Livio...</font>

22
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eliminate the traitor!</font>

23
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wolfwood...</font>

24
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Needle-noggin!</font>

25
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wolfwood...</font>

26
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad your brother is alive.</font>

27
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's not my real brother.</font>

28
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's <i>like</i> my little brother.</font>

29
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Needle-noggin...</font>

30
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having family point a gun at you</font>

31
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is pretty bone-chilling, isn't it?</font>

32
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that crybaby Livio who was 
always following in my shadow...</font>

33
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even still alive?</font>

34
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Needle-noggin!</font>

35
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I can't believe them!</font>

36
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aunt Melanie...</font>

37
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going to happen to us?</font>

38
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's all this? We're fine. 
Even without plants...</font>

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, we'll be just fine for a while!</font>

40
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right?</font>

41
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's the rest of the town?</font>

42
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They abandoned the place 
to run off to Octovern</font>

43
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">seeking shelter from that so-called "Ark."</font>

44
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They took all the plants from 
Hopeland to pay for protection.</font>

45
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

46
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're...</font>

47
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? What's going on?</font>

48
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you stopping? Come on!</font>

49
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no. Hey, back up! Go back!</font>

50
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I wasted my time.</font>

51
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, are you Ni—</font>

52
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In fact, I brought this on you. I'm sorry.</font>

53
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

54
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need a favor.</font>

55
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you take care of him?</font>

56
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He needs to rest.</font>

57
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

58
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all I've got. 
Share with everyone, okay?</font>

59
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

60
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I get taken out...</font>

61
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hand Needle-noggin over to the man.</font>

62
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll leave you alone that way.</font>

63
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeehaw!</font>

64
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard you were a merciless,
cold-blooded executioner.</font>

65
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Far from the truth, isn't it?</font>

66
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I see.</font>

67
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was Vash the Stampede.</font>

68
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He must have gotten into
 your head and dragged you down.</font>

69
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's not what this is.</font>

70
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wrong!</font>

71
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

72
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guy's a real idiot in my opinion.</font>

73
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way I could 
ever play along with him.</font>

74
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know... he's an idiot.</font>

75
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything he says is just the 
reality-denying prattle of a spoiled brat.</font>

76
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know all that. But still...</font>

77
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even so...</font>

78
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He never makes any excuses!</font>

79
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

80
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This medicine can cure any wound.</font>

81
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, in return, it causes 
your body to mature rapidly.</font>

82
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Within a few short years, your cells will
 deteriorate, and you will die of old age.</font>

83
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, well. I'm actually surprised 
that you're still up to the task.</font>

84
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But by my calculation, 
this time, you're gonna die.</font>

85
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, what's the point? 
The world is ending soon.</font>

86
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or... do you think Vash the Stampede 
can beat Knives?</font>

87
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows?</font>

88
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if anyone can, it'd be him.</font>

89
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That relentless sincerity of his...</font>

90
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That, I put my faith in.</font>

91
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be afraid of someone 
who never gives up anything.</font>

92
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, how funny.</font>

93
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see if you're right,</font>

94
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if I should be afraid...</font>

95
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">after I'm done with you!</font>

96
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm beating you down.</font>

97
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this!</font>

98
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Die already.</font>

99
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop that!</font>

100
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you talking to me?</font>

101
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you, Livio.</font>

102
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why does everyone always call me Livio?</font>

103
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you <i>are</i> Livio.</font>

104
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you remember how 
Nicholas took care of you?</font>

105
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicholas, you're a fool yourself.</font>

106
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tried to do everything all 
by your lonesome again, didn't you?</font>

107
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear, you always take the losing side.</font>

108
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have such high standards 
and never compromise.</font>

109
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why you get hurt so often.</font>

110
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being alone must be so overwhelming.</font>

111
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all beat up, and you've 
been gone for so many years.</font>

112
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:18,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet you come back when we need you most.</font>

113
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, maybe I tried to take on
 too much by myself.</font>

114
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I screwed up.</font>

115
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't move anymore.</font>

116
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't save Livio.</font>

117
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't show everyone the hope 
that leads to tomorrow.</font>

118
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang on. This ain't right.</font>

119
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shouldn't be remembering 
his face at a time like this.</font>

120
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I see now.</font>

121
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I finally get it.</font>

122
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you, Nicholas D. Wolfwood?</font>

123
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The reason I couldn't stop
 looking for him.</font>

124
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The reason I keep going after him.</font>

125
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's my...</font>

126
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really get what's going on,</font>

127
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but killing them first seems like fun.</font>

128
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't... you...</font>

129
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take everything from you 
before I kill you!</font>

130
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Auntie...</i></font>

131
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I have a friend now.</i></font>

132
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I'm Nicholas's friend.</font>

133
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Needle-noggin... If you can move,
you shoulda gotten here sooner.</font>

134
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, sorry.</font>

135
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys go back up.</font>

136
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry!</font>

137
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Auntie, you guys said "Nicholas"!</font>

138
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was that Nico?!</font>

139
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, everyone. That man is...</font>

140
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He stopped every single 
shot out of my Tri-Punisher?</font>

141
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, wow. I'm getting hard.</font>

142
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's awesome! So awesome!</font>

143
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll dedicate your heads 
to the late Master Chapel!</font>

144
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem a lot more interesting 
than this guy at my feet.</font>

145
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know about that.</font>

146
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still playing with me.</font>

147
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're practically dead. What do you want?</font>

148
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get lost!</font>

149
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Useless.</font>

150
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't even hurt— Huh?</font>

151
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My blood?!</font>

152
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're using it as the medicine!</font>

153
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going for the heart.</font>

154
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it, Razlo.</font>

155
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow...</font>

156
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My regeneration can't keep up.</i></font>

157
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait... What?</font>

158
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>

159
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crybaby Livio!</font>

160
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna save you!</font>

161
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

162
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's over. Stop, Razlo.</font>

163
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I see. Are you Livio?</font>

164
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do you think you're talking to?!</font>

165
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounded like an order!</font>

166
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, then let me put it this way.</font>

167
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm ending you now...</font>

168
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death!</font>

169
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Stop, you idiot!</font>

170
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Without me, you're just a—</font>

171
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Truly. I forced 
everything painful onto you.</font>

172
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's fine now.</font>

173
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can go on.</font>

174
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I want to live like him.</font>

175
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I'll catch up one day.</font>

176
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is farewell.</font>

177
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodbye, Razlo, my friend!</font>

178
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mister... Wolfwood.</font>

179
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

180
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back, crybaby Livio.</font>

181
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay with us, Wolfwood!</font>

182
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicholas!</font>

183
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't die. My blood should
 fix you up right away!</font>

184
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still the same old crybaby.</font>

185
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll never catch up to me like that.</font>

186
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nico! You're Nico, aren't you?</font>

187
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you use the toilet by yourself now?</font>

188
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I can!</font>

189
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all grown up now.</font>

190
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Needle-noggin...</font>

191
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care of everyone.</font>

192
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nico!</font>

193
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I'm home.</font>

194
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wolfwood?</font>

195
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicholas!</font>

196
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Nico!</font>

197
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Nico...</font>

198
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Open your eyes! Don't die! Nico!</font>

199
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Nico!</font>

200
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say something!</font>

201
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're disturbing my rest.</font>

202
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Wolfwood!</font>

203
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Nico! Are you okay?!</font>

204
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nicholas!</font>

205
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness.</font>

206
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wolfwood!</font>

207
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said you're disturbing my rest!</font>

208
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>

209
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must go and finish 
our fight against Knives.</font>
