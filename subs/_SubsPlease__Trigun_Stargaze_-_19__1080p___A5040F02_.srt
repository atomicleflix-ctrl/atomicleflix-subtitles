<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, auntie. This is it.</font>

00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay healthy! Be careful with the water.</font>

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good luck! Good luck!</font>

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is your home. 
Come back anytime, Nicholas.</font>

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come back anytime, Nico!</font>

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll welcome you just like this
 when you return!</font>

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm off.</font>

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The town of Red Valley Bottom...</font>

14
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We suspect it was attacked by the Ark 
several weeks to months ago</font>

15
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and robbed of its plant.</font>

16
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Ark continues around the world,</font>

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,220

18
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With all our satellites down,</font>

19
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we have no means of 
long-range communication.</font>

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The intermittent flow of 
information further instills fear,</font>

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">sowing panic far and wide.</font>

22
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The goal of Millions Knives</font>

23
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is to liberate the plants from their 
oppression under humans,</font>

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">grant them freedom, 
and create a paradise for plants.</font>

25
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world of humans is quietly drying up.</font>

26
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there nothing we can do but wait

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if the boss is doing okay.</font>

29
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granted, we don't even know if the 
Bernardelli News Agency is still around.</font>

30
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of, our salaries...</font>

31
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one's receiving my reports either.</font>

32
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Milly, remember that we're journalists.</font>

33
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's keep documenting!</font>

34
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The future ahead needs 
to know what happened.</font>

35
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll do the legwork ourselves,
and record everything we see and hear!</font>

36
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it, Meryl!</font>

37
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need to photograph me.</font>

38
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we're recording <i>everything</i>, right?</font>

39
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait...</font>

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, pose!</font>

41
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed you've
 been able to withstand</font>

42
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the crushing force of
 Legato's power for so long.</font>

43
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still don't feel like joining me, Vash?</font>

44
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is nothing compared to the pain 
I've endured over the last 150 years.</font>

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, it's been 150 years.</font>

46
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Far too long.</font>

47
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to you, we've wasted so much time.</font>

48
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Many more of our brethren
 were squeezed dry, devoured.</font>

49
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wouldn't know about that.</font>

50
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've seen my share of dead plants.</font>

51
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All gone black.</font>

52
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The black represents fatigue.</font>

53
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because they pushed 
their powers to the limit.</font>

54
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The same will happen to us, 
sooner or later.</font>

55
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you knew.</font>

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what else can humans do 
to survive on this desert planet?</font>

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their only recourse
 is to rely on us plants.</font>

58
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And plants can't survive
 without tending by humans.</font>

59
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd live much longer 
out from under their thumb.</font>

60
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't forget, Nai!</font>

61
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The people on this planet are forced 
to live a parched life of struggle.</font>

62
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our kind are put in a situation where 
we must push ourselves to fatigue.</font>

63
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And why is that? 
It all started with the Big Fall!</font>

64
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nai...</font>

65
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really think people 
are incapable of change?</font>

66
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It takes time, and they can
 move backward too,</font>

67
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but surely they can move forward.</font>

68
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least, Rem was like that!</font>

69
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The time it takes is exactly the problem.</font>

70
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the while, our brethren are being
 abused, bled dry, and disposed of.</font>

71
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then <i>that's</i> the part we need to fix!</font>

72
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody pays heed to the words of cattle.</font>

73
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Vash.</font>

74
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you forgotten Tesla?</font>

75
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't forgotten. Not for a moment.</font>

76
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was the day that drove us all mad!</font>

77
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the thing, though!</font>

78
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The true nature of violence can only 
be named by those who have felt it!</font>

79
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only those who've experienced pain can
 truly speak the words to stop conflict!</font>

80
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tesla... Tesla's death...</font>

81
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to make that just another part
of the cycle of hatred and strife?</font>

82
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or will you make it the foundation 
you build your conviction upon?</font>

83
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the real struggle!</font>

84
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you turn away, Nai!</font>

85
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. You're completely right, Vash.</font>

86
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The pain was unbearable.</font>

87
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet through it, I learned the truth.</font>

88
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so right!</font>

89
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And they too must learn. 
Then we'll finally be even!</font>

90
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nai...</font>

91
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you before. This is the battle 
to bring everything back to even, Vash!</font>

92
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't repeat the same mistake!</font>

93
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The end of the world of humans...</font>

94
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The birth of paradise for our brethren...</font>

95
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bear witness from there.</font>

96
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, Nai!</font>

97
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, forget about Rem already.</font>

98
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That memory will only hurt you.</font>

99
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meryl, I'm thirsty.</font>

100
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talking only makes it worse.</font>

101
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Oh, I should have listened
to my senior coworker"</font>

102
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"and used my water more conservatively!"</font>

103
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't narrate my thoughts.</font>

104
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been together nearly a year.</font>

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can read your mind to the letter.</font>

106
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So be it. I'll share my water—</font>

107
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm out.</font>

108
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You drank all of yours, too!</font>

109
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I did. It's so hot out.</font>

110
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh, water!</font>

111
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If only we had some Worms.</font>

112
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd squeeze their bodily fluids
 out for a drink!</font>

113
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would not!</font>

114
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If only there were some Worms around, 
my big sister could come find me.</font>

115
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What nonsense are you talking now?</font>

116
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Meryl, look!</font>

117
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough about Worms.</font>

118
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not that!</font>

119
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meryl! Milly!</font>

120
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you're both safe!</font>

121
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for coming to pick us up. 
How did you find us?</font>

122
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got close enough for us 
to catch your tracker signal.</font>

123
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, how about Vash?</font>

124
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I hope he's okay.</font>

125
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure he is.</font>

126
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

127
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the water! 
Is everyone back at Home doing well?</font>

128
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bet! Everyone's good.</font>

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two came back at just the right time.</font>

130
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did?</font>

131
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is "do," and this is "mi."</font>

132
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So which note is this?</font>

133
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's "so"! No, it's "re"! 
Oh, I don't know.</font>

134
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice guess. This one's "ti."</font>

135
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, let's all start with "do" 
and review in order.</font>

136
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One, two...</font>

137
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do!</font>

138
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, do a puppet show!</font>

139
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Emilio the Puppetmaster!</font>

140
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always complain no matter 
the I show I put on, so no!</font>

141
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, do it!</font>

142
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on!</font>

143
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. This is a special exception.</font>

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

145
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mwahaha! I am the king 
who rules the world!</font>

146
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bow before me, foolish peasants!</font>

147
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do something else.</font>

148
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not fun.</font>

149
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do another show.</font>

150
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it. I'm done.</font>

151
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

152
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luida.</font>

153
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we ready?</font>

154
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good to go!</font>

155
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. Begin.</font>

156
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

157
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't just hanging out 
for the past five months.</font>

158
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be ready to fly again soon.</font>

159
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'll stop the Ark, once and for all.</font>

160
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Altitude control success.</font>

161
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Internals, externals, 
and engines all clear.</font>

162
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must've had a hard trip.</font>

163
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back.</font>

164
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, it's good to be back!</font>

165
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plant robberies by the invading Ark</font>

166
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">have more or less destroyed this region.</font>

167
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The surviving citizens have been 
migrating here to stay alive:</font>

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The major city of Octovern, 
which hasn't been attacked yet.</font>

169
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In its vicinity...</font>

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

171
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not that one!</font>

172
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milly...</font>

173
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

174
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Not this one... Or this one either.</font>

175
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, here we go!</font>

176
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basically, the entire planet's 
population is gathering</font>

177
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in the 50-kilometer area
 surrounding Octovern.</font>

178
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Its extant plants are 
operating at full power,</font>

179
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">supplying just enough food 
to stave off starvation.</font>

180
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The immigrant fleet will arrive soon.</font>

181
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hope is the only thing 
keeping everything together.</font>

182
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This doesn't make a whole lot
of sense to me, though.</font>

183
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said the Sandsteamers going 
to that location are safe too, right?</font>

184
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. We found that to be odd as well.</font>

185
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he trying to gather all the humans 
on this planet in one place?</font>

186
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably.</font>

187
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And eliminate them all in one fell swoop.</font>

188
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

189
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, some information from our side.</font>

190
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't been able to locate 
either the Ark or Vash's tracker.</font>

191
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, regarding the immigrant fleet...</font>

192
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've yet to detect 
or communicate with them.</font>

193
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, we estimated they will arrive
 at Noman's Land within a month.</font>

194
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One more month!</font>

195
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's so soon!</font>

196
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I doubt that Knives will 
sit idly by as they arrive.</font>

197
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know exactly what he has planned,</font>

198
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the Ark will certainly descend upon 
the area around Octovern soon.</font>

199
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must do two things when the time comes.</font>

200
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rescue Vash and take down the Ark!</font>

201
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

202
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Is killing Knives really the right thing,
even if it's to save the planet?"</font>

203
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Can we truly stand for sacrificing
 the few in order to save the many?"</font>

204
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"At least, Vash would..."</font>

205
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't narrate my thoughts.</font>

206
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been together nearly a year.</font>

207
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can read your mind to the letter!</font>

208
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly...</font>

209
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think Vash would say 
he'll protect everything.</font>

210
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if there is no answer there.</font>

211
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you looking for 
the metabolism enhancers?</font>

212
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If so, they're in that box there.</font>

213
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, no need.</font>

214
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you not to push yourself too hard.</font>

215
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not.</font>

216
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just don't rely on anyone. That's all.</font>

217
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

218
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like your plant haul is going well</font>

219
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

220
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did he call it?</font>

221
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Genesis Flood Big Fall?</font>

222
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he pulls this off, 
every human here dies,</font>

223
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">both on this planet and in the fleet.</font>

224
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you're okay with that, Doc?</font>

225
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to create a new race of humans 
who could survive on this planet.</font>

226
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ones who could live without the help of plants.</font>

227
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that already.</font>

228
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm who you're talking about.</font>

229
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am sorry.</font>

230
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could have stayed young if not for me.</font>

231
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this is our last chance.</font>

232
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

233
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Survival is the highest 
priority for all life.</font>

234
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And evolution occurs rapidly 
when facing the danger of extinction.</font>

235
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The great calamity Knives causes...</font>

236
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If even a handful of humans 
can survive it,</font>

237
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">perhaps a new breed of humanity that can 
coexist with the Independents will arise.</font>

238
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I myself will probably never see it,</font>

239
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I can't wait.</font>

240
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just like the rest of 'em.
 Completely off your rocker.</font>

241
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you know?</font>

242
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everybody in this world is crazy.</font>

243
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me included, and naturally, you too.</font>

244
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The promised moment draws near.</font>

245
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must confess... 
Back then, I was too hasty.</font>

246
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This time, I won't make the same mistake.</font>

247
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will rescue every last one of 
our brethren on the immigrant fleet.</font>

248
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am not afraid. This is rage.</font>

249
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The humans...</font>

250
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They act with no control based 
on their individual whims.</font>

251
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They care not for others,</font>

252
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and by that nature, they have abused us.
They are trying to devour us.</font>

253
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lend me your aid.</font>

254
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need more strength.</font>

255
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Strength!</font>

256
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doctor, can you hear me?</font>

257
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yes.</i></font>

258
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prepare for the next grafting. 
This time, I'll take twenty.</font>

259
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will take a while.</font>

260
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't care. Do it.</i></font>

261
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is for my brethren.</i></font>

262
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then let us begin. Connecting.</font>

263
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My kin, give me strength.</i></font>

264
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Doctor...</font>

265
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

266
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Knives is always talking about
his brethren this, brethren that, but...</font>

267
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what?</font>

268
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, never mind.</font>

269
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the blue-haired freak has his limits 
on no rest or sleep, huh?</font>

270
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's lights-out for you now.</font>

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one-liner will cost you your life.</font>

272
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was only an instant, but—</font>

273
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe in your usual state, sure.</font>

274
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But after five months of concentrating
 nonstop, who knows?</font>

275
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe controlling one person 
is the best you can do!</font>

276
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do it, Needle-noggin!</font>

277
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn you!</font>

278
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're finished.</font>

279
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't do it, Wolfwood.</font>

280
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever the softie.</font>

281
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll escape on one of these.</font>

282
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know how to fly it?</font>

283
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope, but we gotta pull something off.</font>

284
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the Sandsteamer...</font>

285
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You... You're alive?!</font>

286
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the backup.</font>

287
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Livio...</font>

288
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been told that Livio
 the Double Fang is dead.</font>

289
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Killed by you, Nicholas the Punisher!</font>

290
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're</i> Livio! 
What are you talking about?!</font>

291
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one talking nonsense!</font>

292
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

293
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone is seriously out
 of their damn mind.</font>

294
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Razlo!</font>

295
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death!</font>

296
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm home.</font>
