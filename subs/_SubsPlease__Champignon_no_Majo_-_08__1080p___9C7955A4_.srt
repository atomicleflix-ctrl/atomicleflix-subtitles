00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's morning. I've got to eat something.</i></font>

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}SCRAWNY</font>

3
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

4
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like he's lost weight.</font>

5
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, Lize doesn't like 
to eat a whole lot.</font>

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He even pretended to be sick before.</font>

7
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I CANNOT EAT...</font>

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Luna saw right through it.</font>

9
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if he just doesn't 
like Luna's cooking.</font>

10
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be back later!</font>

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}HE WAS ALLOWED TIME TO
 PICK WILD STRAWBERRIES</font>

12
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Lize really say 
he hates your cooking?</font>

13
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}EPISODE 8: WHITE WITCHES 
AND BLACK WITCHES</font>

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, he is royalty, after all. 
He's probably a really picky eater.</font>

15
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But is it really inedible? Twist his arm
 if you have to, just make him eat.</font>

16
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Us black witches don't have 
to eat like humans do anyway,</font>

17
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so we don't really get how that works.</font>

18
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mushroom Lord, thank you for seeing me.</font>

19
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that I think about it, I once 
heard that natural energy eaters</font>

20
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">taste things differently than humans do.</font>

21
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}HAVING NOTICED LUNA AND THE OTHERS WERE
 ACTING STRANGE, LIZE MADE PLANS TO SPEAK 
SECRETLY TO THE CHATTY MUSHROOM AGAIN.</font>

22
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? They do?</font>

23
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Natural energy eaters?</i></font>

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can get by with natural energy alone,</font>

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but since he's closer to human and 
has a white witch's constitution,</font>

26
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it isn't that easy.</font>

27
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mushroom Lord, what does 
"natural energy eater" mean?</font>

28
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, let's see.</font>

29
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Black witches like Luna do not get 
their sustenance by eating food,</font>

30
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but by extracting the magic and life 
force directly from nature itself.</font>

31
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Black witches, with their strong magic,</font>

32
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">always have fresh energy 
flowing through their bodies,</font>

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they do not age the way that humans do.</font>

34
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They never had any need for the kind of 
culinary traditions humans developed.</font>

35
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, Luna is very interested 
in human culture and customs,</font>

36
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so perhaps she was trying to 
copy what she knew of cooking.</font>

37
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps she wanted a taste of what it 
is like to be part of the human world.</font>

38
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, it seems observations and books 
alone were not enough to teach her</font>

39
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">how something should taste.</font>

40
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poor Miss Witch...</font>

41
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You remember that time you said 
you baked a really nice cake</font>

42
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and decided to send it to 
another magician as thanks?</font>

43
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that cake! It was really yummy.</font>

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was for Master Bird and 
I'm the one who took it to him.</font>

45
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He took a bite and said...</font>

46
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this a kind of experimental 
drug or something?</font>

47
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, so you might wanna get 
a human friend to taste your cooking</font>

48
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and get some pointers.</font>

49
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this some kind of pie-shaped medicine?</font>

50
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:45,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}APOTHECARY</font>

51
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I think the usual pills or 
liquids are a lot easier to ingest.</font>

54
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, this tastes nothing 
like food. Mm-hmm.</font>

55
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even pigs wouldn't eat this sort of slop.</font>

58
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. I don't need to eat any.
 I can sense the aura.</font>

61
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But here's a cookbook 
I think you should read.</font>

62
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's why. There's a human child 
that you're trying to cook for.</font>

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you using good ingredients?</font>

64
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I can't get something, 
I leave it out or use a substitute.</font>

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that's all you're doing, it still
 shouldn't turn out this bad.</font>

66
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't sweat it, Luna.</font>

67
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you think of any 
other reason for this?</font>

68
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I use reversal magic to remove 
the poison from the mushrooms,</font>

69
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and sometimes cheat with magic to 
make it look more like the real thing.</font>

70
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explains it.</font>

71
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

72
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, step on up.</font>

73
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like one wheel of cheese and—</font>

74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yikes! It's the poison mushroom 
witch everyone's talking about!</font>

75
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but would you get away? Please 
don't grow any mushrooms on my product!</font>

76
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah! Get away from my shop!</font>

77
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're ya gonna do 
if you spoil all my goods?</font>

78
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay away from me!</font>

79
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up and get out of our town!</font>

80
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this? You want us 
to sell you vegetables?</font>

82
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That puts us in a real spot.</font>

84
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If folks found out I sold ya all 
that milk, I'd be in real hot water.</font>

85
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but I gotta charge ya 
double market price or no deal.</font>

86
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, let's see. I guess I could sell 
some for three times market price.</font>

87
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My boy.</font>

88
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My boy?</font>

89
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your sadness is turning into 
blight and starting to overflow.</font>

90
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do I really have to write about 
this feeling in my diary?</font>

91
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I write it down, 
it'll be like I never felt it.</font>

92
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go back to not knowing anything 
about how Miss Witch feels.</font>

93
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know the blight I collect creates 
a lot of problems for everyone,</font>

94
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the thought of living on 
with no memory of her pain</font>

95
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">scares me even more.</font>

96
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there any way I can 
hang on to this feeling?</font>

97
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As far as I'm concerned, 
even if I'm corrupted,</font>

98
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this pain is a very valuable, 
even irreplaceable feeling.</font>

99

feeling is poisonous,</font>

100
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to let go of it.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna, Lize just got home!</font>

102
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back.</font>

103
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you pick a bunch of 
raspberries and stuff?</font>

104
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, no, not really.</font>

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, you're such a goof, Lize.</font>

106
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't do anything without me, can you?
 Next time I'll go with and help.</font>

107
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dinner is ready. Take a seat.</font>

108
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

109
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It smells good!</font>

110
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks good!</font>

111
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a turnip and milk soup. With bread.</font>

112
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I didn't make much, though.</font>

113
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

114
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the food!</font>

115
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is good!</font>

116
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey Lize, I'm the one who found 
the guy selling this milk.</font>

117
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,630

121
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,500

195
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How to use his diary.</font>

196
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't even count!</font>

197
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gravity, healing, and conjuring magic.</font>

198
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but all only barely.</font>

199
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's it?!</font>

200
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Mushroom Lord said that Lize

201
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something about a green—</font>

204
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,220

205
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is not easy to do for most people.</font>

210
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And become a big boy.</font>

213
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno.</font>

214
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why?</i></font>

215
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why is my body so much smaller

216
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's almost like I'm a child and she's

217
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I get the feeling that my body

218
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A feeling that I was supposed to be

219
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to be focused on my

220
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,380

221
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,880

223
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,090

227
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all that training in black magic,</font>

228
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's probably got one-tenth of

230
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have figured it out by now, Luna.</font>

231
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's definitely descended 
from white witches.</font>

232
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it sounds like they've got their

233
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's gonna have to figure 
out what that is by himself.</font>

234
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But for us black witches, that's

238
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you hear us?</font>

239
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His magical powers are starting to grow.</font>

240
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're right over here. Look down.</font>

241
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we're behind you.</font>

242
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He finally noticed us!</font>

246
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,310

247
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well gosh, you didn't 
notice us all this time.</font>

248
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He still looks adorable

249
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good afternoon, Lize. 
I'm the bean spirit you created.</font>

250
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,660

253
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am a thistle spirit.</font>

254
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, thank you for taking 
such good care of us.</font>

255
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,710

257
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This child's seeds are more 
magical than they should be</font>

258
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it's got the green 
spirits all in a tizzy.</font>

259
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh be quiet, water spirit. 
Don't be so annoying all the time.</font>

260
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What is happening?</i></font>

261
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello, Lize. I'm a wind spirit. 
You don't understand any of this, do you?</font>

262
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White witches are essentially "charms."</font>

263
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, your charm allows you 
to borrow power from demons and spirits.</font>

264
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Charm?</font>

265
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White witches' magic and longevity 
largely draw from those energies.</font>

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? So the black witches and 
white witches are totally different.</font>

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">White witches' powers may seem trivial,</font>

268
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but their charm power is actually 
a weak point for the black witches.</font>

269
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh dear. Kinopio is upset. 
Perhaps we said too much.</font>

270
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Lize, you should polish 
your charm abilities</font>

271
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and use that power to entertain us.</font>

272
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you do, then we can help you out. 
That's how white witch powers work.</font>

273
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I still don't know 
what this is all about.</font>

274
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, but you're already starting to see.</font>

275
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sing us a song, Lize.</font>

276
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A song? I've never sung before. 
I can't even think of one.</font>

277
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it. Just take your feelings 
and put them to any melody you imagine.</font>

278
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is your white witch training.</font>

279
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Training?</i></font>

280
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go for it, Lize.</font>

281
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell is that singing? Is it him?</font>

282
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is definitely spirit language.</font>

283
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mushroom Lord!</font>

284
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He probably carries the 
language inside his cells.</font>

285
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand what it 
means, Luna and Claude?</font>

286
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How would I know? I can 
more or less guess, though.</font>

287
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand, Mushroom Lord?</font>

288
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I certainly do.</font>

289
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, when you fall in love one day,</font>

290
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">song will become your solace, 
your strength, and your guide.</font>

291
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Whose voice is that?</i></font>

292
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The power of love is what 
awakens the white witch's charm</i></font>

293
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and amplifies it.</i></font>

294
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wonderful! You're great, Lize!</font>

295
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How cute! I can totally get behind that!</font>

296
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, I offer you the 
blessing of the trees.</font>

297
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we present you with 
the protection of water.</font>

298
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,740

299
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you get it now, Lize?</font>

300
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Polishing your charm 
with the power of love</font>

301
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the key to white witch magic training.</font>

302
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are a lot of different 
kinds of white witches,</font>

303
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but your singing is especially lovely!</font>

304
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love may be poison for black witches,</font>

305
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it is a source of 
power for white witches.</font>

306
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What? Poison?</i></font>

307
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sing once again, Lize. Sing so 
that even the sky blesses you.</font>

308
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that even rainbows appear!</font>

309
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In that moment, I still 
didn't understand anything.</i></font>

310
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like that gut feeling 
I had was spot on.</font>

311
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes me sick,</font>

312
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if it gets the job done, I'm not 
gonna complain about how he does it.</font>

313
