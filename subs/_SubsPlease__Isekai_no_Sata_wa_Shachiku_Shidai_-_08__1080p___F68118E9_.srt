00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do whatever you want!</font>

132
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's very devout in his faith,</font>

133
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but his honesty to his own 
emotions is a bit of a problem.</font>

134
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe it's quite normal at that age.</font>

135
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, it would seem he 
never liked me to begin with.</font>

136
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True...</font>

137
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:58,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's always had an inferiority complex 
toward nobles and civil servants.</font>

138
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If they assigned him to me knowing that,</i></font>

139
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the church must feel very strongly
 about the royal palace indeed.</i></font>

140
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of the monks in training, some have no 
families, and the majority are commoners.</font>

141
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They instinctively reject 
anyone from the royal palace.</font>

142
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I could reassign you another guide,</font>

143
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I cannot go against the 
orders of Bishop Mateus.</font>

144
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, please don't worry about it.</font>

145
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The church is open year-round.</i></font>

146
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Their jobs and lives here are intertwined,
so they learn as they work every day.</i></font>

147
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Being raised in such a closed-off
environment from a young age</i></font>

148
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>is bound to instill a biased 
set of values in them.</i></font>

149
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The church can prepare meals for you.</font>

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Many foods disagree with my constitution,</font>

151
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so it's easier to bring my own lunch.</font>

152
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no resistance to magicules
 or magical energy,</font>

153
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I show symptoms of overdose if 
I consume foods containing them in excess.</font>

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Overdose?</font>

155
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, holy magic and recovery spells 
have the opposite effect on me.</font>

156
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though they'd heal injury or illness,</font>

157
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd break out in a fever 
from magic-sickness.</font>

158
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the holy maiden...</font>

159
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suspect she received divine protection,
as she was formally summoned here.</font>

160
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, divine protection... That's true.</font>

161
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that must mean...</font>

162
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are the tribulated disciple.</font>

163
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come again?</font>

164
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your inability to adapt to this world
 must be a trial given to you by God.</font>

165
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I think I just flipped a switch!</i></font>

166
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What an incredible sense of déjà vu!</i></font>

167
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I'm not careful, I might get 
strong-armed into monastic training...</i></font>

168
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just happened to tag along when 
the holy maiden was summoned!</font>

169
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

170
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything God does has meaning.</font>

171
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that right?</font>

172
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ist-san...</font>

173
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ist-san.</font>

174
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Kondou.</font>

175
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've come to get a progress 
report on the return spell.</font>

176
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Kondu! Long time no see.</font>

177
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The otherworlder is amazing.</font>

178
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:24,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER</font>

179
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even we can't understand some 
of the stuff Ist-san says.</font>

180
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are all otherworlders like that?</font>

181
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think something's just wrong with 
him. He's similar to Ist-san...</font>

182
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only do you lack manpower,</font>

183
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you also lack the funds to buy
 tools required for your research.</font>

184
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

185
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to buy them for us?
When? Tomorrow?</font>

186
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't say we'd buy them yet.</font>

187
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be at the church tomorrow, 
so I won't be able come by.</font>

188
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then bring me back one 
of those sacred relics.</font>

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's obviously not happening.</font>

190
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good grief...</font>

191
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kondou-san! It's been a while!</font>

192
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It certainly has.</font>

193
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Likewise, it's been some time, 
Prince Yurius.</font>

194
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wish to see your face.</font>

195
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kondou-san, I heard you wouldn't be 
around because of a temporary assignment.</font>

196
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am indeed on a temporary
 assignment elsewhere.</font>

197
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just back on my day off.</font>

198
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your day off, but you came 
to work in your uniform?</font>

199
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be quite busy...</font>

200
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, your temporary
 assignment must be close</font>

201
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if you can stop by here 
on your day off, right?</font>

202
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm working at the church 
in the royal capital.</font>

203
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? The church?</font>

204
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been visiting the church myself!</font>

205
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

206
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How is your work going there?</font>

207
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been purifying those who feel 
sick and healing the injured.</font>

208
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really happy there's somewhere
 I can be of so much help!</font>

209
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She looks so spirited.</i></font>

210
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She must find it quite rewarding.</i></font>

211
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then there's Selio-kun!</font>

212
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's one of the children training to 
become a monk, and he's so beautiful!</font>

213
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On top of that, he's a very good boy 
and teaches me all kinds of things.</font>

214
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

215
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I've never run into you at the church.</font>

216
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a large facility, and I'm
 mainly doing office work,</font>

217
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I hardly visit the chapel.</font>

218
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that makes sense...</font>

219
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yua.</font>

220
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the holy maiden, 
so there's no need for you to work.</font>

221
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yurius-sama...</font>

222
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I've said many times before,
I want to do what I can.</font>

223
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've told you that
you only need to purify—</font>

224
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I've told you I don't want that!</font>

225
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

226
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait.</font>

227
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with me for a bit.</font>

228
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

229
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why has Yua come to reject me?</font>

230
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why does she depend on someone weak
 and powerless like you instead of me?</font>

231
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Answer me, Kondou!</font>

232
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He pronounced my name correctly.</i></font>

233
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ask me all you'd like,</i></font>

234
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but the answer is obvious if 
you consider what's led to this.</i></font>

235
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps the two of you are drifting 
apart due to a difference in values.</font>

236
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A difference in values?</font>

237
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yua's from a noble family. 
Our ideals cannot be so different.</font>

238
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, the class system was abolished 
in our country and no longer exists.</font>

239
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

240
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even so, Yua is the holy maiden.</font>

241
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She should be treated with great care.</font>

242
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet recently, 
she's begun to spurn even that.</font>

243
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's likely showing restraint.</font>

244
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She probably doesn't want to 
feel she owes him anything.</i></font>

245
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In simple terms, she doesn't 
want others to just serve her.</i></font>

246
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She wants to return to her own world.</i></font>

247
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>However, the kingdom wants her to stay 
as a political and diplomatic symbol.</i></font>

248
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Quite the impasse, 
no matter how you look at it.</i></font>

249
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough. Leave me.</font>

250
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then if you'll excuse me...</font>

251
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Good grief.</i></font>

252
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was planning on doing some 
research in the palace library.</i></font>

253
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to hurry...</i></font>

254
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander Makovska of the second 
royal order. Nice to see you again.</font>

255
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have some time?</font>

256
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm very sorry. I actually have 
something to do after this.</font>

257
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It won't take long.</font>

258
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please just let me work.</i></font>

259
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. There are no longer any 
knights who'd dare lay a hand on you.</font>

260
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what is this about?</font>

261
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's about Prince Yurius...</font>

262
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is there another problem with him?</i></font>

263
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there any way you could mediate 
between His Highness and Her Holiness?</font>

264
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm leaving.</font>

265
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That guy...</font>

266
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wasn't his name Kon...</font>

267
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kon...ou?</font>

268
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about Seiichirou?</font>

269
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh, don't startle me like that.</font>

270
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You startled yourself.</font>

271
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what about Seiichirou?</font>

272
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sei...ichiro?</font>

273
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you just mention his name?</font>

274
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, just now?</font>

275
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, since we just found out 
about the next expedition,</font>

276
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was wondering if Seiichiro
 would be coming along.</font>

277
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He participated in the first
 due to demand from above</font>

278
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and to investigate for the
 miasma containment project,</font>

279
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but someone of his constitution 
should never go near the demon forest.</font>

280
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never let him do it again.</font>

281
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since when did Aresh have the final say?</i></font>

282
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, come to think of it, we finally 
received the documents for the expedition.</font>

283
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you take a look at them?</font>

284
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

285
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one other than myself needs 
to call him Seiichirou.</font>

286
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His family name is Kondou.</font>

287
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call him that.</font>

288
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This goes beyond just being protective.</i></font>

289
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He always puts Kondu first, 
and now they're even living together.</i></font>

290
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no doubt about it.</font>

291
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh's first love is definitely 
Kondu the otherworlder.</font>

292
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The bishop and accountant, 
who are away on business,</i></font>

293
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>should be returning shortly.</i></font>

294
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd like to have all the church 
documents in order before then.</i></font>

295
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The problem is that I'm unfamiliar with
the politics of the Church and nobility.</i></font>

296
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Church...</i></font>

297
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The nobility...</i></font>

298
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Nobles should have family names, 
but the priest didn't give me one.</i></font>

299
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milan-san.</font>

300
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

301
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do nobles who enter the 
Church cut ties with their families?</font>

302
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That depends.</font>

303
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some nobles still receive aid
from their families once they join.</font>

304
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes children from good families</font>

305
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are also entrusted to a church 
temporarily to learn manners.</font>

306
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So not everyone cuts familial 
ties when they enter.</font>

307
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

308
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milord has returned. 
Would you join us in greeting him?</font>

309
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was close!</i></font>

310
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We would have crossed paths 
if I'd come home any later.</i></font>

311
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Either way, he's home awfully early today.</i></font>

312
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Valtom-san has been taking care of 
Aresh-sama since he was a young boy.</i></font>

313
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's practically a father figure and 
the only one who can reason with him.</i></font>

314
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If a man like him is asking me 
to greet Aresh-sama with them,</i></font>

315
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>this must mean...</i></font>

316
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't have the courage to ask,</i></font>

317
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I wonder what the servants 
of this house think of me.</i></font>

318
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome home, Aresh-sama.</font>

319
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you plotting?</font>

320
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How rude. It's the least I can do 
to welcome my landlord home.</font>

321
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of person do you take me for?</font>

322
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An extreme workaholic.</font>

323
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't think I'll be welcoming 
him home anymore.</i></font>

324
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have the documents for the 
next expedition. Want to see?</font>

325
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do!</font>

326
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The purification should be complete
 with the third expedition,</font>

327
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I proposed to have barrier sorcerers
and builders join the expedition</font>

328
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and stand by in a local village, 
but it seems that was rejected.</font>

329
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The completion of the 
purification isn't certain.</font>

330
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll need to confirm things 
after the purification,</font>

331
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and there's already
 a shortage of sorcerers,</font>

332
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm sure they weren't able to gather 
enough to cast the barrier spell.</font>

333
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'll need a separate expedition 
to put up the barrier...</font>

334
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One needs a certain level
 of magical energy</font>

335
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to be appointed as a 
royal sorcerer, right?</font>

336
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The number of people who have that...</font>

337
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...are few.</font>

338
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On top of that, if they're 
to work in the demon forest,</font>

339
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'd best have high magicule resistance.</font>

340
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The third royal order boasts 
mental and physical strength,</font>

341
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we're skilled at 
controlling our magic.</font>

342
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no point in having magical 
energy if you can't control it.</font>

343
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean magical 
energy can go out of control?</font>

344
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

345
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why children with such tendencies</font>

346
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are usually left in the care of churches.</font>

347
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Churches?</font>

348
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Come to think of it, there are barrier 
spells cast all over the church.</i></font>

349
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Moreover, nobles, commoners,
and orphans all work there together.</i></font>

350
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That must be bringing together people
 with strong magical energy</i></font>

351
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and resistance to magicules,

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, Aresh-sama...</font>

353
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm casting another barrier layer.</font>

354
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at me.</font>

355
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mean like that.</font>

356
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

357
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama! I'm too heavy!</font>
