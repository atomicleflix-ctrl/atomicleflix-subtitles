<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let myself...</font>

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">take the Magecraft society

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you have quite an interesting way
of putting up a struggle.</font>

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An Einzbern...</font>

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wounds...</font>

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha...</font>

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is your Master, see?</font>

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You should hurry up and make the pact.</font>

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good boy.</font>

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,570

22

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But at the least,
make sacrificing yourself look fun.</font>

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay?</font>

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may look like this,
but I like humans, okay?</font>

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that I'm here...</font>

37
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, the one that assaulted
the police station.</font>

38
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised you survived it.</font>

39
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Saber happened to be
there, and he saved me.</font>

00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What?</i></font>

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He proposed a ceasefire afterward...</font>

42
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I accepted.</font>

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you repeat that?</font>

59
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Lancer. Charlie Chaplin.</font>

60
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the Servant I summoned.</font>

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>I'll be asking him about his Noble

63
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,220

sense her anymore.</font>

64
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you take spirit form
if you knew she was there?</font>

65
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I tell you?</font>

66
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are nothing more than Shadows.</font>

67

68
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,320

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That look on your face... Are you angry?</font>

71
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're such an easy read.</font>

72
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, my boy...</font>

73
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chaplin, huh?</font>

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why a comedian of all people?</font>

77
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is it?</font>

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Classical comedy is your thing.</font>

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's unexpected.</font>

80
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've watched comedy multiple times
and appreciate it.</font>

81
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}But I've never laughed
from the bottom of my heart.</font>

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you can come in!</font>

83
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you able to sleep
at least a little bit?</font>

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

85
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were a lifesaver by
letting us use the room.</font>

86
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to that, Ayaka is feeling good now.</font>

87
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

88
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your name?</font>

89
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Sigma.</font>

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm one of the Masters
of the Holy Grail War.</font>

91
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you figure out anything
about the case of that curse?</font>

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing on that end yet.</font>

93
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I had a report that Halri Vorzak

96
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,200

with the demon from the Scladio Family?</font>

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, is that the captain of the Argo?</font>

98
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's likely because we're connected

128
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,170

any soul formed in it,</font>

129
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,860

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You tried to shoot a god dead.</font>

139
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Self-proclaimed goddess,
why have you trampled into our base?</font>

140
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, this is a Holy Grail War, right?</font>

141
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only natural to eradicate enemy
forces that don't strike your fancy.</font>

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though, I'm neither Master nor Servant!</font>

143
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-The space is being transformed
into a labyrinth!</font>

144
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! You finally deployed
your bounded field?</font>

145
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're really taking your time here.</font>

146
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, this is how it was meant to be used.</font>

147
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No way!</font>

148
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be able to deploy a bounded field
on such a giant workshop...</font>

149
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then transform it
into an underworld...</font>

150
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a composite artwork
of the Scladio Family.</font>

151
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will be rather difficult...</font>

152
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even for an adept Mage
to get out of there.</font>

153
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm, I see!</font>

154
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can tell whoever made this
must be an unpleasant personality.</font>

155
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it on your order
that she came here, Halri Vorzak?</font>

156
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I...</font>

157
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am...</font>

158
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>Papa!</i></font>

159
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Mama!</i></font>

160
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We came here at Ms. Philia's suggestion.</font>

161
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I merely tagged along.</font>

162
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So, that thing is called "Philia."</font>

163
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that thing?</font>

164
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The person who saved my life.</font>

165
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stymphalian Birds?</font>

166
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Not bad.</font>

167
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Philia!</font>

168
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking the other way?
Such confidence.</font>

169
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

170
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, what a good little one.</font>

171
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, Halri!</font>

172
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the Master,
so hurry up and give your orders.</font>

173
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

174
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm asking you. Who is your enemy?</font>

175
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you let it be,</font>

176
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it will kill off everyone
other than you and me. Is that okay?</font>

177
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The enemy is...</font>

178
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The enemy is...</font>

179
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The enemy is...</font>

180
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this magical workshop!</font>

181
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tear it down to pieces...</font>

182
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Berserker!</font>

183
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that?</font>

184
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Halri...</font>

185
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What in the world...</font>

186
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">did you summon?</font>

187
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Ayaka.</font>

188
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My Master... she is not,
but she's my partner.</font>

189
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you... Sigma.</font>

190
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

192
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assume it'd be too much to ask
to introduce me to your Servant.</font>

193
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He called it "Chaplin."</font>

194
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chaplin as in...</font>

195
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was a movie at the
music club yesterday!</font>

196
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I definitely would like an introduction!</font>

197
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He says that actors are
to be seen in movies,</font>

198
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so he doesn't show himself in person.</font>

199
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

200
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can agree to that.</font>

201
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can?</font>

202
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was contacting someone.</font>

203
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is the mastermind
pulling your strings?</font>

204
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Answer me!</font>

205
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on!</font>

206
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What will you do, my boy?</font>

207
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a mercenary, and I
was contacting my client.</font>

208
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

209
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't say any further.</font>

210
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

211
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be in trouble if you kept
probing around, so please stop that.</font>

212
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So honest! What an interesting fellow!</font>

213
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're one to say that.</font>

214
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, how about this?</font>

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to form
an alliance with us, as well?</font>

216
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't share that much about myself,</font>

217
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I think it'll be difficult
to earn your trust.</font>

218
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Therefore, I wouldn't mind agreeing
if it's a ceasefire.</font>

219
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm...</font>

220
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh well, I guess that's okay!</font>

221
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you lost your mind?</font>

222
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not okay?</font>

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

224
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">decided, as well.</font>

225
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That, at the least, I
will try to trust Saber.</font>

226
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, now, I will for you, as well.</font>

227
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Saber.</font>

228
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it possible for me to connect
the... path... was it... with this person?</font>

229
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, leave that to me!</font>

230
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My gratitude.</font>

231
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That girl's got a surprising
amount of gusto.</font>

232
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that king, too.</font>

233
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be careful.</font>

234
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I think with that,
we have no objections.</font>

235
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may be only for a short while,
but nice to work with you...</font>

236
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sigma.</font>

237
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Destroy the workshop, huh?</font>

238
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dodged that one pretty well.</font>

239
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't tell it directly to kill?</font>

240
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's not like I dodged it...</font>

241
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not blaming you for anything, okay?</font>

242
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, Halri, if you were a kid
who would say "Kill people" so easily...</font>

243
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'd no longer be human—</font>

244
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, you should run for it.</font>

245
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we're not careful in how we kill them,
mud will splatter everywhere.</font>

246
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, we have to be careful
how we get rid of them.</font>

247
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way! You're kidding!</font>

248
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is amazing, Halri!</font>

249
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was only brought in so we'd</font>

250
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">have enough people, but she
summoned something amazing!</font>

251
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... this scene is almost over.</font>

252
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well then, I'm going to
give the order, okay?</font>

253
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will have you cleanly wrap up
that battle between those monsters!</font>

254
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's an order I'd like to refuse
even if you used a Command Spell on me.</font>

255
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finally have all the actors,</font>

256
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if the folks above
Faldeus make their move,</font>

257
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this perfect stage would be ruined,
don't you think?</font>

258
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So... you'll head out there for me, right?</font>

259
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to stop this?</font>

260
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great! This is the best!</font>

261
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the best, me!</font>

262
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I mean, Halri, if you were a kid

266
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,670

all of my Magical Energy!</font>

267
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, please!</font>

268
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, destroy it!</font>

269
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Destroy everything!</font>

270
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the Mages created!</font>

271
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of it!</font>

272

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like there was
a fire out in the city.</font>
