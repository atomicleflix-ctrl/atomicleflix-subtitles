00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,770

143
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,250

144
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,960

145
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,430

146
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,480

he's killed 40 people, right?</font>

147
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's not going to be a

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,070

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, well, I hear you,</font>

258
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's nothing I can 
do if no one's showing up.</font>

259
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?</i></font>

260
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you mouthing off to me now?</font>

261
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Look, I'm sorry!</font>

262
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please forgive me!</i></font>

263
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you get too uppity,</font>

264
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll run you over.</font>

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to be wary of the past 
sorcerers who incarnated.</font>

266
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My thoughts, too.</font>

267
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But explain it to me 
again, Fushiguro-kun.</font>

268
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some of them are from 
a thousand years ago.</font>

269
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet the value of a life was way different 
even a hundred or two hundred years ago.</font>

270
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plus, they're sorcerers.</font>

271
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fighting and death are common for them.</font>

272
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some may want to die fighting.</font>

273
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That might even be why they 
forged a pact with Kenjaku.</font>

274
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a strong chance that Higuruma 
and Kashimo are past sorcerers.</font>

275
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't expect a proper negotiation.</font>

276
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then the other aggressive ones are 
going to be cursed spirits, huh?</font>

277
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially at night.</font>

278
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they're a modern day sorcerer 
dragged into this like Tsumiki,</font>

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they actually might be open 
to exchanging information.</font>

280
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I'm Kogane!</font>

you, too, become a Player!</font>

284
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, no issues here.</font>

285
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Megumi Fushiguro has

286
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,260

287
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need. I'm fine.</font>

288
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,960

291
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,780

292
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, we gather information on Higuruma.</font>

293
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

294
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

295
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,350

301
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's one!</font>

305
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This would have turned

308
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Darling, let's meet up.</font>

309
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She fell easily.</i></font>

310
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,930

311

313
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you do to my woman?!</font>

314
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess I can just ask him.</font>

315
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Haba-san flew in.</i></font>

316
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Was Hanyu-san taken out?</i></font>

317

321
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who attacked me.</font>

322
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Damn it!</i></font>

323
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,490

324
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,690

325
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Nue can't find him, either.</i></font>

332
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm sorry.</font>

333
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By Higuruma, you mean <i>that</i> guy, right?</font>

334
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one with 100 points?</font>

335
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know where he is?</font>

336
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So that's how it is.</font>

337
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,070

338
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,260

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought I'd be in trouble with him

341
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He keeps coming in close

342
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll fight him indoors!</i></font>

343
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll turn you into a smoothie!</font>

344
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's turned his head toward me!</i></font>

345
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That earlier airplane woman</i></font>

347
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but she fell from such

349
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,830

350
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Because of a pact?</i></font>

351
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But no matter how tough it may be, 
it's still their head.</i></font>

352
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As long as I can attack it,</i></font>

353
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can crack it open!</i></font>

354
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Broke your fist, did ya?
You just lost this battle!</font>

355
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,600

356
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,020

368
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,730
