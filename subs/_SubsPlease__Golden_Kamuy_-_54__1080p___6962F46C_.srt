00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those two weren't Japanese either.</font>

9
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their weapons were Swiss.</font>

10
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw that woman in the Otaru hospital.</font>

11
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They followed us all the

12
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They probably followed Asirpa, I'm sure...</font>

13
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they seem to have it out for us.</font>

14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we kill her before she wakes up?</font>

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we take her prisoner 
to learn what she knows.</font>

16
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she's with Kiroranke, there should 
be more of her friends nearby.</font>

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're changing plans.</font>

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, we hide Asirpa 
somewhere safe nearby.</font>

36
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seen that guy with

40
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He talked all that crap about 
wanting to be a king...</font>

41
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I think in the end,</font>

42
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he just wanted to get back the 
family and homeland he lost.</font>

43
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you never heard anything 
about the Ainu from him?</font>

44
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, he told me everything.</font>

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lieutenant Tsurumi, we found this

61
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you trying to spy on Lt. Tsurumi?!</font>

62
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you, Lieutenant Koito?</font>

63
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say to believe in you, and 
your belief in Lieutenant Tsurumi!</font>

64
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you don't believe him, do you?</font>

65
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I believe in him!</font>

66
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't just decide that.</font>

67
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why did you say...</font>

68
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was a tattooed prisoner 
underground, but he escaped.</font>

69
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until now, you've spoken 
with a fast Satsuma accent.</font>

70
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stopped believing in him at some 
point, without even realizing it, right?</font>

71

73
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hide someplace far away 
so you won't be spotted.</font>

74
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

75
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if the others come 
back, keep them away.</font>

76
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Strengthen our defense outside.</font>

77
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He just checked that there 
was no one outside.</font>

78
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there something he doesn't want heard?</font>

79
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was definitely
Lieutenant Koito, right?</font>

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, he went into that church.</font>

81
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure Asirpa-chan is inside.</font>

82
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to break in and save her?</font>

83
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we'll bring Hijikata and the others.</font>

84
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're at too much of a 
disadvantage with just one gun.</font>

85
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we need to hurry.</font>

86
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can't trust any information 
he learns through torture.</font>

87
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lieutenant Tsurumi's going to take his 
time to put pressure on her.</font>

88
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know that.</font>

89
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was acting a little 
crazy in Karafuto.</font>

90
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's right.</font>

91
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to bust in there 
right now even more than I do.</font>

92
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, let's hurry and 
bring reinforcements!</font>

93
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asirpa!</font>

94
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take this off,
but you mustn't scream.</font>

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,070

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There we go. A brave Ainu girl, 
hachimaki wrapped around her head.</font>

97
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We didn't get to talk enough 
at Karafuto, Asirpa.</font>

98
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And... Sofia Goldenhand.</font>

99
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The "Golden Hand." Quite the title.</font>

100
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The people see you as the shining 
golden hand, the noble thief.</font>

101
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're also the cursed golden hand,</font>

102
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who's sacrificed many people 
for the sake of the revolution.</font>

103
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had a feeling I'd run into you again!</font>

104
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

105
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should expect you wouldn't recognize me.</font>

145
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Japanese man running a photography

146
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thousands of Japanese live in this city.</font>

147
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of them must've been odd enough to

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a common name in Niigata.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that "Hasegawa" was
Lieutenant Tsurumi, huh?</i></font>

154
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Around 50 years ago...</font>

155
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A group of Ainu extremists gathered 
gold dust as part of a certain plan.</font>

156
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their plan was to buy warships, weapons,</font>

157
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,690

158
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,210

will go out of control.</font>

160
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But just before the

161
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a Russian warship collided with a

162
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone involved in the trade

163
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With no use for it, the Ainu
