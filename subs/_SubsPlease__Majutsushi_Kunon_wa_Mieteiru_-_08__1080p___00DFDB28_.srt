1
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been five days 
since we left the manor.</font>

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long does it take to get to 
Dirashik, where the magic school is?</font>

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're still in the Kingdom of Hughlia.</font>

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this rate, maybe a month.</font>

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That long? It's so far.</font>

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, it is.</font>

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we should be at 
Grandfather's manor soon.</font>

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Iko?</font>

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really sure this is it?</font>

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, this is where we say goodbye.</font>

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to get married.</font>

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm already a bit past marriageable age,
so it's now or never.</font>

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I give up now, I think I'll give up 
on the idea for the rest of my life.</font>

15
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think I can live on without you?</font>

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you marry me then, Master Kunon?</font>

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you leave Princess 
Mirika and take me?</font>

18
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, now I can see the manor.</font>

19
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}FAREWELLS AND HELLOS AND DIRASHIK</font>

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been four years since
I came to visit the main family.</font>

21
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, why did I come here four years ago?</font>

22
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you remember?</font>

23
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having heard that there 
was a huge library here,</font>

24
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you thought there might be books on magic 
and dragged your whole family here.</font>

25
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, did I?</font>

26
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't stop dancing until 
you say you'll take me there!</font>

27
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Darling, listen to Kunon.</font>

28
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. I got it, Kunon.</font>

29
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take you there!</font>

30
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back then, you did everything you 
could to learn magic, Master Kunon.</font>

31
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true.</font>

32
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kunon!</font>

33
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandfather!</font>

34
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've grown big!</font>

35
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must always be a bigger 
man than I was yesterday.</font>

36
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, indeed!</font>

37
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been four years. I've missed you so!</font>

38
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so good to see you!</font>

39
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Mother is a hero and Grandfather 
is a demon lord, huh?</i></font>

40
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Tinalisa well?</font>

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, she's doing so well she 
could totally defeat you.</font>

42
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very good, very good.</font>

43
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To celebrate your enrollment at the magic 
school, I shall buy you anything you want.</font>

44
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no...</font>

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Regent. I have a letter 
for you from Lady Tinalisa.</font>

46
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need to be shy.</font>

47
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want gems? Jewels?</font>

48
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's call a jeweler here now.</font>

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone!</font>

50
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Regent! Here's a 
letter from your daughter!</font>

51
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must not spend over five 
hundred thousand necca on Kunon?</font>

52
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not a child's allowance!</font>

53
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A twelve-year-old is a child.</font>

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two months of my salary.</font>

55
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine if she doesn't find out, right?</font>

56
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandfather.</font>

57
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, you want it secretly?</font>

58
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall I buy you a large vessel secretly?</font>

59
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, please send for my new maid.</font>

60
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here so she can take over from Iko.</font>

61
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

62
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go get her.</font>

63
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Rinko Round! I'm eighteen!</font>

64
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I applied for this job because 
the pay wasn't too bad!</font>

65
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to open my own store in the future</font>

66
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and also save up for wedding expenses, 
so I agreed to this position!</font>

67
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, um... Nice to meet you.</font>

68
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Iko's little sister, right?</font>

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. My sister recommended this job to me.</font>

70
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, I already have 
a fiancé, unlike her.</font>

71
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to beat you up?</font>

72
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's not what I mean.</font>

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm saying I'm not open to 
being contracted as a mistress.</font>

74
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to worry about that.</font>

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a fiancée as well,</font>

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so you should cherish your fiancé 
more than the three mealtimes of the day.</font>

77
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will!</font>

78
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, my mealtimes...?</font>

79
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't want to?</font>

80
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will do my best!</font>

81
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We promised that we'd 
open the store together.</font>

82
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I need money for that, too!</font>

83
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two are alike.</font>

84
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was worried you might not 
get my sense of humor.</font>

85
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People have called us lively 
sisters since we were small.</font>

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking forward to serving you!</font>

87
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They do look alike.</i></font>

88
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was nervous since you told me 
he was the scion of a marquis</font>

89
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and a sorcerer with a Hero's Scar,</font>

90
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he seems easygoing.</font>

91
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When he's focused on magic, 
he forgets to eat.</font>

92
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So make him sandwiches so 
he can eat while he studies.</font>

93
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His favorite sandwiches are Hamburg 
steak and bacon, you said?</font>

94
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. And milk tea.</font>

95
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ask if he wants it without 
milk or without tea.</font>

96
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know I'll get along just fine.</font>

97
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I'm sure you will.</font>

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to attend Master Kunon?</font>

99
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your reputation precedes you.</font>

100
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Am I famous?!</font>

101
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will I get swarmed by suitors?</font>

102
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm still young and I'm not ready!</font>

103
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what we need.</font>

104
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought he could use someone like you.</font>

105
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you, Master Kunon.</font>

106
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Iko, and I will be 
taking care of you starting today.</font>

107
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Iko?</font>

108
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

109
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's lettuce.</font>

110
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lettuce?</font>

111
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what's this?</font>

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's mustard.</font>

113
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, so dashing!</font>

114
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon, perhaps <i>you</i> were the 
model for the classic storybook prince?</font>

115
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Alas, my true identity has been revealed.</font>

116
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for not telling you the truth.</font>

117
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plus, you'll be perfectly
 fine on your own now.</font>

118
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be.</font>

119
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Jenié left me, Lady Flora left me, 
and if you leave me, too...</font>

120
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rinko.</font>

121
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

122
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon is still a child.</font>

123
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's earnest and listens 
to people around him.</font>

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm telling you, if you put 
any weird ideas in his head,</font>

125
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'll have me to answer to.</font>

126
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll beat you up if you 
teach him anything naughty.</font>

127
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anything naughty?</font>

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like chasing skirts?</font>

129
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it! I don't want to hear it!</font>

130
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon is the sweetest angel!</font>

131
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if some random cunning, dingy 
wench comes in contact with him...</font>

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I can't stand the thought!</font>

133
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Princess Mirika is the only one who 
is allowed to touch him as a woman!</font>

134
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only Princess Mirika!</font>

135
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got it.</font>

136
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll watch out for his 
relationships with women.</font>

137
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know, Master Kunon is a 
gentleman, so he's kind to women.</font>

138
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He almost always speaks to them 
and gives them compliments,</font>

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so he's just an easy target 
for women, you know?</font>

140
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you describe him so terribly?</font>

141
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because that's what you told me.</font>

142
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, it only follows that 
he'll become a womanizer.</font>

143
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it! Master Kunon would never do that!</font>

144
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's an angel!</font>

145
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, let's be real.</font>

146
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you so obsessed—</font>

147
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He won't!</font>

148
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon would never!</font>

149
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mmm, it's tasty!</font>

150
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially this bacon.</font>

151
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Smoked by the warmth and 
love of you two sisters,</font>

152
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like even I'm getting 
smokey and aromatic.</font>

153
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See what I mean?</font>

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He will not!</font>

155
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, Master Kunon.</font>

156
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time for your departure.</font>

157
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

158
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Iko.</font>

159
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

160
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you remember what I said after 
Miss Jenié and Lady Flora quit?</font>

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That I'd never be fine if you left me.</font>

162
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

163
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, I'm away from 
Father, Mother, Big Brother,</font>

164
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Royal Sorcerers, and my master...
not to mention Princess Mirika.</font>

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now I'll be away from you 
and go to the magic school.</font>

166
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this is what I wanted 
and decided for myself.</font>

167
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

168
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be away from me, but we're 
only apart. You won't be gone. Right?</font>

169
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. You can see 
me when you come home.</font>

170
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will continue this work in 
Hughlia after I get married.</font>

171
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be a few years until I see you next.</font>

172
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By then, I may have a child.</font>

173
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An adorable child like you.</font>

174
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please take care, Master Kunon.</font>

175
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for everything, Iko.</font>

176
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you must go?</font>

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to, Kunon.</font>

178
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you live here with me?</font>

179
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Start the carriage.</font>

180
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you!</font>

181
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kunon, wait for me!</font>

182
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kunon!</font>

183
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure it was fine to leave?</font>

184
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lord regent was still 
saying something to you.</font>

185
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I respond, it will only 
take longer, so it's fine.</font>

186
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyhow, thank you for coming 
to work for me, Rinko.</font>

187
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my pleasure!</font>

188
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your fiancé will have to wait for 
several years. Are you sure you're okay?</font>

189
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! He said he'd wait, since it 
was to make money for our store.</font>

190
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of store is it going to be?</font>

191
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A shady business of sweeping 
people under the rug?</font>

192
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did think about that,</font>

193
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I decided on a restaurant.</font>

194
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like eating, and they're kind of 
the same thing. Plus, it's legal.</font>

195
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. The only difference is</font>

196
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">sustaining people with food or 
getting rid of them in the dark.</font>

197
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A new life begins.</i></font>

198
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm starting everything anew.</i></font>

199
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I will meet new people.</i></font>

200
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, this isn't too bad.</font>

201
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, so many magic stores!</font>

202
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because it's close to Dirashik.</font>

203
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means Dirashik is a 
nation of amazing magic?</font>

204
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are all these books on magic? Incredible!</font>

205
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lord regent's library was way bigger.</font>

206
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But didn't have a lot of books on magic.</font>

207
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only read a handful so far.</font>

208
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to buy some now, then?</font>

209
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll end up on the streets.</font>

210
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Um...</font>

211
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}5 MILLION NECCA</font>

212
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?!</font>

213
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this price?!</font>

214
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The book alone can cover a store for me 
and my fiancé, plus a branch store!</font>

215
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic books are one of a kind.</font>

216
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why each book costs a fortune.</font>

217
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too expensive!</font>

218
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rinko, you shouldn't be 
too loud in a store—</font>

219
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you a sorcerer, too?</font>

220
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A student at the magic 
school by any chance?</font>

221
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm an applicant.</font>

222
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you use magic, then?</font>

223
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What attribute?</font>

224
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Water.</font>

225
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show me, show me!</font>

226
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, if it's a request from a lady.</font>

227
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

228
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, so tiny!</font>

229
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cute!</font>

230
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is amazing!</font>

231
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

232
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you a sorcerer as well?</font>

233
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I just love magic, and I really 
wanted to work in the field of magic.</font>

234
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I'm a magic enthusiast.</font>

235
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My gosh, today is my day!</font>

236
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To meet a sorcerer who can 
use such adorable spell!</font>

237
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dirashik is intense these days, 
so best of luck to you.</font>

238
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Intense?</font>

239
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. This year, the saint of the 
Holy Kingdom is enrolling as well.</font>

240
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Saint.</font>

241
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Last year, they had the Inferno Prince and 
Lightning Bolt of the New Kingdom.</font>

242
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now you're joining them.</font>

243
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be so famous!</font>

244
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, I'm looking forward to it.</font>

245
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know!</font>

246
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just got a secondhand grimoire of the 
most popular sorcerer, Zeonly Finroll.</font>

247
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you a special discount.</font>

248
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no thank you.</font>

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Why?</font>

250
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}MUMBLE MUMBLE MUMBLE MUMBLE</font>

251
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This single book is worth 
my store, my dream...</font>

252
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't realize it would 
shock you that much.</font>

253
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course it did.</font>

254
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, that grimoire 
really was a great bargain.</font>

255
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you don't want it?</font>

256
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. I know the contents, and 
it's most likely the clean copy I made.</font>

257
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

258
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I check out next?</font>

259
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh no. This well-dressed child 
with a maid came into the store,</i></font>

260
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and now he's touching the merchandise.</i></font>

261
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's going on?!</i></font>

262
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me, sir?</font>

263
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me, ma'am?</font>

264
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Woo-hoo!</font>

265
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

266
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A veggie thief will hang, you hear me?</font>

267
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rinko, this is great.</font>

268
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's <i>not</i> great!</font>

269
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think you're doing? 
Stop touching my merchandise!</font>

270
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please pay me no mind.</font>

271
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to! I can't help it!</font>

272
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was trying to memorize the texture.</font>

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Simple words like "cloth" and 
"fur" can cover diverse textures.</font>

274
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Texture?</font>

275
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What fur is this?</font>

276
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's dark fox.</font>

277
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's very rare, so please do not touch it—</font>

278
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}A-ori.</font>

279
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dark fox?!</font>

280
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, I should have asked for 
your permission before I did this.</font>

281
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can reproduce animals 
with magic? I see.</font>

282
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you reproduce anything 
if you know the texture?</font>

283
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Reproducing only 
shape and texture, though.</font>

284
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then... what about a woman?</font>

285
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hell are you suggesting to a child?!</font>

286
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm sorry!</font>

287
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry isn't gonna cut it, tainting 
precious Master Kunon's ears!</font>

288
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reproducing a human is 
too complicated, so no.</font>

289
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I get yelled at so much.</font>

290
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Master Kunon.</font>

291
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This store is for trashy adults!</font>

292
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry!</font>

293
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only asked on impulse!</font>

294
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I have a crush on this lady,</font>

295
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I gave into the temptation 
that maybe I could lay with her!</font>

296
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut your piehole!</font>

297
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll taint Master Kunon's heart, too.</font>

298
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This town is bad for your education!</font>

299
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us hurry to Dirashik!</font>

300
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you're mad, you're scarier than Iko.</font>

301
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did I utter toward a child...?</font>

302
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, welcome.</font>

303
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wonderful to see you, Your Reverence.</font>

304
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been told that you have 
a rare scarf made of dark fox.</font>

305
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I see it?</font>

306
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dark fox?</font>

307
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought they didn't like humans.</font>

308
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, this? This is...</font>

309
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a spell.</font>

310
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't 
expect it to be water.</font>

311
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That dark fox was water?</font>

312
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Water attribute magic?</font>

313
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">E-Excuse me...</font>

314
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not move!</font>

315
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry!</font>

316
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way it burst, it seemed it was 
made with small amount of magical power.</font>

317
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That child and now these people.</i></font>

318
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What kind of torturous day is it today?!</i></font>

319
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's a spell outside of my knowledge.</i></font>

320
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're here!</font>

321
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in Dirashik, Master Kunon!</font>

322
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

323
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm finally here at the magic school!</font>

324
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be tired from the 
long journey, Master Kunon.</font>

325
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please rest well today.</font>

326
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Same to you, Rinko.</font>

327
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon, you'll 
live in a dorm, right?</font>

328
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basically, all students at the 
magic school will live in the dorm.</font>

329
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we ask, an attendant 
can live with us.</font>

330
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, but the dorm is full
and there's no vacancy.</font>

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

332
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The application for the 
dorm is long past due.</font>

333
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't know?</font>

334
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master never mentioned that to me.</font>

335
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a bold entrance.</font>

336
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it meant to shock me?</font>

337
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or are you here to play?</font>

338
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to speak to you. Urgently.</font>

339
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's about my beloved student.</font>

340
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is bad.</font>

341
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

342
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to stay at a hotel?</font>

343
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The funds from your family can cover that.</font>

344
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm. Since I'll be here for several 
years while attending the magic school,</font>

345
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">can I rent a house for longer stay?</font>

346
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure there will be expenses 
for magic-related stuff,</font>

347
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'd like to save where I can.</font>

348
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think? Rent a 
small house and live together?</font>

349
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Is this a proposal?</font>

350
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

351
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Information on real estate agents?</font>

352
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We give it out to the applicants 
who couldn't get into the dorm.</font>

353
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real estate agents on that list</font>

354
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">can show you some 
nice properties for sorcerers.</font>

355
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

356
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A life for just the two of us begins!</font>

357
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in.</font>

358
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've brought the list 
of incoming students.</font>

359
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear we have the cream 
of the crop this year.</font>

360
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Some are eligible 
for the Advanced class.</font>

361
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

362
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently he's a student of Zeonly.</font>

363
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm. That man took a student, huh?</font>

364
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kunon Gurion.</font>

367
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:00,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. No one can enter except for the 
students and authorized people.</font>

368
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would this help, by any chance?</font>

369
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it won't.</font>

370
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please watch your step.</font>

371
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

372
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look strict, but you're 
actually very kind, my lady.</font>

374
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me.</font>

375
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid I don't know what to call you,</font>

376
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but not having a name is also tantalizing.</font>

377
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not having a name?</font>

378
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a name, and it's Loubella... oh.</font>

379
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a beautiful name.</font>

380
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sounds of "lou" and "bella" 
are especially excellent.</font>

381
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As if you took "lou" and 
"bella" and put them together.</font>
