3
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, how unusual.</i></font>

4
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're up early.</font>

5
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Did I wake you?</font>

6
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always get up around this time.</font>

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should sleep in.</font>

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You had quite the scuffle yesterday.</font>

9
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine.</font>

10
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

11
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

12
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, look.</font>

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

14
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he a noble? 
He's not the local lord, right?</font>

15
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, look who's next to him. 
That's the Blade.</font>

16
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that's him?</font>

17
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who should I tell if I have 
information to share?</font>

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't ask me.</font>

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning!</font>

20
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can I help you?</font>

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to update a map.</font>

23
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Certainly. For which labyrinth?</font>

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Crystal Ruins.</font>

25
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Crystal Ruins?!</font>

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That old labyrinth's been 
thoroughly explored.</font>

27
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The map hasn't been updated in years.</font>

28
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I found something.</font>

29
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You... found something?</font>

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute.</font>

31
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lying's a pretty risky play.</font>

32
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you that desperate 
to show off to Layla?</font>

33
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that your name?</font>

34
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

35
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a cute name.</font>

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop trying to seduce her!</font>

38
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A twink like you has new information 
on the Crystal Ruins of all places?</font>

39
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's impossible!</font>

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So?</font>

41
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-So? So, uh...</font>

42
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sh-Show us the proof!</font>

43
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is proof required to update a map?</font>

44
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's not necessary.</font>

45
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any lies would be exposed anyway, and no 
one would risk the loss of credibility.</font>

46
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So go right ahead!</font>

47
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I don't believe you!</font>

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine. As long as 
the guild believes me.</font>

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but... since I do have proof, 
I might as well show you.</font>

50
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-A strategy guide?</font>

52
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does this satisfy you?</font>

53
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-There can't be anything new in that.</font>

54
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was a hidden room and 
even a treasure chest.</font>

55
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Naturally, we took it.</font>

56
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's still worth entering.</font>

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a very rare monster inside.</font>

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait!</font>

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't share more than that.</font>

60
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. That's all I'll say.</font>

61
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, this is my first 
time sharing information.</font>

62
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it.</font>

63
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a very accurate map.</font>

64
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I tell you about 
any traps as well?</font>

65
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll receive a greater 
reward if you do.</font>

66
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One moment, please.</font>

68
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll get set up right away.</font>

69
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come closer to the counter, please.</font>

70
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. A silencer.</font>

71
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ones you have here also 
block out outside voices.</font>

72
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Depends on the silencer.</font>

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead.</font>

74
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This looks like an ordinary wall at first 
glance, but this section can be destroyed.</font>

75
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. A destructible labyrinth wall
would've been overlooked.</font>

76
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil kicked the wall down.</font>

77
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He kicked it down?!</font>

78
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was about this thick.</font>

79
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a proper wall!</font>

80
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but it's made of crystal.</font>

81
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be really hard!</font>

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like kicking down a brick wall.</font>

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not something people can do.</font>

84
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beyond that, there was an altar.</font>

85
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Opening the treasure chest there 
triggered a teleportation spell,</font>

86
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then...</font>

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. That sends you to this room.</font>

88
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, we fell.</font>

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You fell?!</font>

90
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A magic circle transported us into a 
crystal pit about two meters across.</font>

91
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it a bit less than two minutes?</font>

92
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds right.</font>

93
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It felt long, but it really wasn't.</font>

94
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Were you all right?</font>

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do we look like we weren't?</font>

96
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, no.</font>

97
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, there was a subterranean 
dragon at the bottom.</font>

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It attacked with its breath 
weapon as we fell.</font>

99
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also...</font>

100
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

101
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You fell several kilometers,</font>

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a subterranean dragon
was waiting at the bottom,</font>

103
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you took a direct hit 
from its breath weapon?</font>

104
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's absolutely brutal!</font>

105
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You knocked this over.</font>

106
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe I did that.</font>

107
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we've already come this 
far, I have one other thing...</font>

108
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of scale is that?</font>

109
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A subterranean dragon? It's huge.</font>

110
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you believe me now?</font>

111
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, yes.</font>

112
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

113
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

114
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I'd give this to you.</font>

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, it seems some 
people don't believe us.</font>

116
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're giving...?</font>

117
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could probably sell 
this for a lot of money.</font>

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all right. 
We harvested plenty more.</font>

119
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-In that case, could I see your guild 
card to certify your information?</font>

120
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Certainly.</font>

121
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Rank F?!</i></font>

122
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is everything all right?</font>

123
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I feel like you're ready 
to apply for a promotion.</font>

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's been less than two months 
since I became an adventurer.</font>

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But...</font>

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I know someone who'd be 
unhappy if I raised my rank here.</font>

127
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

128
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing.</font>

129
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's coddling him again.</i></font>

130
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is your reward.</font>

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

132
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop by anytime to offer more 
information or take on jobs.</font>

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would it be better if I raised my rank?</font>

134
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

135
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't look good for 
your leader to be rank F.</font>

136
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't bother me.</font>

137
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care what people say about me,</font>

138
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I wouldn't want others to doubt 
your achievements because of me.</font>

139
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot. It wouldn't bother me if they did.</font>

140
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't matter if your rank is S or 
F or if you're a king or a criminal.</font>

141
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be here either way.</font>

142
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should probably avoid criminals.</font>

143
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it.</font>

144
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a big shop.</font>

145
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is nice, but I believe Judge's 
shop carries higher quality products.</font>

146
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They serve different customers.</font>

147
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True.</font>

148
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

149
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you here to meet Mr. Judge?</font>

150
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

151
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been told to take you to him.</font>

152
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way, please.</font>

153
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Judge, your guests have arrived.</font>

154
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Lizel and Mr. Gil, I am so sorry!</font>

155
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I planned to wait for 
you downstairs, but...</font>

156
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can relax.</font>

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're our client. You can throw 
your weight around.</font>

158
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd never do that.</font>

159
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did we arrive early?</font>

160
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Not at all. My grandfather has 
been giving me gifts, and...</font>

161
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judge! Take this, too.</font>

162
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've already given me enough.</font>

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil, huh?</font>

165
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judge told me about you,
but you really haven't changed.</font>

166
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up.</font>

167
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been putting that to good use.</font>

168
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You better not be slacking 
on maintaining it.</font>

169
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not.</font>

170
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. And you must be...</font>

171
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Lizel.</font>

172
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm terribly sorry for dragging 
your grandson into our trouble</font>

173
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and ruining your family's time together 
on the first day of our visit.</font>

174
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was thinking about giving 
you a piece of my mind,</font>

175
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you apologized before I could.</font>

176
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Mr. Lizel, would you 
like to have lunch with us?</font>

177
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

178
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My grandfather said he'd 
like to speak with you.</font>

179
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm honored. Please allow us to join you.</font>

180
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The name's Insigh.</font>

181
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear you've been helping my grandson.</font>

182
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I receive far more help from him.</font>

183
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always stop by his shop 
anytime I need anything.</font>

184
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're an adventurer, right? 
You don't look like one.</font>

185
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandfather!</font>

186
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you a mighty adventurer? 
Then eat like one.</font>

187
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandfather!</font>

188
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been working on my appetite.</font>

189
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, was it two 
years ago that you met?</font>

190
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

191
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he recommended that sword to you.</font>

192
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say he recommended it...</font>

193
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't even tell what 
weapon's right for you?!</font>

194
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are there any swords that would suit me?</font>

195
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You've never properly swung a 
sword in your life. Don't be absurd.</font>

196
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show me what you're using now.</font>

197
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is it.</font>

198
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want a sword when you can use this?</font>

199
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't want to waste the opportunity.</font>

200
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, you're screwed up in the head.</font>

201
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The head?</font>

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you're curious?</font>

203
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His gun uses mana control.</font>

204
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Few mages can manage such 
precise control over mana.</font>

205
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then Mr. Lizel must be amazing.</font>

206
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, amazing for even considering it.</font>

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He uses mana control to 
aim and position the gun,</font>

208
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">control the recoil,
and even pull the trigger.</font>

209
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me give you an example.</font>

210
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try singing a song in 
your head. You got it?</font>

211
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

212
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now add another song.</font>

213
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep playing both at the same time.</font>

214
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like that.</font>

215
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Insigh, I can't do that either.</font>

216
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just a comparison.</font>

217
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm saying your head's just that crazy.</font>

218
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll prepare for our departure.</font>

219
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make yourselves at home.</font>

220
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not having dessert with your 
grandpa on your last day here?</font>

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We had lunch together because 
you said the same thing.</font>

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, I have a request.</font>

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

224
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you give this to someone?</font>

225
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These are the tunnels beneath Marcade.</font>

226
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd you get this?</font>

227
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a coincidence.</font>

228
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A coincidence?</font>

229
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It happened to be stuck in 
a book I won at an auction.</font>

230
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, who am I giving this to?</font>

231
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Count Shadow. You know him, don't you?</font>

232
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What makes you say that?</font>

233
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was written in this book.</font>

234
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure love books.</font>

235
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Marcadia Company was involved in 
Marcade's development, wasn't it?</font>

236
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you think I still work with 
them because my grandfather did?</font>

237
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm certain you do.</font>

238
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judge is a good and very dutiful boy.</font>

239
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man who raised him 
undoubtedly is as well.</font>

240
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you got me.</font>

241
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you know his name, 
have you met him?</font>

242
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. He treated me to dinner.</font>

243
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean you extorted him.</font>

244
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did that to Shadow?</font>

245
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking with a worthy opponent must've 
been a nice breather for him.</font>

246
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

247
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not eating this.</font>

248
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a waste.</font>

249
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make sure this map 
gets to him. Don't worry.</font>

250
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate that.</font>

251
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I mention your name, too?</font>

252
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd like.</font>

253
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm certain he'll make 
a sour face, though.</font>

254
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's no good.
I'll be sure to tell him.</font>

255
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Insigh.</font>

256
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

257
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to ask you for something else.</font>

258
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You trying to charm me?</font>

259
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're pretty big.</font>

260
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judging by the shape, are they 
a subterranean dragon's?</font>

261
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed.</font>

262
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're a beautiful jade color. 
So, what about these?</font>

263
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to sell them to you.</font>

264
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If possible, could you run a large-scale 
advertisement and put them up for sale?</font>

265
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

266
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I acquired them in the Crystal 
Ruins just yesterday.</font>

267
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From a subterranean dragon of this size?</font>

268
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you had Gil with you. 
I'm not surprised.</font>

269
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that labyrinth's boss was a dragon?</font>

270
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the boss of a hidden room.</font>

271
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? There was still one left 
in that old labyrinth?</font>

272
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I reported it to the guild this morning.</font>

273
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see you understand the 
concept of influence well.</font>

274
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By putting a few scales on the market,</font>

275
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'll show adventurers that the 
subterranean dragon is real.</font>

276
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some people don't trust the 
word of a mere rank F.</font>

277
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who cares if anyone chooses not to 
believe you and gets themselves killed?</font>

278
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That labyrinth is a famous 
tourist spot, isn't it?</font>

279
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never heard of anywhere else where
 you can see the inside of a labyrinth.</font>

280
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:25,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If people went missing there, 
you'd lose a valuable attraction.</font>

281
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How nice of you to worry about that.</font>

282
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Let's get these appraised.</font>

283
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judge, come here!</font>

284
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm almost done getting 
ready, Grandfather!</font>

285
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just for a moment, please.</font>

286
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

287
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You acquired these?</font>

288
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was mostly Gil.</font>

289
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you hurt?</font>

290
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why the change in tone?</font>

291
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, for the scales.</font>

292
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

293
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You make bank like it's nothing.</font>

294
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm lucky to be an adventurer.</font>

295
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up.</font>

296
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I finished packing everything.</font>

297
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The old man made you take
a bunch of gifts, didn't he?</font>

298
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I did.</font>

299
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such as items incompatible with spatial 
magic that you mentioned on the way here?</font>

300
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have some of those.</font>

301
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I managed to acquire them for cheap.</font>

302
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please show me them later.</font>

303
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheap?</font>

304
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the high-quality shop 
you mentioned before.</font>

305
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their business practices 
are a bit questionable.</font>

306
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. They might be pushing it with 
how they acquire some of their items.</font>

307
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But because of that, 
I paid hardly any markup.</font>

308
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a good businessman.</font>

309
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And surprisingly assertive.</font>

310
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He gets the job done.</font>

311
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for accommodating 
my sudden requests.</font>

312
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's for the good of Marcade.</font>

313
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't insolent in the slightest.</font>

314
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lizel.</font>

315
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look after my grandson.</font>

316
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have to. He's a fine merchant.</font>

317
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, I depend on him.</font>

318
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I know.</font>

319
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you next time, Grandfather.</font>

320
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure you don't wanna 
stay another day?</font>

321
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another time.</font>

322
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I take first watch again?</font>

323
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

324
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I bought so many new books.</font>

325
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better actually keep watch.</font>

326
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do my best.</font>

327
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you'd better get some 
proper sleep, too.</font>

328
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

329
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, good night.</font>

330
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

331
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you actually asleep?</font>

332
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

333
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Judge?</font>

334
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's asleep.</font>

335
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope he's sleeping soundly.</font>

336
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to scare him.</font>

337
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're being overprotective.</font>

338
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're using cheap bows.</font>

339
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bandits?</font>

340
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only seen monsters 
use bows in labyrinths.</font>

341
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then they must be human.</font>

342
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Did I miss one?</font>

343
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, he dodged it.</font>

344
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So one of them is skilled.</font>

345
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, he's gone now.</font>

346
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does seem that way.</font>

347
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How does it feel to be used as pawns?</font>

348
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big talk coming from a twink.</font>

349
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you withdraw?</font>

350
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not letting an 
easy mark like you go.</font>

351
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then there's no deal to be made.</font>

352
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll regret catching the 
eye of the Forky Gang!</font>

353
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your boss's name isn't Forky, is it?</font>

354
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eyes on the enemy.</font>

355
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My apologies.</font>

356
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that everyone?</font>

357
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd better move camp.</font>

358
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do it.</font>

359
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's not your watch yet.</font>

360
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you to go 
coddle him all you want.</font>

361
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judge.</font>

362
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for scaring you.</font>

363
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that.</font>

364
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you're safe.</font>

365
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stayed hidden, didn't you? Good boy.</font>

366
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you sleep?</font>

367
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

368
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right. You can 
keep holding my hand.</font>

369
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Close your eyes.</font>

370
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

371
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good night.</font>

372
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he asleep?</font>

373
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Could you handle the rest?</font>

374
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. You should sleep, too.</font>

375
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really coddle them too much.</font>
