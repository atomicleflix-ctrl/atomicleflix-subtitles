1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanted to talk, man to man.</font>

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So talk.</font>

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you and Mizuki-kun
were going out,</font>

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it seems that's not the case.</font>

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured I might as well play along
with your little guardian act.</font>

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't touch him.</font>

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, the way you snatched up
 Mizuki-kun after that fainting spell...</font>

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Made me feel like I should ask permission.</font>

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, you don't mind if I partake, 
do you, Sir Guardian?</font>

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who he goes out with
 is none of my business.</font>

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it can't be you.</font>

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see I'm not liked here.</font>

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if that's how things are,
 let me ask you this.</font>

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you saying that as a guardian?</font>

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or is that your heart talking?</font>

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, hey, Mizuki-kun.</font>

17
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up, Tamami-chan?</font>

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like I'm doing my best here...</font>

19
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trying to be as attractive as possible.</font>

20
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wearing clothes I think guys would like.</font>

21
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... But even then...</font>

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what I do, 
he just won't look at me!</font>

23
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Izumi-sama really <i>that</i> dense?!</font>

24
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, I wouldn't say that...</font>

25
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, so, I was hoping 
to ask your opinion. As a guy.</font>

26
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-Me?</font>

27
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm considering telling 
Izumi-sama how I feel.</font>

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

29
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why are you asking me?</font>

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said it himself.</font>

31
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That you're the only person
 he can be around</font>

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for very long without getting sick of it.</font>

33
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see, I see. Sano said that, did he?</font>

35
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But confessing, huh?</i></font>

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've never even thought about doing it.</i></font>

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Would I have fallen in love with Sano
 normally if I'd met him as a girl?</i></font>

38
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Although if I'd met him as a girl,</i></font>

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>we wouldn't have been able to have
 the relationship we do now.</i></font>

40
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So even if I can't say I love him
 the way Tamami-chan can...</i></font>

41
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="Impact"><font size="22"><font color="#dd3942">Can Things Stay This Way?</font></font></font></font>

42
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder how Sano feels about her.</i></font>

43
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I finished up all the cleaning.</font>

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was thinking of taking a break myself.</font>

45
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great.</font>

46
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perfect timing.</font>

47
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep an eye on her for a bit.</font>

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">K-Kagurazaka!</font>

49
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got a date with a girl 
I picked up yesterday.</font>

50
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care of her.</font>

51
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later!</font>

52
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a terrible brother.</font>

53
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice.</font>

54
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyomi-chan, does that feel good?</font>

55
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever seen this, Kyomi?</font>

57
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You make a water gun with your hands.</font>

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna try?</font>

59
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He likes to complain,</i></font>

61
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but he's actually very caring.</i></font>

62
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing, Kyomi?!</font>

63
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That went up my nose!</font>

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, don't laugh, Mizuki!</font>

65
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, sorry.</font>

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heya, Makita!</font>

67
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey. It's you guys.</font>

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just get back from shopping?</font>

69
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For work, yeah.</font>

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, whatever happened to that girl 
with the long hair from last year?</font>

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dumbass. You know he 
switches out girls every year.</font>

72
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Already kicked her to the curb?</font>

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So dumb.</i></font>

74
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This year's cutie is a cut above, though.</font>

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Already got one in your scope?</font>

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know me.</font>

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The poor girl!</font>

78
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, this guy's only after one thing.</font>

79
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That bastard...</font>

80
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's cold, that's cold!</font>

81
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, you're pretty tough.</font>

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Sano?</font>

84
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You idiot. Have you forgotten
 you just collapsed?</font>

85
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't let yourself get a chill!</font>

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Your shirt's also see-through when wet.</i></font>

87
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the sun's so hot today.</font>

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No excuses!</font>

89
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to get all mad about it!</font>

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, he's right!</font>

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just wrap yourself in the towel already!</font>

92
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gosh, even my underwear got soaked.</font>

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sano was right. 
At this rate, I'll catch a cold.</font>

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sano-kun, are you around?</font>

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A light bulb in the 
second-floor hall needs...</font>

96
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki...kun?</font>

97
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No way!</i></font>

98
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sh-She saw me?!</i></font>

99
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki-kun, you're a....</font>

100
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Io-san, please!</font>

101
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell anyone.</font>

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm begging you!</font>

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First of all, cover yourself up.</font>

104
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't even talk with you like this.</font>

105
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will talk to me, won't you?</font>

106
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

107
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe this.</font>

108
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you chased after Sano-kun 
all the way from America,</font>

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you even lied about your gender?</font>

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised nobody around 
you has figured it out.</font>

111
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not exactly.</font>

112
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He hasn't told anyone, 
but Dr. Umeda knows.</font>

113
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I use a denim vest to bind my chest.</font>

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

115
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's why you
 passed out the other day.</font>

116
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't say I like this.</font>

117
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure your parents are already plenty 
worried about you studying abroad here.</font>

118
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they found out you were at an 
all-boys school, they'd probably faint.</font>

119
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that.</font>

120
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I still want to be with Sano.</font>

121
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing's going to change that!</font>

122
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well said!</font>

123
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What I just said 
was my opinion as a mother.</font>

124
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But speaking as a woman...</font>

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Attagirl!</font>

126
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be the pinnacle of male happiness
 to have a girl go so far for him.</font>

127
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, indeed!</font>

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, so does that mean 
you won't tell anyone?</font>

129
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would never!</font>

130
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if you have any problems,</font>

131
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">come to me and I'll handle them for you!</font>

132
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In an empire of only men, 
a lone flower blooms!</font>

133
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just love it!</font>

134
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a delicious situation!</font>

135
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"If only I could change, then I would!"</font>

136
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the pie-in-the-sky 
dream all girls share.</font>

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right...</i></font>

138
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She </i>is<i> Dr. Umeda's older sister.</i></font>

139
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, Mizuki-kun...</font>

140
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, ma'am?</font>

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must never forget that you're a girl.</font>

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

143
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you put on their clothes 
and adopt their mannerisms,</font>

144
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a girl who sneaks into all-boys 
schools puts herself at risk.</font>

145
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides... things can't stay 
like this forever, can they?</font>

146
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Things can't stay like this?</font>

147
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not.</font>

148
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At some point, your chest will get 
too big to conceal with a vest.</font>

149
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It works for now, but...</font>

150
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plus, you're in love with Sano-kun, right?</font>

151
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that's another reason.</font>

152
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really want things 
to stay as they are?</font>

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sano?</font>

154
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you already asleep?</font>

155
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

156
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, listen...</font>

157
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you say I'm girly?</font>

158
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

159
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Makita say that to you?</font>

160
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

161
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you even bringing him up?</font>

162
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just that... I...</font>

163
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Do you really want things 
to stay as they are?</i></font>

164
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, never mind.</font>

165
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

166
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good night.</font>

167
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know why you're 
overthinking things again.</font>

168
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I know that you're you.</font>

169
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you suddenly started acting like 
Nakatsu, it'd be creepy as hell.</font>

170
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hell'd you just say?</font>

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ya wanna beat-down, dumbass?!</font>

172
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you get it, then go to sleep already.</font>

173
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've got another early day tomorrow.</font>

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But you know, Sano...</i></font>

176
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought I was fine 
with things the way they are.</i></font>

177
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As long as it means I can be with you.</i></font>

178
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But what if things can't 
stay like this anymore?</i></font>

179
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't know what I should do.</i></font>

180
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I really don't care,</font>

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but why the hell do we have
 to shell beans with these guys?</font>

182
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How should I know?</font>

183
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, Kagurazaka...</font>

184
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened on your hot date 
with that girl you picked up?</font>

185
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, don't bring that up.</font>

186
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She dumped him.</font>

187
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tamami!</font>

188
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lookin' good, Kyomi.</font>

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a real big help.</font>

190
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

191
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, he's right.</font>

192
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're doing a great job.</font>

193
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? I'll help too!</font>

194
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you really afford 
to be so chill, Sano?</font>

195
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?</font>

196
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That creep Makita just 
drove off with Ashiya.</font>

197
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And?</font>

198
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shouldn't you be worried?</font>

199
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone takes the car to go shopping.</font>

200
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

201
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess you better just pray nothing 
happens in the privacy of that car.</font>

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's taking Makita and Mizuki so long?</font>

203
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to start preparing dinner soon.</font>

204
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, they called earlier.</font>

205
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like the engine stalled.</font>

206
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said they'd be 
about an hour or two late.</font>

207
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Izumi?</font>

208
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me that Makita-kun's...</font>

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong, Makita-san?</font>

210
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's about Sano-kun.</font>

211
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sano?</font>

212
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems to me like you 
have feelings for him,</font>

213
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I think he only sees you as a friend.</font>

214
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that!</font>

215
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should switch to me.</font>

216
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't ever leave you feeling bad.</font>

217
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Don't tell me he still sees me as a girl.</i></font>

218
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Uh, Makita-san...</font>

219
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like you.</font>

220
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All this time, I couldn't 
get you out of my head.</font>

221
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not so fast.</font>

223
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Makita-san!</font>

224
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish you'd quit being such 
a little girl about this,</font>

225
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki-chan.</font>

226
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

227
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ashiya?</font>

228
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?!</font>

229
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ashiya!</font>

230
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

231
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm scared!</font>

232
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,770

233
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry!</font>

234
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're safe now!</font>

235
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here.</font>

236
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're okay.</font>

237
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're safe now.</font>

238
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sun's completely set.</font>

 I slipped and we fell down here.</font>

248
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,660

261
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,920

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you, didn't I?</font>

275
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care about your love life,</font>

276
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but what are you doing indiscriminately
going after a teenage boy?</font>

277
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What? A boy?</font>

278
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right!</font>

279
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Looks like he didn't get far...</i></font>

280
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know that Mizuki and his friends 
all go to a proper boys' school, right?</font>

281
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are they, anyway?</font>

282
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, they're not back yet?</font>

283
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The moss is too slippery 
everywhere to get up.</font>

284
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not like you could climb with your ankle.</font>

285
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll just have to wait here for rescue.</font>

286
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

287
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't say it to make you feel bad.</font>

288
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nakatsu and Io-san must
be worried about us.</font>

289
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, probably.</font>

290
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I got you mixed up 
in this weirdness.</font>

291
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you still going on about tha—</font>

292
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was... really scared.</font>

293
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I think about what would've 
happened if you hadn't come to save me...</font>

294
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's weird, right?</font>

295
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A guy being so unmanly about this...</font>

296
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, almost being assaulted as a guy
is pathetic to begin with.</font>

297
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're safe now.</font>

298
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

299
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The warmth you give off feels nice.</font>

300
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you're running a fever.</font>

301
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that's not funny.
 I wasn't making a joke.</font>

302
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I didn't mean it like that.</font>

303
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it.</font>

304
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have a fever.</font>

305
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

306
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't even notice.</font>

307
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're tired, you can lean on me.</font>

308
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Sorry.</font>

309
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously!</font>

310
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, sor—</font>

311
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least let me help you
at a time like this.</font>

312
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that I can do much more 
than lend you a shoulder.</font>

313
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's enough.</font>

314
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

315
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're really late.</font>

316
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just wait until morning.</font>

317
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they're not back by then,</font>

318
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll request a search party.</font>

319
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have time for that!</font>

320
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Io-san, can you get the car?</font>

321
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going out right now!</font>

322
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

323
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, your arm's nice and reassuring.</font>

324
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to climb up somehow 
and call for help after all.</font>

325
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just stay put right here.</font>

326
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be right back.</font>

327
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

328
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't go!</font>

329
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't go...</font>

330
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay with me.</font>

331
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it.</font>

332
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I do?</font>

333
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder... What's that sound?</i></font>

334
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's so soothing.</i></font>

335
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll always stay with you.</font>

336
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, Yujiro?!</font>

337
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you are!</font>

338
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Mizuki! Izumi!</font>

339
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Took you freakin' long enough.</font>

340
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right?</font>

341
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It just hurts a little bit.</font>

342
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

343
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like your fever has gone down too.</font>

344
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Makita-san still...</font>

345
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He left this morning.</font>

346
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

347
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're well enough, why don't you 
go reassure those worried idiots?</font>

348
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially Sano-kun.</font>

349
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He held you so protectively
after you came down with that fever.</font>

350
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that, take the day to rest.</font>

351
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So Sano holding me actually happened?</i></font>

352
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But the kiss... That was just a 
conveniently nice dream, right?</i></font>

353
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you well enough to be up already?</font>

354
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Sano. Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

355
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? That's good.</font>

356
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going home tomorrow, so get ready.</font>

357
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sano!</font>

358
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

359
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... th-thanks for yesterday!</font>

360
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sure.</font>

361
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I've still got some work to do.</font>

362
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, okay.</font>

363
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Break a leg.</font>

364
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It wasn't a dream. Probably.</i></font>

365
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mizuki!</font>

366
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all better now?</font>

367
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

368
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for all the trouble.</font>

369
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though it wasn't for long,</font>

370
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">having you here was a huge help.</font>

371
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

372
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

373
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kagurazaka?</font>

374
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a relief I don't have to see 
your stupid faces anymore after today.</font>

375
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say something, Kagupi?</font>

376
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do <i>not</i> call me that!</font>

379
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beats me.</font>

380
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,340
