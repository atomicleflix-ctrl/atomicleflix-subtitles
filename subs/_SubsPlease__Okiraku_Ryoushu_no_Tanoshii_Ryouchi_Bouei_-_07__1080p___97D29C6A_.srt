00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad we beat that forest dragon
 without any losses.</font>

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those ramparts you made
 served their purpose.</font>

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true. Without them, 
it might've been a different story.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a proposal, Lord Van.</font>

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that you've made
those sturdy ramparts,</font>

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">why not turn your attention
to city planning next?</font>

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">City planning?</font>

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mentioned before that I should aim
 to build a city for 10,000 to live in.</font>

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To accomplish that and fashion an 
attractive city, we'll need new residents.</font>

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bell and Rango have returned with folk
 from the Mary Chamber of Commerce.</font>

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said they'd buy the materials
 from the forest dragon.</font>

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great.</font>

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, we'll sell the dragon materials.</font>

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'll make a city

23
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A large forest dragon at that.</font>

24
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Its scales, claws, fangs, and eyes

32
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,150

38
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given the current market, 
I'd say about 60 platinum.</font>

44
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,910

45
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's crazy.</font>

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,950

56
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even so...</font>

57
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We brothers aim to do things fairly,</font>

60
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And with Lord Van,

67
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,730

68
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, hey...</font>

69
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not found your own trading company?</font>

70
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

71
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You make it sound easy.</font>

72
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-Is it difficult?</font>

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to fulfill three conditions 
to establish a trading company.</font>

74
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, pay the Merchants' Guild
 registration fee.</font>

75
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}1. PAY THE MERCHANT GUILD'S REGISTRATION FEE</font>

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Second, own your own shop.</font>

77
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}2. OWN A PHYSICAL SHOP</font>

78
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And third, get an endorsement
 from a titled noble.</font>

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}3. ENDORSEMENT FROM A TITLED NOBLE</font>

80
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The first two are easy enough,
 but that last one's an issue.</i></font>

81
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The only person with a title 
who's likely to help us is...</i></font>

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, I don't mind.</font>

83
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You'll do it?</font>

84
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear the Mary Chamber of Commerce 
is favored by the royal family.</font>

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't they harass you?</font>

86
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think about it.</font>

87
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I found a small trading company
 as a newly elevated noble,</font>

88
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">recognizing it is no skin off their noses.</font>

89
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, it'd be a bad look 
for the royal family if they didn't.</font>

90
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I have no land 
or knights of my own,</font>

92
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so if I want to climb the ladder,</font>

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to do things
 that will get people talking.</font>

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I do this, word will spread that
I helped two earnest merchants.</font>

95
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, why not say 
<i>you</i> defeated that dragon, Panamera?</font>

96
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People will talk about that, 
and it means my family won't find out.</font>

97
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your thought process 
has the oddest blind spots.</font>

98
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dragons are rarely slain.</font>

99
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if I said I'd killed it, they'd want
 to know in detail how I'd managed it,</font>

100
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and their own investigations 
would lead to you anyway.</font>

101
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will I do if my family
 summons me home?</font>

102
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's one way to avoid that.</font>

103
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

104
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's simple. Get yourself a title.</font>

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A title?</font>

106
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All nobles have a title.</font>

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}DUKE | MARQUIS | COUNT | VISCOUNT
 BARON | BARONET | KNIGHT</font>

108
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've worked my way up 
from knight, the lowest title,</font>

109
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but since you're the son of a marquis,</font>

110
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'd probably make you
 a baron to start with.</font>

111
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, get yourself a title 
and found a new house.</font>

112
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What is this woman saying?</i></font>

113
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just need to declare
that you slew the dragon.</font>

114
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I really did was pin it down.</font>

115
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way. That would make me 
<i>really</i> stand out, wouldn't it?</font>

116
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that dissatisfies you?</font>

117
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can become famous for being 
the eight-year-old who slew a dragon,</font>

118
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and use that achievement
 to earn a title.</font>

119
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said...</font>

120
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do understand how you feel, young man.</font>

121
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I first earned my title,
 I gained more enemies,</font>

122
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and people trying to use me
 came out of the woodwork.</font>

123
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

124
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I reduced all of them to ash.</font>

125
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To ash?</font>

126
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So if any new enemies show up, don't 
hesitate to fire your ballistae at them.</font>

127
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dozen corpses in your wake

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Young man.</font>

132
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you worried about me?</font>

133
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think I've done anything to have
 an-eight-year old worrying about me,</font>

134
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so perhaps I misheard.</font>

135
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I didn't mean it.</font>

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In fact, I'm now worried 
about my own safety.</font>

137
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't eat me.</font>

138
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always have an amusing retort.</font>

139
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I won't eat you
 for another five years.</font>

140
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So to help you grow even bigger,</font>

141
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let you take the glory 
for slaying this dragon.</font>

142
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't believe it.</i></font>

143
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I apparently only have 
five years left to live.</i></font>

144
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?! Lady Panamera?!</font>

145
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'll endorse us?!</font>

146
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That means...</font>

147
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. You can found your own 
trading company, Bell and Rango.</font>

148
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

149
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting down to it, will you please 
sell those dragon materials to us?</font>

150
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

151
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We want to repay you for all you've done 
for us, so how does 130 platinum sound?</font>

152
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That much?</font>

153
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks. We have a deal.</font>

154
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

155
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, let's go to the royal capital
 to sell all this stuff.</font>

156
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There aren't any carriages?</font>

157
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. The Mary Chamber of Commerce
 merchants just left with it.</font>

158
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What were they thinking?</font>

159
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're waiting for you 
to come crying to them.</font>

160
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't transport the goods, 
you have no choice but to listen to them.</font>

161
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I'll make a new
 carriage for you two.</font>

162
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will?</font>

163
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, you can have
 my warhorse to pull the carriage.</font>

164
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're well-trained, and their stamina 
and speed are on another level.</font>

165
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet Bell and Rango are 
regretting their decision now.</font>

166
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those foolish brothers.</font>

167
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll come crying to us in no time.</font>

168
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What's that?</font>

169
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Viscountess Cayenne?</font>

170
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was Bell and Rango, wasn't it?</font>

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why were they with the viscountess?</font>

172
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hold on a sec...</font>

173
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With the cooperation of a noble, they 
could start their own trading company!</font>

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way!</font>

175
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}KINGDOM OF SCUDERIA
ROYAL CAPITAL, AUDIENCE CHAMBER</font>

176
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the social climber is here again.</font>

177
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I assumed you had come 
to petition me for a higher rank.</font>

178
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet you want me to grant
 a title to someone else?</font>

179
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's correct...</font>

180
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">King Dino.</font>

181
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}KINGDOM OF SCUDERIA'S KING
DINO EN TSORA BELLRINET</font>

182
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Viscountess Cayenne, I do not see
 this man you seek a title for.</font>

183
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man in question is the lord
 of a remote village.</font>

184
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's currently safeguarding his village, 
so he couldn't make it to the royal capital.</font>

185
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you recommend 
such a man to the nobility?</font>

186
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For his great deeds so far, 
and his potential that overshadows them.</font>

187
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

188
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given your prowess, for you to recommend him 
means I can expect great things, yes?</font>

189
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, what manner of feats could 
he have achieved in a village so remote,</font>

190
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we haven't stationed troops
 or knights there?</font>

191
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He slew a forest dragon.</font>

192
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Is that even possible?</font>

193
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he "slew" it? He didn't drive it off?</font>

194
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this lord an elemental mage?</font>

195
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, his magical aptitude 
is for production magic.</font>

196
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Production</i> magic?</font>

197
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is this man?</font>

198
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The son of Marquis Fertio,</font>

199
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Van Nei Fertio.</font>

200
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lord who is barely eight years old.</font>

201
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? An eight year old child 
in charge of a remote village?</font>

202
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me more details.</font>

203
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will. The moment that young boy arrived 
in the village he was to rule over,</font>

204
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he found it under attack by bandits.</font>

205
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, he protected the village
 and killed the bandits</font>

206
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with the few subordinates 
and adventurers escorting him.</font>

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aha. So he joined battle 
and triumphed at such a young age?</font>

208
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that, the young boy 
used his production magic</font>

209
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to surround the village 
with walls, put in a moat,</font>

210
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">rebuild the ramshackle homes, 
and improve the village's defenses.</font>

211
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, this dragon attacked that village?</font>

212
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

213
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assisted in the slaying of the dragon,
 but all I did was pin it down.</font>

214
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van and his subordinates 
used their strength</font>

215
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to slay it without suffering 
a single casualty.</font>

216
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds hard to believe.</font>

217
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a fang from the slain dragon.</font>

218
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love for you to 
come see, Your Majesty.</font>

219
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To see how much this village has changed 
in its short time under Van's stewardship.</font>

220
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure a man as wise as Your Majesty
 would make him the lord</font>

221
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">of a territory even greater in size 
for the sake of our nation's defense.</font>

222
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting.</font>

223
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Van Nei Fertio, huh? I would like
 to meet him as soon as possible.</font>

224
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let it be known that 
Van Nei Fertio slew a dragon!</font>

225
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To honor this achievement,</font>

226
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he has been made a baron!</font>

227
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Marquis Fertio's son.</font>

228
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fourth son they called a prodigy?</font>

229
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A child slew a dragon?</font>

230
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, young man, 
things are about to get interesting.</font>

231
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better be grateful.</font>

232
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After Panamera and 
the others left the village,</i></font>

233
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I remade the uniform houses
 into something fancier,</i></font>

234
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>then reconstructed the village center.</i></font>

235
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All in all, my city building 
was proceeding smoothly.</i></font>

236
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then, in addition to that...</i></font>

237
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I built some towers.</i></font>

238
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're incredibly tall.</font>

239
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you've made two of them.</font>

240
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

241
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one's Oligo Tower, and the one
on the other side is Grape Tower.</font>

242
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Towers serve as symbols of a settlement 
and allow us to detect enemies from afar,</font>

243
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so this has also fortified our defenses.</font>

244
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone in the village can 
now enjoy their lives in peace.</font>

245
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, I'll prepare 
your lunch immediately.</font>

246
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey. Why don't we go eat lunch 
at the top of the tower?</font>

247
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's dig in.</font>

248
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Till, your homemade egg
 sandwiches are delicious.</font>

249
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you like them.</font>

250
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, they're not bad.</font>

251
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The view from the top
 of this tower is great, too.</font>

252
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that we have 
proper buildings and facilities,</font>

253
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it might be time to start 
officially calling this a town.</font>

254
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, it was Van Village,</font>

255
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and now, I bet you're planning to call it 
something silly like Van Town, aren't you?</font>

256
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong with that?
 I think Van Town would be a lovely name.</font>

257
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would be fitting.</font>

258
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Van Town does have a nice ring to it.</font>

259
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously, I'm ending this conversation
before you actually start calling it that.</font>

260
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone just says whatever they want.</font>

261
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Lady Arte?</font>

262
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, yes.</font>

263
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, Lord Van?</font>

264
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

265
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-If you don't mind, could you 
just call me Arte from now on?</font>

266
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Are you sure?</font>

267
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes. I think that will make it easier
 for you to speak to me.</font>

268
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. "Arte" it is.</font>

269
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even though she asked me to say that,
she looks embarrassed.</i></font>

270
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, everyone.</font>

271
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would we all like some post-meal dessert?</font>

272
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dessert?</font>

273
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da!</font>

274
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

275
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cake!</font>

276
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you make this, Till?</font>

277
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

278
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But how?</font>

279
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After Bell and Rango 
set up shop in the village,</font>

280
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was able to get all the ingredients 
I needed to make a cake.</font>

281
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, really?</font>

282
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man.</font>

283
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This might be turning 
into a pretty nice village.</font>

284
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's delicious.</font>

285
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So delish.</font>

287
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's sweet.</font>

288
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You're not having any, Till?</font>

289
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got a bit <i>too</i> into baking cakes lately,
 so I've been eating cake every day.</font>

290
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And my weight is in a perilous situation.</font>

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I see.</font>

292
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

293
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter, Khamsin?</font>

294
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, look over there.</font>

295
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't look like
 soldiers or adventurers.</font>

296
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder who they are.</font>

297
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, is this village Seatoh?</font>

298
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seatoh?</font>

299
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear a people called the Seatoh lived on 
this land before there was a village here.</font>

300
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a result, many refer 
to this village as Seatoh.</font>

301
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So this village </i>did<i> have a name all along?</i></font>

302
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, it's really true.</font>

303
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's changed so drastically,
I still find it hard to believe.</font>

304
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what brings you here?</font>

305
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've come from the neighboring village.</font>

306
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are taxed heavily but we have
 few young people to do the work.</font>

307
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can hardly make ends meet.</font>

308
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we came here to talk it over
 with the folk in Seatoh.</font>

309
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you have few young people?</font>

310
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our young ones didn't choose
 to leave the village.</font>

311
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:33,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were taken by the count to bolster
 his forces in preparation for war.</font>

312
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, so they're from a village 
in Ferdinatto County?</i></font>

313
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I really shouldn't be welcoming 
in people from another domain,</i></font>

314
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I'm fairly sure these people 
risked their lives to make it this far.</i></font>

315
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, what would you say 
to relocating here?</font>

316
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You mean you'd take us in?</font>

317
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But none of us have any money.</font>

318
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't be an issue if you don't
 have to pay taxes for a while.</font>

319
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have food, and I can 
prepare homes for you.</font>

320
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-Is this heaven?</font>

321
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many villagers are there in total?</font>

322
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only ten of us made the trip today, 
but our village's population is about 300.</font>

323
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be all right 
with one house per family?</font>

324
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe it. 
This sounds like a dream.</font>

325
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll get a few adventurers to go
 with you to escort all the villagers here.</font>

326
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it really all right for us 
to accept such kindness?</font>

327
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll also lend you some carriages
 to help with your belongings.</font>

328
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that won't be necessary. 
We have cows, so they can carry all that.</font>

329
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cows? You have cows? <i>Dairy</i> cows?</font>

330
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The county has rich pastures, 
so we have ten cows.</font>

331
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wow. Cows, cows, cows!</i></font>

332
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They produce milk. We can make
 cheese, butter, and so on.</i></font>

333
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This could be the village's
 major new industry.</i></font>

334
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right!</font>

335
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, Lord Van sure is generous.</font>

336
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's taking in 300 people, just like that.</font>

337
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Plus, the reward for this quest
 is way too generous.</font>

338
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you two.</font>

339
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're almost there, so keep a sharp eye
 on our surroundings, will you?</font>

340
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Last time, you two were
so absorbed in idle chitchat,</font>

341
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we were attacked by 
that forest dragon. Remember?</font>

342
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but that...</font>

343
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wasn't <i>our</i> fault.</font>

344
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No talking back!</font>

345
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on now! Back to your posts!</font>

346
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, ma'am.</font>

347
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

348
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, thank you.</font>

349
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're almost there. Hang in there.</font>

350
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I was against this.</font>

351
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going from the middle of nowhere
to somewhere even more remote.</font>

352
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true.</font>

353
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are heading to a more remote village.</font>

354
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this particular 
remote village is paradise.</font>

355
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome to Seatoh.</font>

356
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you're all worn out 
from your journey,</font>

357
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so fill up on barbecued meat,</font>

358
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then get a good night's rest 
in the homes I've prepared for you.</font>

359
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, i-is it really okay to eat it?</font>

360
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. Go eat your fill.</font>

361
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Till?</font>

362
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me.</font>

363
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on. Over here.</font>

364
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, help yourselves.</font>

365
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's so much meat.</font>

366
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it really okay to eat this?</font>

367
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's delicious.</font>

368
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yum!</font>

369
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so good.</font>

370
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was hard work preparing homes 
and a barbecue for 300 people,</i></font>

371
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but it was well worth the effort.</i></font>

372
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, my lord?</font>

373
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there, um, any work for us to do?</font>

374
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Work?</font>

375
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We want a way to earn a living.</font>

376
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of us have any savings.</font>

377
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, right. Everyone's
 wracked with anxiety.</i></font>

378
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

379
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, could I ask you to help run 
the inn or the new shops we're opening?</font>

380
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll also need people to help 
cultivate some new fields.</font>

381
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can handle the fields, 
but we've never run businesses before.</font>

382
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be fine.</font>

383
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can leave calculating the money
to those who can do it,</font>

384
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so all you have to focus on 
is what you're capable of.</font>

385
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever since Lord Van came,</font>

386
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">life in this village has improved so much,
 you'd hardly recognize it.</font>

387
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we'll all do everything we can to 
help you enjoy your lives here as well.</font>

388
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this really all right, though?
 You're doing so much for us.</font>

389
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Till, I think it's about time.</font>

390
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

391
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

392
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are those?</font>

395
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I asked your village chief to lend us some
 of your cows' milk to make fresh cream.</font>

396
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soon enough, we'll have 
a trading company in this village.</font>

401
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,140

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too.</font>

405
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,890
