5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of it.</font>

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember.</font>

9
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... what am I supposed to do?</font>

10
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, pardon me, but I smell

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's with me?!</font>

14
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all awful!</font>

15
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you be so rude?</font>

16
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ought to kick them out immediately!</font>

17
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you should do that right now.</font>

18
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

19
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your dream is to grant everyone's 
dreams, right, Fushi?</font>

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And for that to happen, 
the world has to be peaceful.</font>

21
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured out what peace is.</font>

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you done something?</font>

23
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Fushi-kun, did you just get here?</font>

24
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's already lunch.</font>

26
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you look pale.</font>

27
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all right?</font>

28
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh, he's here.</i></font>

29
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We are holding a special assembly.</i></font>

30
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,310

31
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">please gather at the gymnasium immediately.</font>

32
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I doing here?</font>

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun?</font>

34
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun.</font>

35
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing up there?</font>

36
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's an assembly about to start.</font>

37
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Fushi-kun.</font>

38
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd you dye your hair back?</font>

39
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun?</font>

40
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi, you have no idea 
what we've been through.</font>

41
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you done with Yuki's thing?</font>

42
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come.</font>

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha... Tonari-san?</font>

45
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait!</font>

46
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move.</font>

47
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, got a problem?</font>

48
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, let's not do this anymore.</font>

49
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you're the last ones here!</font>

50
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, we'll be right there.</font>

51
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's cold!</font>

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the?!</font>

53
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Water?!</font>

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps the sprinklers are malfunctioning.</font>

55
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, get outside!</font>

56
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell?</font>

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My feet are soaked!</font>

58
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have a towel?</font>

59
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tonari-san?</font>

60
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hit him!</font>

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun!</font>

62
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move! You there!</font>

63
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm firing again!</font>

64
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think you're doing, Tonari-san?!</font>

65
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it!</font>

66
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That isn't him!</font>

67
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That isn't Fushi!</font>

68
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up and run!</font>

69
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tanasen!</font>

70
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tanacchi!</font>

71
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's happening?</font>

72
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

73
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi...</font>

74
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What have you done?</font>

75
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have realized by now.</font>

76
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humanity doesn't need the 
Nokkers to be unhappy.</font>

77
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the curse of having flesh.</font>

78
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been making up for 
the imperfectness of flesh.</font>

79
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So far, we've only worked on those 
who were suffering misfortune.</font>

80
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I just realized...</font>

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The environment is a problem, too.</font>

82
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember what you said?</font>

83
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That you wanted to make a place of happiness?</font>

84
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the same thing.</font>

85
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't have a better world 
unless the surroundings change.</font>

86
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I figured I'd try it out.</font>

87
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, at school.</font>

88
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And?</font>

89
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has something happened at school?!</font>

90
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you do something?!</font>

91
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm assuming you need this.</font>

92
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't let you have it, though.</font>

93
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So many Nokkers!</font>

94
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cages?</font>

95
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're trapped!</font>

96
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow...</font>

97
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like they're real enemies.</font>

98
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vice Principal, it's all slimy!</font>

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha-senpai!</font>

100
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you do this?!</font>

101
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me! May I post this online later?</font>

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My smartphone!</font>

103
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They'll die if I'm not 
careful with how I act.</i></font>

104
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that... school?</font>

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me! I'd like to get online. 
What's the Wi-Fi pass—</font>

106
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My laptop!</font>

107
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

108
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that?</font>

109
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks just like Fushi!</font>

110
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tonari-san?!</font>

111
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, dear.</font>

112
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like there's a straggler.</font>

113
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no! Oh, no! What do we do?</font>

114
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The police? Ambulance?</font>

115
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's this stagnant water smell?</i></font>

116
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I just noticed something...</font>

117
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're the only ones who 
never got hit by that water.</font>

118
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's it! The water!</font>

119
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't touch the water!</font>

120
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already touched Tanasen!</font>

121
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't changed yet. I think we're safe.</font>

122
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, this way!</font>

123
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, go!</font>

124
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, what about you?</font>

125
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be a decoy.</font>

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously? You're going to fight it?</font>

127
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. We can't let that thing 
get out into the town!</font>

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm taking it down at school!</font>

129
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go, Ligard!</font>

130
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're in trouble now.</font>

131
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't allowed to bring

132
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that thing that looks just like me?</font>

133
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I raised Nokkers inside your corpse.</font>

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really small ones.</font>

135
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,850

139
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doll will keep going until it 
turns all the students into its pawns.</font>

140
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,560

141
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let one of you free.</font>

142
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're going to kill everyone?</font>

143
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what everyone 
meant to you until now, Mizuha,</font>

144
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if you don't value life...</font>

145
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

146
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way you <i>really</i> want to do this.</font>

147
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you're enjoying good crêpes,</font>

148
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when you smile when your mom praises you...</font>

149
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's when you're the real Mizuha!</font>

150
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you think I might 
let you go if you cried?</font>

151
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I ask something?</font>

152
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll all be free if Ms. Tonari 
defeats that Fushi doll, correct?</font>

153
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What if the others manage 
to flee from school?</font>

154
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't be possible.</font>

155
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't let it hit me!</i></font>

156
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I gotta regroup.</i></font>

157
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way! Follow me!</font>

158
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What the hell are those things?</i></font>

159
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I have to hurry!</i></font>

160
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are you going?</font>

161
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to the staff's office to 
call for help and then to Tonari-san.</font>

162
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll leave it to you to 
decide what to do here.</font>

163
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye.</font>

164
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, what are we supposed to do?</font>

165
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, look at this.</font>

166
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun?!</font>

167
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And a bunch of swords and 
stuff for some reason.</font>

168
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, Fushi-kun, get up!</font>

169
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is going on?</font>

170
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help us out!</font>

171
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going over there.</font>

172
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Over there? Where?</font>

173
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't mean...</font>

174
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That Tonari girl's fighting all on her own.</font>

175
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get the sense we should be helping her.</font>

176
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait, I can't!</font>

177
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going home.</font>

178
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, we should call our 
families and evacuate.</font>

179
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I'll stay, too.</font>

180
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?! Let's go home!</font>

181
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm not going.</font>

182
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what I want.</font>

183
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's reckless!</font>

184
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't stand a chance!</font>

185
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're just helpless bystanders. 
We need to run!</font>

186
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take you home kicking 
and screaming if I have to!</font>

187
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so heavy.</font>

188
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe we can use these.</font>

189
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tanasen...</font>

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fighting already?</font>

191
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Screwed whether they stay or flee.</font>

192
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Screwed without the Nokkers 
having to do anything.</font>

193
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels great making 
your ideals come to life.</font>

194
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so happy right now.</font>

195
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ought to be more selfish, too.</font>

196
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't have to try to look 
cool around your friends.</font>

197
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should have just made them spoil you.</font>

198
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could have taken out 
that meat doll that way.</font>

199
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All you can do now is 
watch them get taken down.</font>

200
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Fushi?</font>

201
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No fair, Dad!</font>

202
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you go back to Paradise without us?</font>

203
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Mom?</font>

204
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itsuki-san...</font>

205
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mom?</font>

206
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, get in, now!</font>

207
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">President, this way!</font>

208
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

209
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Itsuki-san!</font>

210
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

211
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, Mom?!</font>

212
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love him!</font>

213
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We aren't running.</font>

214
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, hold our hands.</font>

215
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>One, two,</i></font>

216
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>three, four,</i></font>

217
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>five,</i></font>

218
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>six.</i></font>

219
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Six seconds for it to recover.</i></font>

220
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't have many more Janandan arrows left.</i></font>

221
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's no point in just slowing him down.</i></font>

222
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What do I do?</i></font>

223
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't dodge his attacks 
in this straight hallway!</i></font>

224
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aiko-chan?!</font>

225
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought arrows and a raincoat!</font>

226
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you know I was here?</font>

227
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made a guess based on what's 
on the security cameras.</font>

228
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what do we do?</font>

229
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't look like we can 
defeat it with your arrows.</font>

230
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, they aren't doing anything.</font>

231
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to keep it burning.</font>

232
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way!</font>

233
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run, run!</font>

234
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jump!</font>

235
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have a taste...</font>

236
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...of this!</font>

237
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run!</font>

238
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

239
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teamwork wins the day!</font>

240
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Fire. Fire.</i></font>

241
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Fire. Fire.</i></font>

242
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like we aren't done yet.</font>

243
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

244
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can defeat it again.</font>

245
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No more!</font>

246
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should have just run!</font>

247
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have time for this!</font>

248
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just tell me how we won't have to die!</font>

249
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Six arrows will work better than one.</font>

250
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, give me your right hand!</font>

251
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go home together, Mizuha-senpai!</font>

252
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

253
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let's return home, Mizuha.</font>

254
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome home.</font>

255
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back.</font>

256
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back, Mizuha.</font>

257
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did well.</font>

258
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to stay here?</font>

259
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's be friends in your next life.</font>

260
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi!</font>

261
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha!</font>

262
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave that body behind.</font>

263
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. You must be the 
Nokker inside her father.</font>

264
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This human was weak of spirit.</font>

265
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He couldn't tolerate the sight 
of his daughter changing.</font>

266
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems Izumi-san's Nokker will be 
waiting for her blood to dry and wither.</font>

267
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will you do?</font>

268
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we all go home first?</font>

269
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi!</font>

270
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you?!</font>

271
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi!</font>

272
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha!</font>

273
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess that won't work.</font>

274
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chami, ammo!</font>

275
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir!</font>

276
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuki...</font>

277
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll trust you.</font>

278
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take Mizuha to the hospital, quick!</font>

279
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi, we'll take care of her.</font>

280
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move.</font>

281
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi!</font>

282
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Guardians need the body.</font>

283
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough!</font>

284
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not point a gun at a child!</font>

285
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go!</font>

286
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, run!</font>

287
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't let them escape!</font>

288
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop them, Chami!</font>

289
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay back!</font>

290
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow the team's muscle to handle it!</font>

291
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice, Fushi!</font>

292
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rope!</font>

293
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cut the rope!</font>

294
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

295
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go.</font>

296
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The elevator won't move!</font>

297
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a big one!</font>

298
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Open the door, Fushi!</font>

299
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's open!</font>

300
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

301
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Out of my way.</font>

302
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get in! Quick!</font>

303
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vice President, we need to deal with this!</font>

304
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun, can you move the elevator?</font>

305
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang in there!</font>

306
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about this?!</font>

307
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You weakened it!</font>

308
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you throw at it?</font>

309
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd prepared Holy Salt for 
this kind of occasion.</font>

310
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's odd...</font>

311
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It said in the books that the 
Nokkers were in sea water.</font>

312
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean holy power 
really worked on it?</font>

313
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps the sodium in the water wasn't of 
a high enough concentration to hurt it.</font>

314
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Fushi!</font>

315
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right! It worked!</font>

316
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't remember the way.</font>

317
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No problem. Fushi will tell us.</font>

318
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at all those creepy flowers...</font>

319
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't get out anymore!</font>

320
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to defeat that thing first.</font>

321
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But how?!</font>

322
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fires get put out right away.</font>

323
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire... Water...</font>

324
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way, guys!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Whatever.</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No matter what's happening elsewhere,
