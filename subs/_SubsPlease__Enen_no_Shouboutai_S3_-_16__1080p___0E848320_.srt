5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The preface to the Great Cataclysm ends here.</font>

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Great Cataclysm consists of this

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is the process of unifying

for destruction, don't they?</font>

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means the destruction of the world.</font>

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which is why we must guide humanity's 
collective unconscious in the proper direction.</font>

12

humanity's imaginings is death.</font>

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We cannot permit the correct image 
of death to waver in the slightest.</font>

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Haumea, how is the collective unconscious?</font>

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No problems. The final ending is death!</font>

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,670

18

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though the scale of the sequences 
is different, they are the same.</font>

20

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This planet—this universe—are thus, as well.</font>

21
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the eighth one.</font>

22
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's happening to this world?</font>

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another Titan's gonna 
appear! We've gotta run!</font>

24

28

29
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is the final pillar.</font>

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The 2nd and Haijima are 
in charge of the Titan!</font>

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll evacuate the civilians!</font>

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

Stop complaining and just do it.</font>

39
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back with the first one, it was shocking 
just seeing a giant pillar appear,</font>

40
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but now, look at that.</font>

41
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To ensure that the Cataclysm 
proceeds smoothly,</font>

42
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,390

44

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Special Fire Force Company 8, move out!</font>

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a Titan!</font>

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry! I let my guard down!</font>

52
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,410

as if it works as an excuse.</font>

53
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Letting your guard down
in itself is a bad thing!</font>

54
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I apologized!</font>

55
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll stop these Infernals!</font>

136
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is divine punishment!</font>

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please forgive us, Raffles-sama!</font>

00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can stand, right?</font>

142
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just a scratch. Come on. Get up!</font>

Infernal at a crucial time like this?</font>

144
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was useless right up to the end!</font>

161
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra!</font>

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this really the time for that?! 
We're in an emergency here!</font>

168
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you plotting? 
Don't act without orders!</font>

169
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra-kun, I'll back you up!</font>

170
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can handle this alone!</font>

171
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Adolla's closer, so my ignition

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra, don't worry about things here! Go!</font>

176
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we get hit like this, 
we'll all get wiped out.</font>

177
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karin!</font>

178
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,990

before the next bombardment!</font>

183
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give it a try!</font>

184

185
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,600

Karin, you're amazing, too!</font>

186
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I am!</font>

187
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show 'em the spirit of the 4th!</font>

191
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does the 4th do?</font>

192
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We never abandon anyone and 
we protect the survivors!</font>

193
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't expect it from Karin, 
but that's pretty good!</font>

271
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It could result in serious casualties!</font>

272
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if that's true...</font>

276
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, I beg you to grant it.</font>

277
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

278
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it Iris?</font>

279
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this light?</font>

280
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain Pan, is this a buff?</font>

281
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I haven't done a thing.</font>

282
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

283
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brother!</font>

284
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the light of an Adolla Burst!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sister has awakened 
with the eighth pillar?</font>

287
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brother, it seems you don't have 
to worry about the shockwave.</font>

288
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having the sister's devotion

290

294
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A savior...</font>

295

296
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra-kun's styling has changed!</font>

297
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he's finally overcome the devil, has he?</font>

298
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My big brother is a real hero!</font>

299
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hero...</font>

301
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go, Shinra!</font>

302
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra-kun, you can do it!</font>

303
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra!</font>

304
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go get 'em, Shinra!</font>

305
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go! You can do it!</font>

306
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? It can't be...</font>

307
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here I go!</font>

308
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here comes the shockwave!</font>

309
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Látom.</font>

310
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was amazing, Shinra!</font>

311
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was insane.</font>

312
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

313
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are a hero!</font>

314
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He did it, Lieutenant!</font>

315
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

316
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain, it was over in an instant!</font>

317
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, hero!</font>

318
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly. He's grown far too strong.</font>

319
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredible. That fire soldier...</font>

320
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

321
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it isn't true.</font>

322
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Raffles-sama!</font>

323
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That fire soldier... What has he done?</font>

324
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hope has been eradicated.</font>

325
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now humanity will despair.</font>

326
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra Kusakabe must not become a hero.</font>

327
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is farewell.</font>

328
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a devil!</font>

329
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a devil who killed Raffles-sama!</font>

330
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Raffles-sama!</font>

331
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never forgive that fire soldier!</font>

332
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill him!</font>

333
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill him!</font>

334
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Devil!</font>

335
