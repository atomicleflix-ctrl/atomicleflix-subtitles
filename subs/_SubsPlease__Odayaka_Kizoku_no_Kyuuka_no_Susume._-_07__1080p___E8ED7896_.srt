<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#474239">Episode 7</font></font></font>

00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#474239">"The Night of the Promotion"</font></font></font>

3
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're back early.</font>

4
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our trip went well.
It's good to be back, Stud.</font>

5
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How was Marcade?</font>

6
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was interesting.</font>

7
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you familiar with the Forky Gang?</font>

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a stupid-sounding name, but I've 
been hearing it a lot recently.</font>

9
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know about stupid-sounding...</font>

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, never mind.</font>

11
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you attacked?</font>

12
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I'll rally the whole 
guild to wipe them out.</font>

13
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all right. We dealt with 
the people who attacked us.</font>

14
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, what kind of 
organization are they?</font>

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're an elusive group without 
a set base of operations.</font>

16
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet it's hard to learn anything about 
them if they have that much fodder.</font>

17
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I don't plan on traveling far for 
a while, so I doubt I'll see them again.</font>

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way...</font>

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong?</font>

20
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

21
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I simply thought you could raise</font>

22
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">your rank since you've defeated
 a subterranean dragon.</font>

23
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil basically defeated it by himself.</font>

24
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You contributed enough to its 
defeat to receive credit for it.</font>

25
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Contributed?</font>

26
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fighting isn't the only 
way to contribute.</font>

27
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're also not picky about the jobs you 
do, so broadly speaking, it's about time.</font>

28
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose. If I've met the conditions 
for a promotion, then I gladly accept.</font>

29
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. I'll get that 
taken care of right away.</font>

30
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now you're rank E.</font>

31
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Up to D should be easy.</font>

32
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is C difficult?</font>

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll probably be fine.</font>

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And B?</font>

35
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not ready for that yet.</font>

36
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I join your party?</font>

37
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to join us?</font>

38
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

39
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you introduce yourself and 
explain why you want to join?</font>

40
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Eleven.</font>

41
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My adventurer rank is solo C.</font>

42
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My strengths are my poison 
resistance and honesty.</font>

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My weaknesses are mornings and the cold.</font>

44
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to join a party capable of 
beating a subterranean dragon.</font>

45
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your strengths and motive 
are conflicting. Try again.</font>

46
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be back.</font>

47
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That boy is charming 
in all sorts of ways.</font>

48
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He has a distinct personality 
and aura about him.</font>

49
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop wasting time on what 
seems like a pain in the ass.</font>

50
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just curious.</font>

51
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you rejected him because 
he seemed to be lying?</font>

52
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that was probably 
him selling himself.</font>

53
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's honest, but he's willing 
to lie if it benefits him.</font>

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't call that honest.</font>

55
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stud, what do you think?</font>

56
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree with your assessment.</font>

57
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's strong enough to be rank C,
 but he accepts few jobs.</font>

58
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His appearance...</font>

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he perhaps a snake beastman?</font>

60
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poison resistance and weakness to 
cold must be traits of his species.</font>

61
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably. You don't see 
many of them around here.</font>

62
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you let him join your party?</font>

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure I can.</font>

64
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then.</font>

65
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Adventurers go drinking to celebrate 
promotions, don't they?</font>

66
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you join me today?</font>

67
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't drink.</font>

68
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, but I can soak up the atmosphere.</font>

69
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I join you as well?</font>

70
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

71
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations on your promotion.</font>

72
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stud, can't you be a 
little more, you know...</font>

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we're celebrating my 
promotion today, I'm paying.</font>

74
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you pay?</font>

75
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that odd?</font>

76
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You would like to play host.</font>

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I can cover this.</font>

78
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'll pay. Keep your 
mouth shut, dullard.</font>

79
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So mean...</font>

80
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at you drink.</font>

81
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't drink, Mr. Lizel? 
I'm a little surprised.</font>

82
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's simply my constitution.</font>

83
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get drunk off a single sip.</font>

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of drunk are you?</font>

85
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unfortunately, I don't recall.</font>

86
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first time I drank, 
my father, who was with me,</font>

87
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">laughed and said I didn't 
do anything odd.</font>

88
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:40,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when I next drank with a former 
student, I was told to never drink again.</font>

89
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said I was the opposite 
of my usual self.</font>

90
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You demand to be spoiled?</font>

91
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You become terribly cold?</font>

92
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You turn into a horndog?</font>

93
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil will be paying today. 
Don't hold back, you two.</font>

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like something filling.</font>

95
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's order some small plates, too.</font>

96
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

97
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did the escort job go?</font>

98
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I imagine it was more comfortable than 
most, traveling with this dullard.</font>

99
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop calling me that.</font>

100
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't do anything 
to bother them, did you?</font>

101
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, he took care 
of us the whole time.</font>

102
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Literally.</font>

103
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that not normal?</font>

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard of people being treated like 
cargo and stuffed into tight spaces.</font>

105
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say experience is everything. 
Perhaps I'll try escorting someone else.</font>

106
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't!</font>

107
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't bear to see 
you treated like that.</font>

108
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I have to accept all kinds 
of jobs to increase my rank.</font>

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm against it, too.</font>

110
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're looking to complete more jobs,</font>

111
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this dullard will submit 
as many as you need.</font>

112
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can take those.</font>

113
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not something I'd expect 
to hear from a guild employee.</font>

114
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that's what you want, I'll 
submit as many jobs as you need!</font>

115
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right, you two. Calm down.</font>

116
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, drink. Eat.</font>

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, I have something 
to brag to you about, Stud.</font>

118
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I supposed to do with that?</font>

119
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I slept next to Mr. Lizel like family.</font>

120
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next to him? How close were you?</font>

121
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got a good look at him sleeping.</font>

122
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ran into trouble on the way 
back, so he even held my hand.</font>

123
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think you're trying 
too hard to charm him?</font>

124
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Merchants are such 
black-hearted creatures.</font>

125
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's discrimination.</font>

126
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you behave yourself when 
you're around Mr. Lizel.</font>

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm simply honest with myself.</font>

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, may I stay in your room tonight?</font>

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

130
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind, but it's a single room.</font>

131
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's only one bed.</font>

132
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll sleep with you.</font>

133
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps there's an available double room.</font>

134
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He wants to sleep with you. Let him.</font>

135
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it'd be so cramped.</font>

136
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll sleep with you.</font>

137
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess we'll sleep together, then.</font>

138
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stud?</font>

139
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's just asleep.</font>

140
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what happens when 
he drinks to his limit.</font>

141
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised you can hold your liquor.</font>

142
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, Stud. Let's head back together.</font>

144
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going with you.</font>

145
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Stud.</font>

146
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

147
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we have Gil carry you?</font>

148
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

149
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm going this way.</font>

150
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you don't need an escort?</font>

151
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Um, I'd love to 
go out again sometime.</font>

152
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As would I.</font>

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are soft on younger guys.</font>

154
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're cute.</font>

155
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't see it.</font>

156
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Stud,</font>

157
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you've been particularly
belligerent towards Gil today.</font>

158
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh...</font>

159
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I expected this to happen, 
but not this soon.</font>

160
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The reasons he picks fights 
with me are simple.</font>

161
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He doesn't like that I'm 
accompanying you, and...</font>

162
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He hates men like himself.</font>

163
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't know my own origins.</i></font>

164
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>For as long as I could remember, I was 
living in the slums of the royal capital.</i></font>

165
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I killed who I was told to kill and 
lived off the money I made doing that.</i></font>

166
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I didn't even realize what 
I was doing was wrong.</i></font>

167
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then one day...</i></font>

168
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>An adult I didn't recognize 
appeared before me.</i></font>

169
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to kill anymore.</font>

170
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That adult was the current guildmaster.</font>

171
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm grateful that he didn't 
turn me over to the police.</font>

172
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've worked for the guild ever since.</font>

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't killed anyone 
like I did last night.</font>

174
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

175
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you start over from the top?</font>

176
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have the day off, don't you?</font>

177
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

178
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could've slept in a little longer.</font>

179
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I always wake 
up at the same time.</font>

180
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil says the same thing. I'm jealous.</font>

181
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something on your mind?</font>

182
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, won't last night's events 
be detrimental to you somehow?</font>

183
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was clearly a bandit of some sort.</font>

184
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if he's found, I can't 
imagine it'd be an issue.</font>

185
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope not.</font>

186
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it would harm you in some way, I'd 
rather you not get involved in the future.</font>

187
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd rather I stand there and watch?</font>

188
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can defend myself. I have Gil, too.</font>

189
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be careful not to 
inconvenience you in any way.</font>

190
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would it be better if I said losing 
you would be more inconvenient?</font>

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. I'll avoid doing anything 
to inconvenience you or myself.</font>

192
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. I appreciate that.</font>

193
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to get breakfast together?</font>

194
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, please.</font>

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Gil in his room?</font>

196
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, he left early this morning.</font>

197
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, Mr. Lizel.</font>

198
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

199
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did that boy stay overnight?</font>

200
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Forgive me for not getting 
your permission beforehand.</font>

201
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If necessary, I'll pay for my stay.</font>

202
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's no problem at all.</font>

203
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll throw in breakfast, too.</font>

204
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly...</font>

205
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's an adventurer's guild uniform.</font>

206
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are an adventurer, Mr. Lizel.</font>

207
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still didn't believe me?</font>

208
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was good.</font>

209
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

210
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stud?</font>

211
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Blade seems to have 
returned. I should go.</font>

212
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed. I couldn't tell at all.</font>

213
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That man last night was 
clearly targeting you.</font>

214
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know why, but please be careful.</font>

215
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you. You, too, Stud.</font>

216
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

217
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

218
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say we're alike, battle junkie.</font>

219
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then don't make me say it.</font>

220
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want to stay with him, 
protect him with your life, Blade.</font>

221
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, he was definitely 
connected to those bandits.</font>

222
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were using identical bows.</font>

223
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand why 
they're targeting me.</font>

224
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do I look like an easy target?</font>

225
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who shot 
the guy who got away.</font>

226
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe they resent you for that.</font>

227
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we didn't</font>

228
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hear a peep from them for the three
days it took to return after that.</font>

229
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way...</font>

230
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's going to continue.</font>

231
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was another one.</font>

232
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yesterday?</font>

233
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. More skilled than the archer.</font>

234
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then they deliberately
chose to use the same bow</font>

235
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and send an obvious bandit to attack me.</font>

236
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some guys can be really assertive.</font>

237
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I don't see what they're after.</font>

238
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't hate me, and they 
don't want to kill me either.</font>

239
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do they want to weaken me?</font>

240
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then it's obvious.</font>

241
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They want to ruin your composure.</font>

242
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. They're doing this for fun.</font>

243
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It probably would've 
worked on anyone else.</font>

244
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you feel about running errands?</font>

245
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't choose anything weird.</font>

246
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one looks good.</font>

248
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Helping an acting troupe?</font>

249
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you let me join your party?</font>

250
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you're yesterday's boy. Go ahead.</font>

251
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Solo C.</font>

252
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My strengths are my 
handsome voice and face.</font>

253
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My weakness is my gangly and 
distinctive appearance.</font>

254
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does he think that'll work?</font>

255
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The two of you stand out,</font>

256
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'd receive a comfortable amount 
of attention if I joined your party.</font>

257
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't sell yourself as 
an adventurer. Try again.</font>

258
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No good, huh?</font>

259
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you planning to accept that?</font>

260
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It intrigues me. Do you not want to?</font>

261
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

262
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what?</font>

263
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A little more this way!</font>

264
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Thanks!</font>

265
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Excuse—</font>

266
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not enough!</font>

267
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't enough, damn it!</font>

268
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love!</font>

269
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excitement!</font>

270
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thrills!</font>

271
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me...</font>

272
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it? Who are you?</font>

273
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you the troupe leader?</font>

274
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's me.</font>

275
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here about the mana 
replenishment job.</font>

276
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll replenish our mana? For 
two weeks while the show runs?</font>

277
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to see what I'm dealing with.</font>

278
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then look!</font>

279
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's impressive.</font>

280
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's passion itself.</font>

281
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see they're performing an original 
play called "The Phantasmal Traveler".</font>

282
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredible. The setting is unique, 
but it's simple and easy to follow.</font>

283
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could tell all that from skimming it?</font>

284
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's the magic item.</font>

285
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With this single item, we can project 
rain, snow, or even thunder.</font>

286
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you do it?</font>

287
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think so.</font>

288
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

289
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm counting on you.</font>

290
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't run out of mana.</font>

291
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't.</font>

292
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move it!</font>

293
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You can't be serious!</font>

295
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like the captain's 
fighting with the troupe.</font>

296
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Get this out of the way!</font>

297
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We can't! It takes time to move!</font>

298
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've got a wagon, so they're probably 
being told not to block the street.</font>

299
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Just do it!</font>

300
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Why do you have to come this way?</font>

301
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've got permission to be here, damn it.</font>

302
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to complain.</font>

303
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you stopping me, damn it?</font>

304
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd be unfair for me to say I'm looking 
forward to your performance, wouldn't it?</font>

305
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me make the first move.</font>

306
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Gil.</font>

307
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

308
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just hoping to say hello to him.</font>

309
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you recognize that crest?</font>

310
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can just go around us.</font>

311
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not embarrassing 
ourselves like that.</font>

312
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's good to see you again.</font>

313
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

314
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the viscount in there, isn't it?</font>

315
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to say hello to him.</font>

316
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

317
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, wait. You're an adventurer.</font>

318
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? No, a noble.</font>

319
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, an adventurer.</font>

320
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly.</font>

321
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can just go around 
them, then do it.</font>

322
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've become so stubborn since 
you were promoted to captain.</font>

323
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's good to see you again, Viscount Ray.</font>

324
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's you, Mr. Lizel.</font>

325
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How was Marcade?</font>

326
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a lively city.</font>

327
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I delivered your letter, so don't worry.</font>

328
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you managed to find him.</font>

329
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We didn't just find him. 
He made him buy us dinner.</font>

330
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil.</font>

331
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You made that cheapskate pay? Marvelous.</font>

332
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, I think that only 
put him more on guard.</font>

333
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did he say something to you?</font>

334
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a rather cautious man.</font>

335
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, nothing like that.</font>

336
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted him to meet you for his sake.</font>

337
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid you overestimate my abilities.</font>

338
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Modest, aren't you?</font>

339
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, yes.</font>

340
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Last night, the body of a possible 
bandit was found in the city.</font>

341
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know anything about that?</font>

342
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure. I haven't heard any 
rumors from other adventurers.</font>

343
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I think the bandit was 
a member of the Forky Gang.</font>

344
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They can be a difficult 
bunch. Be careful.</font>

345
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gil.</font>

346
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure you protect your companion.</font>

347
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I've been told already.</font>

348
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. If you'll excuse me.</font>

349
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they know who it was, 
they should do their jobs.</font>

350
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowing doesn't make it easy.</font>

351
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, the gang is elusive.</font>

352
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, asking you about it won't 
help them catch any bandits.</font>

353
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And catching bandits isn't 
an adventurer's job.</font>

354
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's let the professionals do their job.</font>

355
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't care even after 
they attacked you?</font>

356
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we continue replenishing 
the device's mana?</font>

357
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There.</font>

358
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's done.</font>

359
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for the help!</font>

360
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. It works.</font>

361
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Rather than projecting weather, it 
converts mana into snow and raindrops.</font>

362
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's beautiful.</font>
