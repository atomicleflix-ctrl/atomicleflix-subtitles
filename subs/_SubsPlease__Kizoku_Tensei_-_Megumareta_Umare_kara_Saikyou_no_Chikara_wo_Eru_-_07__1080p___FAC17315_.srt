<font size="13">Vice Minister of Justice</font></font></b></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My number two, eh?</i></font>

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's young. Still on the rise, I'm sure.</i></font>

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are my duties?</font>

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Explain it to me.
A rough outline will do.</font>

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. You have two primary duties.</font>

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,280
<font size="20">{\an8}<font size="15"><font face="Arial"><font color="#dcdcdc">Meeres Empire</font></font></font></font>

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First is the coordination of all 
courthouses across the empire.</font>

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our ministry also tries many 
cases that occur in the capital.</font>

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And, as with the rebellion six years ago,</font>

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it is customary for the ministry 
or the emperor himself</font>

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to judge those who commit serious 
crimes such as insurrection.</font>

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So in other words, the ministry also 
functions as a common courthouse.</font>

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is correct.</font>

19
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you try cases, as well?</font>

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Depending on the case.</font>

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how much do you receive in bribes?</font>

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I do no such thing!</font>

23
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not trying to force 
you into admitting guilt.</font>

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only want to know the real story.</font>

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll forget as soon as I leave this room.</font>

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just tell me the truth.</font>

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might have expected as much.</font>

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I, personally, do not accept many bribes.</font>

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A few hundred rean annually,
I suppose.</font>

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a rule, you see.</font>

31
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those beneath me accept at 
least ten times that much.</font>

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What rule?</font>

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not accept bribes 
in cases of murder.</font>

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that?</font>

35
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is too easily exposed.</font>

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the accuser bears a grudge, 
I could become a target for revenge,</font>

37
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">leading to irreparable damage.</font>

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I accept bribes only in cases that 
could easily go in either direction.</font>

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness?</font>

40
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assuming you take 500 in a year, I'll 
give you 5,000, ten times that.</font>

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will not accept bribes while I'm here.</font>

42
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to live up to the emperor's 
expectations. Please help me do so.</font>

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see why the emperor gave you 
the title of "the Wise" at age six</font>

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and appointed you 
minister-prince of justice.</font>

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need extra money,</font>

46
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,720

70
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,970

78

262
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Our emperor led this nation into a golden

267
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Clearly, the emperor no longer

268
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The reason he won't do 
anything about it now</i></font>

269
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,670

270
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,630

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty, if I may, 
I have a favor to ask.</font>

273
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,900

poorly somewhere down the line.</font>

276
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,200
