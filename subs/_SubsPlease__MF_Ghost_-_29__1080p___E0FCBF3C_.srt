25

28
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been wondering about that.</font>

29
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure our rivals will use the 
summer break to add their own upgrades.</font>

30
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a result, we can't afford
 to sit on our hands.</font>

31
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we have time, I might pull out 
the engine, take it apart, and rebuild it.</font>

32
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can re-balance and replace parts with
 ones more resilient to higher output.</font>

33
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, does that mean...</font>

34
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying you intend to boost it
 even more and give it more power?</font>

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could see it that way,
 but not necessarily.</font>

36
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll need the driver's opinion first.</font>

37
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking at the data,</font>

38
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Katagiri-kun spends more time on 
the accelerator than any other driver.</font>

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means more stress on the engine.</font>

40
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like he might be holding back 
 to some degree for the car's sake.</font>

41
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I want to build an engine 
that can keep up with this prodigy,</font>

42
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">no matter how hard he pushes it.</font>

43
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got two ideas in mind
for the Double Lane race:</font>

44
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">make the engine more resilient,</font>

45
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and take control of the invisible element.</font>

46
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An invisible element?</font>

47
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The airflow.</font>

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe it's nearly five
and the heat is still this bad.</font>

49
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's that late already? 
I'm getting hungry.</font>

50
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really looking forward to dinner.</font>

51
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like my attitude towards eating 
has changed since I came to Japan.</font>

52
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In England, except for 
on special occasions,</font>

53
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">eating was just something 
I did to satisfy my hunger.</font>

54
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now, every meal
every day is a big event.</font>

55
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love the rice Mama Mayuko serves.</font>

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, really?</font>

57
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My grandma in Niigata 
actually sends us that rice.</font>

58
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never eaten anything else, 
so I figured all rice tasted like that.</font>

59
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a type called "Koshihikari"
from Minami-Uonuma.</font>

60
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="TImes New Roman">Whoa, really?</font></font>

61
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Minami-Uonuma farms?</font>

62
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say the best-tasting rice 
in Japan comes from there.</font>

63
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea I was eating 
such a fancy brand on a daily basis.</font>

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explains why it's so good.</font>

65
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Kanata.</font>

66
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When it comes to Japanese rice, how would 
you like to try the best of the best?</font>

67
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kana-chan said that?</font>

68
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up?</font>

69
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's joining Ren on her trip to Niigata.</font>

70
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sounds wonderful.</font>

71
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we'll rest easier 
knowing he's with her.</font>

72
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We sure will.</font>

73
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, c'mon, Mom and Dad. 
It sounds weird when you put it like that.</font>

74
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like you'd be worried if I was on my own.</font>

75
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm</i> the one who's taking 
Kanata with <i>me</i>, okay?</font>

76
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, he's a foreigner. 
He wouldn't know left from right.</font>

77
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's true, but...</font>

78
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just such a relief 
that he's going with you.</font>

79
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?</font>

80
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now. Let's not fuss over semantics.</font>

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mom will also be glad to meet him. 
Give her my regards, Kanata-kun.</font>

82
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get carried away, Kanata.</font>

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm</i> the leader on this trip, okay?
 <font face="Times New Roman">Do you understand?</font></font>

85
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I get it.</font>

86
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Imagine fussing over something

87
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking at the map,</font>

88
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the route from Kanagawa to Niigata

89
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Bravo. <font face="Trebuchet MS">We're going over

90
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels a bit like we're driving

91
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This tunnel is super long.</font>

92
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was little, I used to 
get afraid going through it.</font>

93
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd close my eyes in the back of

96
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandma, are you here? It's Ren!</font>

97
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Ren-chan. You've grown 
so much since I last saw you.</font>

98
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me introduce you, Grandma.
 This is Kanata.</font>

99
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, my, he's as tall and slender
 as a beech tree.</font>

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nice to meet you.
I'm Katagiri Kanata.</font>

101
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for coming all this way.</font>

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have much, 
but make yourself at home.</font>

103
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ren-chan, could you light 
some incense at the altar?</font>

104
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure Grandpa would like that.</font>

105
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

106
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should join me, Kanata.
For the incense and the bell.</font>

107
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is an altar for the gods?</font>

108
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's called a "butsudan." 
Our ancestors are enshrined there.</font>

109
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So every day, we put our hands together
 and express our gratitude.</font>

110
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And in exchange, 
our ancestors look out for us.</font>

111
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So for Japanese people, 
ancestors are a bit like God for Christians.</i></font>

112
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Wow, amazing!</font></font>

113
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pretty, isn't it? 
This place is called Bijin Bayashi.</font>

114
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bijin Bayashi?</font>

115
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a forest of beech trees.</font>

116
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing, Ren?</font>

117
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beech trees are supposed to 
have lots of water in their trunks.</font>

118
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So if you put your ear to them, 
you can hear the water flowing.</font>

119
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with that face? 
Are you making fun of me?</font>

120
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've just never heard anything 
like that before. It seems ridiculous.</font>

121
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The trunk of a tree 
shouldn't make a noise.</font>

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't believe me, 
try it for yourself.</font>

123
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandma told me about it.</font>

124
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have my doubts.</font>

125
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Wow. <font face="Trebuchet MS">I can hear it.</font></font></font>

126
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never experienced 
something like this before.</font>

127
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A tree trunk that makes a noise.</font>

128
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Beech trees are pretty amazing, right?</font>

129
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're back.</font>

130
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandma, let me help with the cooking.</font>

131
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Ren-chan, you're a sweet girl. 
And so mature now.</font>

132
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. I'm already 
a junior in high school.</font>

133
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anything I can help with?</font>

134
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I won't have that.</font>

135
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't have a young fella making 
a nuisance of himself in the kitchen.</font>

136
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's right, Kanata. Just watch some TV.</font>

137
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. I just feel guilty 
getting fed without helping out.</font>

138
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you need any heavy lifting
 done later, let me know.</font>

139
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a sweet one, that Kanata-san.</font>

140
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He is. Mom and Dad 
are head over heels for him.</font>

141
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your grandma's never seen such a fine man.
Not even over in Tokamachi or Joetsu.</font>

142
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think so?</font>

143
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he one of them celebrities off the TV?</font>

144
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Kanata is a racing driver.</font>

145
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, ain't that something?</font>

146
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like more, Kanata-san?</font>

147
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, much more, please.</font>

148
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weird. You usually 
don't eat this much.</font>

149
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your grandmother's 
cooking smells fantastic.</font>

150
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makes sense.</font>

151
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the way she seasons the eggplant 
with miso and shishito peppers.</font>

152
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you are.</font>

153
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much.</font>

154
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Amazing.</font></font>

155
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad you like it, Kanata.</font>

158
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did they drive to Niigata in the 86?</font>

159
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. In the same red car
I always see on the broadcasts.</font>

160
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It had the number on 
the door and everything.</font>

161
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Unbelievable. My daughter 
has no idea how good she has it.</i></font>

162
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Getting to navigate for the 86 car

163
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She'd faint if she realized how much
 that experience is worth.</i></font>

164
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder if I might ever get the chance...</i></font>

165
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Grandma.</font>

166
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go for a ride on your kei truck!</font>

167
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, well, I guess we can
 take it for a spin.</font>

168
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should come, too, Kanata. 
Grandma owns this whole place.</font>

169
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's only a two-seater.</font>

170
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ride in the back.</font>

171
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the best part 
of riding a kei truck.</font>

172
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You hold on like this.</font>

176
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry it up, Kanata.</font>

177
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All ready? Off we go.</font>

178
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so fun!</font>

179
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, this is thrilling!
It's like being on a cabin cruiser!</font>

180
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feels good, doesn't it?</font>

181
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is great, Grandma!</font>

182
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're one funky driver!</font>

183
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandma, go faster!</font>

184
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure thing!</font>

185
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,530

186
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,410

190
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Mayuko-san? No, no trouble at all.
 They're both good kids.</font>

191
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been having a real good time myself.</font>

192
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just finished eating lunch.</font>

193
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, okay. Don't you worry now.</font>

194
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to take a nap.
You two should get some rest, too.</font>

195
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A nap?</font>

196
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on and open the window.
Should get a nice breeze going.</font>

197
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll feel sweet as all get out
laying out underneath it.</font>

198
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did all of that mean?</font>

199
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That it'll feel good.</font>

200
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wow, he's already asleep.</i></font>

201
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kanata must be fully relaxed.</i></font>

202
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, boy. How is he so </i>cute<i>?

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since he's looking so cute,

206
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, there's nothing else to do,

207
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What should I do?

208
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,210

211
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But, y'know, I can't deny
that I'm kinda happy.</i></font>

212
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,780

215
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's so quiet and cool.</i></font>

216
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's like a different world from Shonan.</i></font>

218
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

219
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a giant dragonfly!</font>

220
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has yellow and black bands,

221
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,340

222
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think that's an oniyanma dragonfly.</font>

223
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's lots of them in Niigata. 
You don't get them in England?</font>

224
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's new to me!</font>

225
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ren, I really want to catch it.</font>

226
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,690

227
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, you can't. Not without a net.</font>

228
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

229
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Grandma, do you know where 
we can get a net for catching dragonflies?</font>

230
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hard to say. Kids these days 
don't do that sorta thing.</font>

231
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe down at the hardware store?</font>

232
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Off we go! Full speed ahead!</font>

236
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,940

237
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way! Seriously?</font>

238
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, we catch it.</font>

239
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,860

241
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dad and I used to catch 
these bugs when I was little.</font>

242
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,560

243
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,720

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not slow.</font>

246
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,930

247
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,200

250
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,050

251
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weird.</font>

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is hard.</font>

253
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's coming back this way.</font>

254
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it, Ren.</font>

255
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ouch!</font>

256
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did that on purpose, Ren.
How else could you miss that bad?</font>

257
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weird. I wonder if they've evolved
 to be faster over time.</font>

258
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please let me try.</font>

259
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I can't do it with all my experience, 
there's no way a slowpoke like you can.</font>

260
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the slow one, Ren.</font>

261
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you say?</font>

262
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They get along like real siblings.</i></font>

263
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you hold the net like this, 
the dragonfly's on alert and avoids you,</font>

264
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">thinking you're an obstacle.</font>

265
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be more like this. 
Then it can't see how long the tool is.</font>

266
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna catch a huge, 
impressive-looking female.</font>

267
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one's female, Kanata-san.</font>

268
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes! <font face="Trebuchet MS">This is my chance!</font></font></font>

269
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why are the females 
only showing up for Kanata?</i></font>

270
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The species doesn't matter to you,
 does it? You womanizer.</i></font>

271
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i><font face="Times New Roman">Come on.</font></i></font>

272
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Don't underestimate the reflexes
 of a racing driver.</i></font>

273
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got one!</font>

274
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?</font>

275
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, it's so cool-looking.</font>

276
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And very striking up close.</font>

277
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like one of those kaiju 
in a Godzilla movie.</font>

278
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's gonna eat you up, Ren. Roar!</font>

279
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He really does act like a grade-schooler.</i></font>

280
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now that I'm satisfied, 
let's return this dragonfly to the sky.</font>

281
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Goodbye, oniyanma girl.</font></font>

282
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's hoping you find a wonderful 
summer romance and lay a ton of eggs.</font>

283
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandma, where are you going?</font>

284
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just to tidy up the grave.</font>

285
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's almost Obon, after all.</font>

286
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll come with you.</font>

287
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's boots in the storage room,
 so put those on.</font>

288
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's Obon?</font>

289
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Obon is the one time every year
 when our ancestors come home.</font>

290
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We make sure their graves are clean,</font>

291
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they can be at ease when they visit.</font>

292
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are your ancestors normally?</font>

293
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Georgia"><font size="8">{\an8}<font color="#c1c2c5">Ancestral
Grave</font></font></font></font>

294
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most of the time, they go wherever 
they want, free as a bird.</font>

295
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

296
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My mum died last year.</font>

297
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I'm sorry to hear that.</font>

298
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to think that 
instead of staying put in heaven,</font>

299
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she's staying active
and enjoying herself.</font>

300
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't doubt it.</font>

301
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure your mother is worried about you,
 and always watching out for you.</font>

302
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if something happens and 
you need help, I bet she'll be there.</font>

303
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My mum will be there to help me?</font>

304
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what parents do.</font>

305
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't matter if 
you're Japanese or English.</font>

306
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really glad I got 
to meet you, Grandma.</font>

307
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you lonely out here by yourself?</font>

308
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all! This is a great place 
that's rich in nature.</font>

309
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for the winters... 
It can be rough when the snow piles up,</font>

310
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but my husband and I worked 
hard to manage this land.</font>

311
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've gotta keep it that way, so our kids 
and grandkids can stop by anytime.</font>

312
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can come by whenever 
you like, too, Kanata-san.</font>

313
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The colors are quite a sight in the fall.</font>

314
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't mind me visiting?</font>

315
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not! I already consider you 
one of the grandkids, Kanata-san.</font>

316
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're always welcome here.</font>

317
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't start crying now. We've got 
some tasty watermelon on the cool.</font>

318
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's hard to believe. 
It's like something out of a dream.</i></font>

319
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This place has such kindness within it.</i></font>

320
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch yourselves out on 
those roads. And come again.</font>

321
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We had a great time, Grandma. 
Thanks for everything.</font>

322
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm touched by your kindness. 
This will be a summer I never forget.</font>

323
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, enough with all that. 
Grandma had herself a good time, too.</font>

324
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Love you, <font face="Trebuchet MS">Grandma.</font></font></font>

325
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, my.</font>

326
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye-bye, Grandma. Take care.</font>

327
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've never seen Kanata 
give someone a hug before.</i></font>

328
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I guess even he couldn't resist
 Grandma's charms.</i></font>

329
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Honey, our granddaughter has 
turned into quite the young lady.</i></font>

330
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's old enough to fall in love now.</i></font>

331
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And while it might be beyond 
our ability to help her with that,</i></font>

332
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't want her 
to experience any heartache,</i></font>

333
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so I hope you'll be rooting for her.</i></font>

334
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Bye-bye, Niigata.</i></font>

335
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Next time, Turn 30: The 1:09PM Miracle.</i></font>
