<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It felt wrong, but I took a peek

112
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,700

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's very mature of you.</font>

131
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Really?</font>

132
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to ask you over for this.</font>

133
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's a big deal.</font>

134
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, it was easier
 than you thought, wasn't it?</font>

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asking for help.</font>

136
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All you need to do 
is reach out and say so.</font>

137
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was really hard, actually.</font>

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Koudai-san!</font>

139
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to keep you waiting.</font>

140
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tono-sensei! Thank you for coming.</font>

141
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have anywhere in mind?</font>

142
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I asked her friend for ideas, so I was
 thinking of checking those places first.</font>

143
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for making 
such a fuss about this.</font>

144
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... I'd argue it's better
 to make a big deal out of it.</font>

145
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asa-san is facing the reality that 
she's lost her biggest supporters.</font>

146
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not rare for children to test
 the adults around them.</font>

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I think it'll be good to show her that 
this many adults are concerned for her.</font>

148
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if we're not her parents.</font>

149
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you're right...</font>

150
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna scold her good.</font>

151
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can be scary when you're mad.</font>

152
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go easy on her.</font>

153
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Everyone's got their own thing besides me.</i></font>

154
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How's that fair?</i></font>

155
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Emiri grew five centimeters just this year.</i></font>

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Chiyo-chan's pretty </i>and<i> smart.</i></font>

157
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And Asuka-chan's family is super rich.</i></font>

158
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm the only one with nothing.</i></font>

159
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's not fair.</i></font>

160
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Screw them.</i></font>

161
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's not fair.</i></font>

162
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Screw them.</i></font>

163
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's not fair.</i></font>

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's all Mom's fault.</i></font>

165
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All of this...</i></font>

166
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's 'cause you went and died.</i></font>

167
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe she's preparing to accept it.</font>

168
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asa, I mean. That her parents are gone.</font>

169
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, maybe.</font>

170
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She sleeps a lot.</font>

171
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's her way of tending her wounds.</font>

172
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To process what happened internally.</font>

173
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe she still doesn't know 
how to get through it yet.</font>

174
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm cold by nature.</font>

175
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't grieve at all 
when my father died.</font>

176
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To this day, I feel no grief.</font>

177
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's not like I hated him.</font>

178
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps it is a bit sad, but that's all.</font>

179
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I can't find the right 
words to say to Asa.</font>

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You? Cold?</font>

181
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me a break.</font>

182
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say you're full of passion.</font>

183
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like how you get a bit grumpy.</font>

184
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not—</font>

185
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think we're close.</font>

186
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Let's park around here.</font>

187
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bubble tea place down the street?</font>

188
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Apparently they've 
hung out there before.</font>

189
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh.</font>

190
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... Would a child skip 
school for bubble tea?</font>

191
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no clue what they'd 
skip school for.</font>

192
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me neither.</font>

193
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait.</font>

194
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neither of you have 
skipped school before?</font>

195
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No.</font>

196
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope.</font>

197
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always attended the early study 
hours before school, so...</font>

198
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow.</font>

199
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I did it once.</font>

200
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My first year of high school.</font>

201
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My friend invited me out for ramen.</font>

202
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? You did it too.</font>

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was fun. We got caught, of course.</font>

204
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The teacher barely even scolded us.</font>

205
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when I got home, my dad 
clicked his tongue at me.</font>

206
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Dad, I'm sorry...</font>

207
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jeez...</font>

208
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I turned stark white.</font>

209
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was the first and last time.</font>

210
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'd like to raise an 
objection with your father!</font>

211
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

212
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He should have talked to you 
instead of clicking his tongue.</font>

213
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's out of line.</font>

214
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A single interaction can hurt 
a child's self-esteem.</font>

215
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially after they've 
expressed remorse—</font>

216
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, I'm sorry. I mean no 
disrespect to your family.</font>

217
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. In fact, I'd love to hear
 you bash my dad more. Really.</font>

218
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not often you get to hear—</font>

219
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There she is.</font>

220
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And she's drinking bubble tea... 
while skipping school.</font>

221
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, that little...</font>

222
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio-san, keep your cool.</font>

223
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Georgia"><font size="18"><font color="#000000">Journal with Witch</font></font></font></font>

224
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, these things are so chewy.</font>

225
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And filling...</font>

226
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, right?</font>

227
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought the same when 
somebody gave me some before.</font>

228
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could replace an 
entire lunch with this.</font>

229
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

230
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

231
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think I can finish this.</font>

232
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's different when you're young.</font>

233
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Asa-san?</font>

234
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were really worried.</font>

235
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar.</font>

236
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just want Makio-chan to like you.</font>

237
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're an important friend to me too.</font>

238
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I was worried.</font>

239
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes me sad to hear you say that.</font>

240
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for waiting. Are you ready to go?</font>

241
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two can take the backseat.</font>

242
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

243
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What gives?</font>

244
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up with all of you?</font>

245
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About school...</font>

246
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you need a day off, you can say so.</font>

247
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's <i>not</i> okay is lying to everyone.</font>

248
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You're the one who's been lying!</font>

249
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me?</font>

250
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The journal. You hid it from me.
 My mom's journal.</font>

251
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was tucked away
 in the back of your room.</font>

252
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I found it, you know?</font>

253
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asa-san, you went into Makio's 
room without asking?</font>

254
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you're family, that's not—</font>

255
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kasamachi-kun.</font>

256
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. I can't believe
 I'm acting like my dad.</font>

257
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asa, I wasn't hiding it from you.</font>

258
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have every right to read that journal.</font>

259
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever. Your room's so dirty, 
I couldn't believe it.</font>

260
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can you even live like that?</font>

261
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's beside the point right now.</font>

262
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And trying to hurt me in this moment 
won't solve anything.</font>

263
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First things first, we talk it out.</font>

264
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't forget that.</font>

265
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you, Asa-san.</font>

266
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hash it all out, okay?</font>

267
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well then, I'll be off as well.</font>

268
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Thank you so much for your help.</font>

269
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You too, Kasamachi-kun.</font>

270
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I'll reach be in touch soon.</font>

271
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure have it nice, Makio-chan.</font>

272
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Sure.</font>

273
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got all these people 
who care about you.</font>

274
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They came out to help because 
they were worried about you.</font>

275
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but I know I don't come first.</font>

276
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To put someone above all else
 is an enormous act.</font>

277
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's beyond my comprehension.</font>

278
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when I saw your mother's journal,
that was the impression I got.</font>

279
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You read it?</font>

280
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I didn't.
 It would have only annoyed me.</font>

281
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just checked to see 
if it should be tossed.</font>

282
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, no, I wasn't hiding it from you.</font>

283
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just hadn't decided 
when to give it to you.</font>

284
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

285
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reading this won't tell me 
what Mom was actually thinking.</font>

286
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. It won't.</font>

287
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that what you're hung up on?</font>

288
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll pour us some tea first.</font>

289

290
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may be looking to me to tell you 
what your mother thought...</font>

291
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can't do that.</font>

292
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I cannot declare what I'm unsure of.</font>

293
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the departed cannot 
speak for themselves.</font>

294
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just making excuses.</font>

295
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's not my intent...</font>

296
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I'm not right about everything.</font>

297
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what I'm about to say 
is just a guess on my part, but...</font>

298
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seeing the way you are now, 
I think you grew up loved.</font>

299
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asa.</font>

300
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In which case, I think my 
sister lived a good life.</font>

301
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope that's the truth.</font>

302
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Happy birthday, Asa.</i></font>

303
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how I feel.</font>

304
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though you hated her?</font>

305
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That has nothing to do with this.</font>

306
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makio-chan, have you ever lost 
anyone important to you?</font>

307
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

308
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I have experienced 
something very sad.</font>

309
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't intend to share it with anyone.</font>

310
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not? Isn't that lonely?</font>

311
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's not lonely. Not for me.</font>

312
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My emotions are very important to me.</font>

313
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one has the right to trample them.</font>

314
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And no one will ever feel 
the exact sadness I do.</font>

315
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I don't care to share it with anyone.</font>

316
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get that at all!</font>

317
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand...</font>

318
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, at the very least...</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To leave something in writing 
for someone is tremendous work.</font>

321
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not possible without deep conviction.</font>

322
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever! Get real.</font>

323
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean your novels too?</font>

324
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps, yes.</font>

325
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on and finish your tea.</font>

326
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going out to get groceries.</font>
