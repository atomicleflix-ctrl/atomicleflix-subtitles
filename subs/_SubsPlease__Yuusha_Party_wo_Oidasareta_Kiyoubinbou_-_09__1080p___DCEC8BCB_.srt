HAS A BAD FEELING</font>

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, get seated.</font>

3
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The meeting's about to start.</font>

4
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe I get to go 
dungeon-delving with my comrades again...</i></font>

5
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't betray everyone's 
expectations for me,</i></font>

6
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>after they've let me join them.</i></font>

7
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About today's plans...</font>

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Adventure Management Division has 
asked us to collect Noxious Sheep pelts.</font>

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be practicing our 
teamwork on Floor 86...</font>

10
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll make sure we all get to Floor 94,</i></font>

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so we're equal with the Heroes Party!</i></font>

12
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will begin our exploration of Floor 86!</font>

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the lower floors 
of the Great Dungeon,</font>

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the scenery's so nice 
it makes you want to relax.</font>

15
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every floor above us is 
just caves, after all.</font>

16
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of the great things about reaching</font>

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the lower floors is the different 
scenery you can enjoy.</font>

18
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No letting your guard down.</font>

19
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our goal is the Noxious Sheep,</font>

20
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's lots of tough 
Earth Dragons down here too.</font>

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once again, our major goal here 
is to see how we work with Orhun.</font>

22
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad to have you here, Orhun.</font>

23
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, glad to be here.</font>

24
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wil's job will be to keep 
the monsters' attention.</font>

25
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rain will attack from the rear with magic.</font>

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger that!</font>

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucre, join the attack, but make sure 
you've got healing magic ready to go.</font>

28
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

29
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll keep everyone buffed 
and give the orders.</font>

30
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Orhun, you stay at 
the front as an attacker.</font>

31
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

32
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can probably defeat all 
the monsters yourself, Orhun.</font>

33
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe we'll actually be slowing you down.</font>

34
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, if it's easier for you to just 
fight on your own, I'm okay with that.</font>

35
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a part of this party.</font>

36
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can give me orders.</font>

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Orhun's off on his own, we can't 
learn to work with him, right?</font>

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

39
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

40
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't space out on us, Boss.</font>

41
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not like you, Selma.</font>

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch out!</font>

43
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun!</font>

44
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This attack...</font>

45
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An Earth Dragon.</font>

46
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't see it.</font>

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to find it, first.</font>

48
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me.</font>

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got Magic Tracking!</font>

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic Tracking?</font>

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's her special ability.</font>

52
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She can follow traces of 
magic to locate her foe.</font>

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Found it!</font>

54
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flash!</font>

55
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My turn, then.</font>

56
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch me, Orhun!</font>

57
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah... It's better that you 
see our strength for yourself.</font>

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rain, prepare to attack.</font>

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic Up!</font>

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hah-yah!</font>

61
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Is that all you've got?</font>

62
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll fire off the big guns 
to celebrate Orhun's arrival!</font>

63
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Explode!</font>

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was fast.</font>

65
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

66
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Orhun?</font>

67
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised.</font>

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You work together incredibly well.</font>

69
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're being so polite again.</font>

70
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just so impressed.</font>

71
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm surprised that he didn't just 
block the attack, he canceled it.</i></font>

72
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That double blade is a weapon 
that barely anyone can use, too.</i></font>

73
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And the way she was able to construct</i></font>

74
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>a special-rank skill like 
Explode at that speed...</i></font>

75
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It would've taken most 
casters twice as long.</i></font>

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And Lucre's Magic Tracking 
is amazing, too.</i></font>

77
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The hardest part of any dungeon 
dive is finding the monsters.</i></font>

78
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You could say it's 
indispensable for a party.</i></font>

79
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And Selma's leadership abilities 
bring them together.</i></font>

80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're an ideal party.</i></font>

81
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you staring at me?</font>

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just thinking how 
impressive you and Unit 1 are.</font>

83
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, we're not that special...</font>

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma's blushing!</font>

85
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucre!</font>

86
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like we woke up 
some sleeping kiddos.</font>

87
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two of them, huh?</font>

88
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perfect. Let's practice our teamwork.</font>

89
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Orhun.</font>

90
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

91
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What's wrong?</font>

92
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rock Arrow!</font>

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Hiding Turtle?</font>

94
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good catch, Orhun.</font>

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is bad. We're trapped between 
it and the Earth Dragons.</i></font>

96
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hiding Turtles have tough 
shells, but move slow.</font>

97
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rain, Lucre, you handle it.</font>

98
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger!</font>

99
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wil, Orhun, take down the Earth Dragons!</font>

100
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about what's behind you!</font>

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

102
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her decisions and orders came fast.</i></font>

103
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's somebody you can trust.</i></font>

104
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me!</font>

105
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Go around to the side, Orhun.</i></font>

106
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma?</font>

107
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is my special ability, Telepathy.</i></font>

108
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can communicate from a distance.</i></font>

109
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What? That's incredibly useful!</i></font>

110
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you...</font>

111
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Target the Earth Dragons' blind spot!</i></font>

112
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Buff yourself how you want.</i></font>

113
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll let you decide.</i></font>

114
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger!</font>

115
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wil, keep them distracted!</i></font>

116
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that, Boss!</font>

117
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Stop calling me that!</i></font>

118
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Rain, how's it looking?</i></font>

119
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's just a turtle with a tough shell.</i></font>

120
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're fine. Leave it to us.</i></font>

121
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Selma's special ability is incredible.</i></font>

122
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's what I wanted most of all 
when I was in the Heroes Party.</i></font>

123
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Strength Up!</font>

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Technical Up!</font>

125
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sharpness Up!</font>

126
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm in position!</i></font>

127
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Match the timing with Wil!</i></font>

128
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Five seconds until attack.</i></font>

129
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Four, three, two...</i></font>

130
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Orhun, go for it!</i></font>

131
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impact!</font>

132
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's "Impact"?</font>

133
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's amazing!</font>

134
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because you lured them 
into position for me. Thanks.</font>

135
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's the Hiding Turtle?</font>

136
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wrapping up!</i></font>

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mjölnir!</font>

138
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ice Javelin!</font>

139
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Good work, everyone.</i></font>

140
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're done.</i></font>

141
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, that was pretty good for 
your first time working with us.</font>

142
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was great.</font>

143
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been forever since 
fighting was this easy for me.</font>

144
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Easier than when you were 
in the Heroes Party?</font>

145
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I think so.</font>

146
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad I was able to join you.</font>

147
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes us happy.</font>

148
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm happy too.</i></font>

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're all helping each other.</i></font>

150
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's normal for a party, but...</i></font>

151
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd almost forgotten 
how much fun it was...</i></font>

152
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're amazing, too!</font>

153
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That "Impact" spell was amazing!</font>

154
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen anyone cut clean 
through two Earth Dragons before!</font>

155
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

156
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, may I ask a question?</font>

157
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

158
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From your perspective, 
are we ready for Floor 92?</font>

159
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, of course.</font>

160
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you're here?</font>

161
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

162
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you could defeat the 
Black Dragon without me.</font>

163
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

164
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean it.</font>

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your strength is enough 
to make me believe that.</font>

166
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

167
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've worked as hard as we 
could for the past year...</font>

168
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we didn't know if it 
had amounted to anything.</font>

169
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But hearing it from the dragonslayer 
makes me believe it!</font>

170
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They've probably practiced incredibly 
hard since losing Albert.</i></font>

171
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm sure that they're strong enough 
now to beat the Black Dragon.</i></font>

172
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the Black Dragon is strong.</font>

173
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredibly strong.</font>

174
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seeing its strength during the teaching 
expedition reminded me of that.</font>

175
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to lose anyone else.</font>

176
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want any more deaths.</font>

177
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please, fight with us.</font>

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We want your help.</font>

179
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

180
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a part of Unit 1 too.</font>

181
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Defeating the Black Dragon 
is Unit 1's long-held wish.</font>

182
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I swore I'd protect my comrades 
to the end no matter what.</font>

183
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

184
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Orhun.</font>

185
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, all that's left is 
to hunt some Noxious Sheep!</font>

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's finish it up and go home.</font>

187
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

188
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The air on the surface smells so good!</font>

189
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many Noxious Sheep 
did we end up killing?</font>

190
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nine in total, I think.</font>

191
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun did a great job 
of collecting the pelts,</font>

192
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so the mission was a success.</font>

193
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did a great job on that, Orhun!</font>

194
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

195
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucre couldn't do it that cleanly.</font>

196
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd do it even worse than me!</font>

197
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can do it a million 
times better than you.</font>

198
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma, I'm supposed to go see the 
Adventure Management Division tomorrow.</font>

199
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you tell me where it is later?</font>

200
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Did you want me 
to go with you, then?</font>

201
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you?</font>

202
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to report the 
mission's success, too.</font>

203
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're free in the morning, 
let's meet up and go.</font>

204
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then, Orhun!</font>

205
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome to the Night Sky 
Silver Rabbits' Unit 1!</font>

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

207
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

208
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, everyone.</font>

209
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, thank you.</font>

210
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After you defeated the Black Dragon, 
any number of places would want you.</font>

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm grateful you came to us.</font>

212
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to do our best so 
he doesn't regret it, huh?</font>

213
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regret it? No way...</font>

214
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had such fun in the 
dungeon with this party.</font>

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to continue helping everyone.</font>

216
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes me so happy!</font>

217
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm also glad that you're a lot easier 
to talk to than I thought you'd be!</font>

218
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Why are you crying?!</font>

219
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I was a little worried 
I wouldn't get along with Orhun!</font>

220
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm really happy!</font>

221
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was actually really nervous, too!</font>

222
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't sure I'd be able to 
support you from the rear...</font>

223
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me too!</font>

224
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I couldn't work with you on the front 
lines, I figured we'd be in trouble!</font>

225
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, so all of us were worried?</font>

226
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys should've said something!</font>

227
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was really nervous!</font>

228
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you'd be nervous if you thought 
you were the only one, right?</font>

229
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know, I bet Selma was 
the most nervous of us all.</font>

230
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you're right.</font>

231
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'd taken a big interest 
in Orhun, after all.</font>

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What are you saying?</font>

233
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't even bother to try and hide it.</font>

234
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was a little too interested, 
actually. So maybe...</font>

235
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-As leader, I just</font>

236
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wanted to make sure he felt 
comfortable here as soon as possible.</font>

237
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all. Right?</font>

238
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I had a great time thanks to you.</font>

239
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad you're the leader.</font>

240
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">G-Good then.</font>

241
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Boss gulped down her drink!</font>

242
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Selma!</font>

243
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Drink! Drink!</font>

244
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, another round!</font>

245

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The Old Man always said regrets 
come with any decision.</i></font>

246
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But right now I don't 
regret joining this clan.</i></font>

247
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,360

248
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma, are you okay?</font>

249
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

250
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know...</font>

251
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're such a handsome man, Orhun.</font>

252
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop joking around.</font>

253
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm serious.</font>

254
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh no...</i></font>

255
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If she gets close to me 
with that expression...</i></font>

257
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wide open!</font>

258
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma, you're drunk!</font>

259
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not drunk!</font>

260
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what drunk people say!</font>

261
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun!</font>

262
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

263
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not? You know, I...</font>

264
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been waiting for 
this day for so long!</font>

265
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not getting away until morning.</font>

266
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until morning?!</font>

267
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?</font>

268
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rain! Can you calm Selma down?</font>

269
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, sure thing.</font>

270
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me join in.</font>

271
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her too?!</i></font>

272
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? You're trying to say I'm 
not serious enough yet, huh?</font>

273
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That just made it even worse!</i></font>

274
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun's super-popular!</font>

275
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A girl on each arm! Nice!</font>

276
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help me, you two!</font>

277
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now.</font>

278
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the star of the show today.</font>

279
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what happens, we won't look.
Or we'll look, but we won't say anything!</font>

280
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care whether or not 
you look, just save me!</font>

281
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her breasts...</i></font>

282
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her breath...</i></font>

283
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's so soft and warm...</i></font>

284
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What should I do?</i></font>

285
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What am I supposed to do?</i></font>

286
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun...</font>

287
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun...</font>

288
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's all over...</i></font>

289
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I didn't want to have to do this, but...</i></font>

290
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Induce Sleep!</font>

291
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whew...</font>

292
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thank you, Selma.</i></font>

293
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's been a long time since 
I've had this much fun.</i></font>

294
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sister's late...</font>

295
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard she was going into 
the dungeon with Orhun.</font>

296
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she can't still be 
down there at this hour.</font>

297
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is she doing?</font>

298
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sister?</font>

299
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's me.</font>

300
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to come at this hour...</font>

301
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Orhun's coming back at 
this time of night? Why?</i></font>

302
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is he here to see me?</i></font>

303
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No way...</i></font>

304
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm dressed like this...</i></font>

305
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What should I do? I'm embarrassed...</i></font>

306
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. Could you open the door?</font>

307
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay! Coming!</font>

308
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello...</font>

309
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's going on here?</i></font>

310
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe my sister's coming 
home in the morning, carried by Orhun!</i></font>

311
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I mean, it's night, but still.</i></font>

312
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Sophia?</font>

313
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun, when did your relationship 
with my sister become like that?</font>

314
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Like that?"</font>

315
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! There's nothing between me and Selma!</font>

316
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for the misunderstanding.</font>

317
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She drank too much and passed out, 
so I brought her home.</font>

318
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

319
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was surprised.</font>

320
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

321
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My sister never gets this drunk.</i></font>

322
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She must've had a lot of fun today.</i></font>

323
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun...</font>

324
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A </i>lot<i> of fun.</i></font>

325
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sister, wake up!</font>

326
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not yet...</font>

327
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sister!</font>

328
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia?</font>

329
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're awake, then why not climb down?</font>

330
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're bothering Orhun, you know.</font>

331
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia?!</font>

332
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to tell me 
what happened, right?</font>

333
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you drank too much at 
Orhun's welcome party?</font>

334
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm sorry.</font>

335
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was smiling as he left,</font>

336
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the way you were acting 
must've really bothered him.</font>

337
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm sorry.</font>

338
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel really bad about it.</font>

339
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, fine.</font>

340
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been really busy and under 
a lot of stress lately, right?</font>

341
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can finally relax now 
that Orhun's here, I guess.</font>

342
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you let yourself have 
a bit too much fun, right?</font>

343
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get it.</font>

344
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll forgive me?</font>

345
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing for me to forgive.</font>

346
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a little upsetting, but...</font>

347
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not right to get mad at you 
because of these feelings...</font>

348
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know, be careful 
from now on, okay?</font>

349
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No causing trouble for other people, okay?</font>

350
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia!</font>

351
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's such an angel!</i></font>

352
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No causing trouble for other people, okay?</font>

353
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is my little sister an angel from heaven?</i></font>

354
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm so lucky to have an 
angel for a little sister...</i></font>

355
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Is it worth crying over?!</font>

356
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're exaggerating.</font>

357
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sophia smiles so much 
more than she used to.</i></font>

358
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I don't think it's because of me.</i></font>

359
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's because of Orhun.</i></font>

360
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I hate to admit it, but...</i></font>

361
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels so good...</font>

362
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sophia's right. 
I feel a little more relaxed.</i></font>

363
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's thanks to Orhun.</i></font>

364
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I still can't believe 
he carried me home...</i></font>

365
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He must be exasperated with me.</i></font>

366
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I embarrassed myself so badly.</i></font>

367
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And in front of Sophia.</i></font>

368
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to be careful from now on 
or Sophia will misunderstand again.</i></font>

369
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I should be supportive of my little 
sister's first love, I'm sure.</i></font>

370
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As a good sister.</i></font>

371
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why am I thinking about this stuff?</i></font>

372
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's like I'm trying to convince myself.</i></font>

373
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know, I bet Selma was 
the most nervous of us all.</font>

374
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Was I? Because of Orhun?</i></font>

375
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, that's impossible!</i></font>

376
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's true that I like him as a person.</i></font>

377
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I look up to him as an adventurer.</i></font>

378
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But there's nothing more to it than that.</i></font>

379
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't... think there is...</i></font>

380
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I...</i></font>

381
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know...</font>

382
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're such a handsome man, Orhun.</font>

383
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is that how I really feel?</i></font>

384
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, no way.</i></font>

385
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sheesh...</i></font>

386
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's hard to focus.</i></font>

387
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, Selma.</font>

388
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I keep you waiting?</font>

389
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... I'm sorry.</font>

390
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About yesterday. I feel really bad.</font>

391
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you'd been drinking.</font>

392
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine.</font>

393
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's both forget it.</font>

394
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

395
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's focus on the future.</font>
