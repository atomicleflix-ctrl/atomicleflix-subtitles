42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We dealt with them.</font>

44
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't be serious.</font>

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We wouldn't have put Sooha

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that?!</font>

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jaan.</font>

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha, don't get too close to these guys.</font>

49
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,810

50
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. You should hang 
out with us next weekend.</font>

52
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha already agreed to hang 
out with us next weekend.</font>

53
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? I did?</font>

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Then let's meet up 
the weekend after that!</font>

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

56
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have plans that weekend 
and every weekend after.</font>

57
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forever and ever, never-ending!</font>

58
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit messing with me, brat!</font>

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that, idiot?!</font>

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up! Takes one to know one!</font>

61
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, Sooha, we really are throwing 
a birthday party three weeks from now.</font>

62
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll come, right?</font>

63
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? I-If it's someone's birthday, 
I'll definitely be there.</font>

64
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Don't lie to her!</font>

65
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true.</font>

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't believe me, 
why don't you come, too?</font>

67
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like hell I'm going!</font>

68
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not celebrating that!</font>

69
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm joking. I'd never invite you guys.</font>

70
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it'd be nice to
 celebrate together.</font>

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Sooha says so, then I'm going for sure.</font>

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too. Send me an invitation.</font>

73
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to go, too.</font>

74
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

75
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said I was joking!</font>

76
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way I'd ever invite you guys.</font>

77
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that?!</font>

78
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're offering to attend 
your boring little party!</font>

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough.</font>

80
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dusty losers aren't invited.</font>

81
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit it, guys.</font>

82
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha said she was attacked 
by vampires, right?</font>

83
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They put Sooha in danger.</font>

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

85
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two seem awfully
 concerned about Sooha.</font>

86
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh, yeah. I wonder why.</font>

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sense a strange power in her.</font>

88
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To tell you the truth, so do I.</font>

89
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

90
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha's words froze me in place then.</font>

91
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something up with her.</font>

92
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's related to 
today's vampire attack.</font>

93
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, and that's not all.</font>

94
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They may have been protecting Sooha,</font>

95
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm intrigued that they 
fought their own kind.</font>

96
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That person I saw at the plaza today...</i></font>

97
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If Chris had lived to be an adult, 
he definitely would've looked like that.</i></font>

98
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I thought Chris was dead.</font>

99
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha.</font>

100
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He definitely called my name back there.</i></font>

101
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is Chris actually still alive?</i></font>

102
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But how?</i></font>

103
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And why didn't he come see me sooner?</i></font>

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe he 
disappeared right away, too.</i></font>

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, none of that matters!</i></font>

106
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I only care that you're still alive!</i></font>

107
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris!</font>

108
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris!</font>

109
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris! Chris!</font>

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha, I missed you.</font>

111
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're alive?</font>

112
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I am.</font>

113
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really Chris?</font>

114
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, really. This brings back memories.</font>

115
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, you haven't changed a bit.</font>

116
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris...</font>

117
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are Chris!</font>

118
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad to see you again, Sooha.</font>

119
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris...</font>

120
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why?</font>

121
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A dream?</i></font>

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That must've been a dream.</i></font>

123
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I know.</i></font>

124
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's no way Chris will be there.</i></font>

125
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is all a dream.</i></font>

126
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it. He's not here.</font>

127
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is it so dark when
 there's a full moon tonight?</font>

128
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm the only one who 
didn't transform again.</i></font>

129
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why am I the only one who can't?</i></font>

130
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Everyone else naturally becomes a wolf 
under the light of the full moon,</i></font>

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so why not me?</i></font>

132
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Am I defective after all?</i></font>

133
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha?</font>

134
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khan?</font>

135
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khan.</font>

136
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

137
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And in pajamas?</i></font>

138
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh? What?</i></font>

139
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He seems different from usual.</i></font>

140
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I was in such a hurry, I didn't change!</font>

141
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Don't worry about it.</font>

142
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It happens when you're rushing.</font>

143
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heck, it happens to me all the time.</font>

144
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? All the time?</font>

145
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Anyway, what are you doing here?</font>

146
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

147
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, um... I-I just wanted 
to see the ocean at night.</font>

148
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By yourself?</font>

149
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I thought there was
 a full moon tonight.</font>

150
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a total eclipse.</font>

151
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the Sun, Earth, and Moon line up,
 the Moon is hidden in the Earth's shadow.</font>

152
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a really special day.</font>

153
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I learned about it, 
but this is my first time seeing it.</font>

154
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way...</font>

155
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

156
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... came to see the total eclipse.</font>

157
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

158
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By yourself? Where are the others?</font>

159
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just me. They're...</font>

160
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">asleep.</font>

161
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Listen, Sooha. Want me to walk you back?</font>

162
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

163
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some vampires showed up 
today, right? I'm worried.</font>

164
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure? Thanks.</font>

165
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was actually a little scared.</font>

166
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About the vampires, 
and about the stray dogs, too.</font>

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stray dogs?</font>

168
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Didn't you hear
 them howling just now?</font>

169
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Were they?</font>

170
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope they don't attack people.</font>

171
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't! Especially not wolves.</font>

172
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

173
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, I mean...</font>

174
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're, uh... surprisingly kind animals.</font>

175
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true. Plus, wolves are cool.</font>

176
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You really think so?</font>

177
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You like wolves, too?</font>

178
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! At least, I like seeing them on TV.</font>

179
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'd be scared if I ran into one.</font>

180
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

181
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well, I'll walk you back.</font>

182
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Thanks.</font>

183
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,040
<font face="Times New Roman" size="13"><b>{\an8}- Dark Moon: The Blood Altar -</b></font>

185
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jino, do you have any plans for today?</font>

186
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really.</font>

187
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you feel?</font>

188
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Normal?</font>

189
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Stare...</i></font>

190
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to practice shooting 
with you, right? I know.</font>

191
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never stop throwing balls around.</font>

192
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

193
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? He's not with you?</font>

194
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Shion said...</font>

195
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion.</font>

196
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so tired.</font>

197
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up?</font>

198
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't get to see Sooha.</font>

199
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. The birthday party.</font>

200
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no rush. 
You'll see her eventually, right?</font>

201
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't wait to give this to her.</font>

202
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wore myself out looking
 everywhere for her.</font>

203
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, yes. That must've been hard for you.</font>

204
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you're so tired, 
I'll give this to Sooha for you.</font>

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

206
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't, Jaan.</font>

207
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give it to her.</font>

208
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jino?</font>

209
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're gonna fight, I'll do it.</font>

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noa?</font>

211
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm concerned about your 
ability to deliver the invite.</font>

212
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I should do it.</font>

213
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You too, Jakah?!</font>

214
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

215
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, guys!</font>

216
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

217
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, sorry.</font>

218
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's strange, isn't it?</font>

219
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before we met Sooha, we always 
wanted to keep to ourselves.</font>

220
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

221
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd never thought about
 inviting someone else.</font>

222
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm excited for the party.</font>

223
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the more reason to make 
sure she gets the invitation.</font>

224
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

225
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I know where Sooha might be.</font>

226
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha.</font>

227
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heli.</font>

228
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here to borrow some books?</font>

229
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. What about you?</font>

230
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm returning a book today.</font>

231
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the book from the other day.</font>

232
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I finished it.</font>

233
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it interesting?</font>

234
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It's on legends from
 an ancient kingdom.</font>

235
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are vampires and werewolves in them.</font>

236
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires and werewolves...</font>

237
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're famous for being
 ancient mortal enemies.</font>

238
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They often appear together.</font>

239
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

240
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Werewolves turn into wolves 
during the full moon, right?</font>

241
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

242
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, there was 
a total eclipse yesterday.</font>

243
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

244
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe they can't transform during a full
 moon if a total eclipse conceals it.</font>

245
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure.</font>

246
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But apparently, werewolves fall in love</font>

247
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with the first woman they 
see during a total eclipse,</font>

248
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and will love that woman alone
for the rest of their life.</font>

249
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds lovely.</font>

250
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But eclipses are rare.</font>

251
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt they fall in love that way often.</font>

252
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true. Did you see the eclipse?</font>

253
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I was asleep.</font>

254
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you?</font>

255
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, at the inlet.</font>

256
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You went to
 the inlet after that? Why?</font>

257
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanted to see the ocean at night.</font>

258
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought there was a full moon last night 
and was surprised by how dark it was,</font>

259
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then Khan told me 
about the total eclipse.</font>

260
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We happened to meet by the sea.</font>

261
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You met Khan on the night
 of a total eclipse?</font>

262
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. What about it?</font>

263
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's nothing.</font>

264
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Invite me next time.</font>

265
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

266
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A shadow crossed his face for a moment.</i></font>

267
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Did he not like that I met up with Khan?</i></font>

268
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like looking at the sea at night, too.</font>

269
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

270
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Come to think of it, I wonder 
why they don't get along.</i></font>

271
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is it because they attend rival schools?</i></font>

272
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They said they compete for the 
nightball championship every year.</i></font>

273
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe they're on edge since 
they have a game coming up.</i></font>

274
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, that can't be helped.</i></font>

275
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, yesterday must've been tough.</font>

276
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh, yeah.</font>

277
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me know right away if 
anything unusual happens, okay?</font>

278
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This wasn't just a coincidence.</font>

279
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were targeting Sooha.</font>

280
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. I'm fine, though.</font>

281
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, have you gotten used to school?</font>

282
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. For the first time in my life, 
I think I'm having fun at school.</font>

283
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

284
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All because of you, Heli. Thank you.</font>

285
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to thank me.</font>

286
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just glad you're having fun.</font>

287
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're the reason I made friends with—</font>

288
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha.</font>

289
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jino.</font>

290
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you were at the library after all.</font>

291
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you both borrowing books?</font>

292
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Heli's returning one, actually.</font>

293
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I see.</font>

294
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all borrowing books, too?</font>

295
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course we are. Reading's my hobby.</font>

296
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came to borrow a book 
on quantum mechanics.</font>

297
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been interested in it lately.</font>

298
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop lying, you two.</font>

299
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noa, your book's upside down.</font>

300
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just thought you'd be here, Sooha.</font>

301
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aside from Heli, 
none of us really read much.</font>

302
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell her that.</font>

303
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I read three whole lines.</font>

304
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what were you talking about?</font>

305
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was asking Heli about the book he read.</font>

306
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said it was about an ancient kingdom.</font>

307
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are werewolves and 
vampires in the stories.</font>

308
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Werewolves?</font>

309
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Heli told me about 
a romantic werewolf legend.</font>

310
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What legend?</font>

311
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">During a total eclipse, werewolves fall 
in love with the first woman they see.</font>

312
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They love her and only her forever.</font>

313
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that so romantic?</font>

314
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please.</font>

315
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe so, but werewolves are just mutts.</font>

316
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. You have to deal with the 
shedding whenever they're around.</font>

317
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you'll never stop sneezing.</font>

318
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say they're part-human and part-wolf, 
but they're less than 10% human.</font>

319
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

320
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Solon? You're here?</font>

321
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:51,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah. Anyone who's half-stray dog
 is savage, stupid, and crude.</font>

322
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now. No need to go that far.</font>

323
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha thinks the werewolf 
legend is romantic.</font>

324
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About them falling in love with the first 
person they see during a total eclipse?</font>

325
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just werewolves being stupid.</font>

326
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires are far... better.</font>

327
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

328
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires don't feel any love at all.</font>

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, they don't even have 
the kind heart of a human.</font>

330
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just yesterday, they suddenly attacked me!</font>

331
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And... and...</font>

332
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they kill innocent people 
and turn them into vampires!</font>

333
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's no way they
 even know what love is.</font>

334
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires are just cold, brutal monsters!</font>

335
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Werewolves are way better!</font>

336
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you can't even compare them.</font>

337
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires are the worst!</font>

338
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sorry for flipping out so suddenly.</font>

339
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's fine.</font>

340
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We shouldn't have said 
those things to begin with.</font>

341
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah.</font>

342
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have nothing to apologize for, Sooha.</font>

343
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

344
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone has their own preferences.</font>

345
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

346
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just really hate vampires.</font>

347
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

348
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know. Everyone hates vampires.</font>

349
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Her friend was killed by a vampire.</font>

350
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. That's why she hates them so much.</font>

351
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not all.</font>

352
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know that incredible power she has?</font>

353
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean her super strength?</font>

354
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's been mistaken for 
a vampire because of it.</font>

355
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's probably suffered a lot for it.</font>

356
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what are we supposed to do?</font>

357
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't give this to her.</font>

358
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not even you could do it?</font>

359
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? I know how to read a room, okay?</font>

360
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe we can't invite her
 to our birthday party.</font>

361
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought there was a full moon last night
