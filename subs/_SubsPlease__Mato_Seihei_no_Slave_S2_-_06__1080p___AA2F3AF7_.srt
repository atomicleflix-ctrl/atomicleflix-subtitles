00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You earned the job with your tenacity!</font>

140
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Be proud of yourself!</font>

141
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, ma'am!</font>

142
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This isn't the Himari I know.</font>

143
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What you just said... Take it back.</font>

144
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I won't let anyone talk bad
about the commander.</font>

145
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I said it because you're weak, Himari.</font>

146
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If it upsets you,
then make me take it back.</font>

147
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Learning!</font>

148
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,880
<font size="27"><b>{\an7}Character Info</b></font>

149
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,880
<font size="27"><b>{\an7}*Commander*</b></font>

150
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,880
<font size="34"><b>{\an7}Yakumo Ezo</b></font>

151
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,880

152
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is that...</font>

153
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Commander Ezo's Night Storm?!</font>

154
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's your...</font>

155
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She copied Ame-no-Mitori?!</font>

156
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It isn't as accurate,
but it's suitable for battle.</font>

157
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This ability...</font>

158
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's Homare's Python!</font>

159
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Golden Hour!</font>

160
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll say it one more time: Take it back.</font>

161
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Does something about Himari seem strange?</font>

162
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's losing her cool.</font>

163
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A subconscious awakening on account
of her rage and the high-stakes situation.</font>

164
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Man, this is getting good!</font>

165
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Nobody gets to insult the commander!</font>

166
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I take back what I said
about Commander Uzen.</font>

167
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So come at me with everything you've got!</font>

168
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's right!</font>

169
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My commander...</font>

170
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's...</font>

171
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">the best...</font>

172
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">there is.</font>

173
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Looks like you're already at your limit.</font>

174
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But you showed me, Himari.</font>

175
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your potential.</font>

176
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well done, Himari.</font>

177
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Had you interfered,
we would have never known.</font>

178
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">From now on,
don't forget to take care of yourself.</font>

179
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maia had teamed up with Fubuki,</font>

180
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and Yachiho had participated
to support Himari.</font>

181
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The pair conceded,
and the Azuma Banquet came to a close.</font>

182
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fubuki became the next matriarch.</font>

183
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So in this game,</font>

184
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">when the gauge is maxed out,
you get to use a super special ability!</font>

185
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You can turn the tables
with a single move!</font>

186
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're very knowledgeable, Shikoku.</font>

187
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Playing that electronic thing again?</font>

188
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We're sampling human pastimes.</font>

189
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Before we destroy 'em.</font>

190
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, well, put it away.
Things are about to get busy for us.</font>

191
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gotcha!</font>

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Going somewhere, Big Sis Shikoku?</font>

193
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">To bring the eighth Thunder God to life.</font>

194
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's about time!</font>

195
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm getting awfully hungry.</font>

196
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Can you consume a third person?</font>

197
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yup!</font>

198
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I like eating the ones with abilities!</font>

199
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">'Cause that's how
they turn into my abilities.</font>

200
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And the two inside me
are going to love having a new friend!</font>

201
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm amazed that you can make room
every time you're hungry.</font>

202
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But absolutely no ugly prey allowed!</font>

203
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Kinda sucks that she adopts
their personalities, though.</font>

204
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Should we attack the Demon Defense Force
and abduct one of them?</font>

205
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's avoid the Demon Defense Force
until all eight of us are here.</font>

206
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In fact... I have a brilliant idea.</font>

207
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Big Sis Shikoku! Such a pretty smile!</font>

208
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I kept my mouth shut
'cause it would've killed the mood,</font>

209
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but I got the healing stuff locked down.</font>

210
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You used two commanders' abilities
in a row?!</font>

211
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's incredible!</font>

212
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah, but I can't recreate it now.</font>

213
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Golden Hour! Golden Hour!</font>

214
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That pose isn't cool enough, Himari!
Like this! See?</font>

215
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I thought I'd finally mastered Learning,
but if not, then...</font>

216
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Be patient, Himari.</font>

217
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If it's a compatibility problem,
we'll solve it with training!</font>

218
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I agree with Commander Uzen.</font>

219
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You discovered your strength,
and that's enough for now.</font>

220
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Work on figuring out
how to develop its potential.</font>

221
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You've grown into a fine Azuma!</font>

222
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's a little late for that.</font>

223
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So go and have a bunch of children
for the family's sake!</font>

224
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What?</font>

225
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I mean, you already have a man right here!</font>

226
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If you like, I can give a lecture
on how to conceive,</font>

227
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and I'll even let him sit in on it!</font>

228
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and I'll even let him sit in on it!</font>

229
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, uh... W-wait a minute.</font>

230
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How about it?</font>

231
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, uh... W-wait a minute.</font>

232
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's okay, I...</font>

233
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There it is. Overbearing old bag.</font>

234
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Once she starts talking,
there's no stopping her.</font>

235
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mother.</font>

236
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What?</font>

237
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Would you kindly shut up?</font>

238
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come again?</font>

239
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fubuki?</font>

240
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We have you to thank for
making our household stronger than ever.</font>

241
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">However...</font>

242
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A performance-based system
encourages relentless competition,</font>

243
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">even amongst the children,
and promotes familial conflict.</font>

244
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The children aren't being brought up
with a healthy mindset anymore.</font>

245
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Furthermore,</font>

246
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">a matriarch who acts high and mighty</font>

247
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">while cosplaying as
an ordinary member of the family</font>

248
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">because it requires less effort</font>

249
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">is not indicative
of a functional organization!</font>

250
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I would ask that you refrain</font>

251
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">from wandering about outside
in a school uniform!</font>

252
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You need to grow up!</font>

253
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then again,
I suppose I can overlook that part.</font>

254
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Who the hell do you think-</font>

255
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I am the head of the Azuma Family now.</font>

256
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You would've effortlessly countered
an attack like that</font>

257
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">back in your
Supreme Commander days, Mother.</font>

258
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're getting careless.</font>

259
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If you can't keep up with the times,
I will dispose of you.</font>

260
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fubuki, you bitch.</font>

261
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You got stronger.</font>

262
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">From here on out,
I'm in charge of the household.</font>

263
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fine, suit yourself.</font>

264
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I will.</font>

265
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">An Azuma should be powerful.</font>

266
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That principle will remain,
and I will create a new family.</font>

267
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">From now on,
let's try and get along better.</font>

268
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Uh, okay...</font>

269
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Homare and Yumina.</font>

270
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm going to retrain you
from the inside out.</font>

271
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Lovingly, of course.</font>

272
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Blegh!</font>

273
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Commander Izumo, I look forward
to our long-lasting friendship.</font>
