<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whew!</font>

00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's getting real hot out here. 
I'll do one more song and call it a day.</font>

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want AKP48!</font>

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The crowd's clearly gotten 
bigger after sports day.</font>

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a real chance that she'll beat 
yours truly in terms of popularity.</font>

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said,</font>

a street performance.</font>

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is she actually writing any songs?</font>

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgot her lyrics?</font>

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably broke a guitar string.</font>

20

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, that's all for today. 
See you next time.</font>

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aww...</font>

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I talk to you for a second?</font>

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello? Can you not hear me?</font>

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Yamabuki, and you?</font>

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, okay, I'm sorry for 
ignoring you! So don't do it!</font>

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you can see me.</font>

29
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was afraid I'd died and become a ghost.</font>

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you ignore me?</font>

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you seemed annoying.</font>

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rest assured, for I am anything but. 
In fact, allow me to list ten reasons why.</font>

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-So you are annoying!</font>

34
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanted to ask you why 
you seemed so put off back there.</font>

35
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there something you didn't like 
about Inohana's show?</font>

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, what do you think?</font>

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About her show, I mean.</font>

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think she's doing pretty well.</font>

39
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She has her finger on the pulse 
of what songs are popular,</font>

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and she's good at copying 
the originals' singing styles.</font>

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... she does seem 
to get self-conscious.</font>

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what that means?</font>

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the songs that are popular, not her. 
Anybody else could cover them.</font>

44
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She wasn't like this before...</font>

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you a friend of hers?</font>

46
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy now?</font>

47
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really.</font>

48
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me ask you a couple more questions.</font>

49
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,670

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your old friend told me. 
I actually know her, too.</font>

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know Aiko?!</font>

64
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, so her name is Aiko?</font>

65
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was quite the handful. 
She wouldn't even give me her name.</font>

67
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She looked really bored 
as she watched your show,</font>

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I had a little chat with her.</font>

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did she say?</font>

70
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your expression tells me 
you already have a good idea.</font>

71
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

72
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aiko hates me for only doing 
covers of popular songs.</font>

73
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because she loved the songs I wrote.</font>

74
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then just perform 
original songs at your shows.</font>

75
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't wanna.</font>

76
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not...</font>

77
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not telling you. 
It's something I'm embarrassed about.</font>

80
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a karaoke room.</font>

You really don't intend to tell me!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's one you sang in your show yesterday. 
No objections there, right?</font>

92
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's fine by me.</font>

93
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,220

97
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I said, it's a handicap.</font>

105
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get self-conscious and give off that

157
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

158
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The band logo on your shirt.</font>

159
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you like that band?</font>

160
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, this? Yeah, I like 'em.</font>

161
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the band Rikka loved.</font>

168
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll tell you why

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said whoever does better wins.</font>

171

Your song was better.</font>

172
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,610

173
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you really hate losing.</font>

174
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stuff happened in my past,</font>

175
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and now I can't sing my 
original songs in front of people.</font>

176
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Elaborate.</font>

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm scared.</font>

178
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of the looks people give me when 
they judge me or think I'm a letdown.</font>

179
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Covers are much easier because I can 
hide behind other people's music.</font>

180
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How cowardly, right?</font>

181
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see. She's scared of the 
audience's judgmental eyes?</i></font>

182
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A straightforward trauma, 
and a critical one.</i></font>

183
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If it's not resolved at once, 
she has no future.</i></font>

184
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been trying to write a new song,</font>

185
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but remembering those eyes 
stops me dead in my tracks.</font>

186
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's affecting her songwriting, too.</i></font>

187
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What should I do?</i></font>

188
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right. We'll just have to 
do this the Yamabuki way.</i></font>

189
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're scared of having eyes on you?</font>

190
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to be that way, too.</font>

191
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know that's my tea, right?</font>

192
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to take part in numerous 
extracurricular activities.</font>

193
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Presentations and speeches 
were part of that.</font>

194
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The piercing gaze of the audience 
is something I know all too well.</font>

195
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you get over your fear?</font>

196
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you can't write a new song,</font>

197
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you still have your old ones, right?</font>

198
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? I guess?</font>

199
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then it's clear what we must do.</font>

200
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll do an "Inohana Rikka 
Original Songs School Concert."</font>

201
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha?</font>

202
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just have to get used to it. 
Experience is everything.</font>

203
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll arrange a venue 
and an audience.</font>

204
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't decide for me!</font>

205
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't have to be a new song, 
but you can only perform your own songs.</font>

206
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think you're being 
a bit insensitive?</font>

207
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is normal for the Yamabuki family. 
Even you should be able to do it.</font>

208
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, fine.</font>

209
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent. Now, as for when...</font>

210
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll do the concert a week from now!</font>

211
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The school rooftop? 
Why not my usual spot?</i></font>

212
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought you'd understand how I feel, 
but I guess I was wrong.</i></font>

213
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In the end, you're not mediocre like me.</i></font>

214
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Are you the same as that guy?</i></font>

215
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you'd be up for it.</font>

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I expected too much of you.</font>

217
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Yamabuki-kun. 
I really don't think I can...</font>

218
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you're finally here.</font>

219
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rooftop scary!</font>

220
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We get to hear your original song 
after so long, Rikka-chan!</font>

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

222
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Why are you all here? 
Where are the other spectators?</font>

223
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just the four of us.</font>

224
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you really think 
I'd throw you to the wolves?</font>

225
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to get used to 
the audience's gaze,</font>

226
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you start with friends and family.</font>

227
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,880

if we could help you overcome it.</font>

228
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll watch you 
with the clearest of eyes.</font>

229
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We get VIP seats! That's so cool!</font>

230
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Relax. I've locked the door.</font>

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have nothing but allies here.

236
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't even know what to say.</font>

316

317
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this a bit too showy?</font>

367
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,280

What flavor did you get?</font>

371
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Salt and green onions, why?</font>

Do you like mentai mayo that much?</font>

376
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,750

377
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,820

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else am I supposed to do? 
We only have this one toothpick.</font>

382
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,920

383
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,910

387
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,170

389
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,980

Thank you for the takoyaki!</font>

390
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,250

a bit more flustered, y'know.</font>

391
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,200

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're doing karaoke instead!</font>

395
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So loud!</font>

396
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The lighting's so lewd.</font>

397
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}This place has great honey tea.</font>

398
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Now you'll have no choice 
but to deepen your bonds.</font>

399
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}They've always been deep.</font>

400
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Anyway...</font>

401
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're back at karaoke again?</font>

402
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you enjoy our little 
karaoke date that much?</font>

403
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Player.</font>

404
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gigolo.</font>

405
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Manwhore.</font>

406
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did nothing to warrant such slander.</font>

407
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go first, then.</font>

408
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will you sing?</font>

409
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I liked it when you sang this 
the other day, so this is payback.</font>

410
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}A BUS WON'T TAKE US TO THE MOON</font>

411
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, this song?</i></font>

412
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Listen, Arisu! I found this amazing band!</i></font>

413
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}I'm not a special person</i></font>

414
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Liking the same color 
and flavor is one thing,</i></font>

415
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but can you just happen to like the same 
niche band that broke up years ago?</i></font>

416
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}I'm well aware of that</i></font>

417
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}That's why, whenever we talk</i></font>

418
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is this some kind of message?</i></font>

419
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Inohana, are you actually...</i></font>

420
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}I give you the cold shoulder</i></font>

421
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}And now I don't know if that's okay</i></font>

422
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

423
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}If that's okay</i></font>

425
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}And now I'm worried</i></font>

426
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, whoa, whoa! Pause!</font>

427
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,590

428
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Yep.</font>

429
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We all love them.</font>

430
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've even played their songs 
during lunchtime broadcasts.</font>

431
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they're such a niche band!</font>
