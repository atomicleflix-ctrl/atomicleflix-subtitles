00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My third royal order has more

27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, Aresh-sama, 
I have work for you.</font>

28
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Work?</font>

29
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since civil officials couldn't come,
 I'm short on manpower.</font>

30
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be all set with the third

31
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it! I wasn't informed of this!</font>

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it you're planning?!</font>

33
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

34
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I discussed everything with 
Assistant Director Ist beforehand.</font>

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that true, Ist?!</font>

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, perhaps?</font>

37
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ist!</font>

41
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As we need people highly practiced 
with magical energy and in magic studies,</font>

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this could only be handled by 
the royal sorcery department.</font>

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Accordingly, we'll grant special 
compensation for the job.</font>

44
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can a mere assistant director of 
accounting decide something like that?</font>

45
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, rest assured.</font>

46
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both my director and His Excellency
have already signed off on it.</font>

47
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed...</font>

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That should be enough 
for their department.</i></font>

49
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll have Director Zoltan,

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>instruct the others while Ist-san selects
 members more resistant to magicules.</i></font>

51
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, I'd like everyone
of the third royal order...</font>

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Halt.</font>

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On whose authority are you
 doing whatever you please?</font>

54
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Excellency the Prime Minister.</font>

55
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a letter here entrusting 
this matter to me.</font>

56
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in charge of this 
purification expedition!</font>

57
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, which is why this was entrusted
 to me as a separate affair.</font>

58
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A separate affair?</font>

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness,
 you should see to reassuring</font>

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her Holiness and getting her 
somewhere to rest.</font>

61
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'd like to stay behind 
with you, Kondou-san!</font>

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yua?</font>

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Has she only now realized 
the dangers of this world</i></font>

64
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and the precariousness 
of her own position?</i></font>

65
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Still, there's nothing I can 
do for her right now.</i></font>

66
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem quite tired, Your Holiness.</font>

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please return to the town we set out 
from this morning and get some rest.</font>

68
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what is it you intend to do?</font>

69
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

70
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I said, I'm in charge here.</font>

71
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The damage from the miasma is
the most pressing issue in our kingdom.</font>

72
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't leave matters to an 
otherworlder who knows nothing.</font>

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh?</i></font>

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>As a prince of this kingdom,</i></font>

75
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>it at least appears he's strongly 
motivated regarding the miasma.</i></font>

76
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, Your Highness, please stand back 
with your guard to observe at a distance.</font>

77
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiichirou, what should the knights do?</font>

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please protect the members 
of the royal sorcery department</font>

79
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and record the details
 of the barrier they cast.</font>

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Barrier? What are you going to protect?</font>

81
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to protect this kingdom.</font>

82
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What nonsense are you spouting?</font>

83
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Barrier spells are a complex form of magic
 that only a select few can use.</font>

84
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A barrier large enough
 to cover the entire kingdom</font>

85
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would require far more 
sorcerers than we have.</font>

86
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right, Zoltan?</font>

87
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Your Highness. We only have eight
 here capable of casting the spell.</font>

88
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need only think of it 
the other way around.</font>

89
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know the root of the miasma,
so we just need to shift our perspective.</font>

90
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can simply seal the source.</font>

91
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's begin.</font>

92
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we cast a barrier approximately three 
meters in radius around the tree</font>

93
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and determine the concentration 
of miasma inside...</font>

94
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we plant various flora
 around the area</font>

95
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to document how long it takes 
for the barrier to weaken, huh?</font>

96
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not a permanent spell, after all.</font>

98
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the end, once Shiraishi-san 
finishes the purification,</font>

99
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll cast the barrier again,
station guards around the forest,</font>

100
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and have the spell reinforced regularly
to prevent any miasma leakage.</font>

101
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meanwhile, if we find a way to eliminate
 the source of the miasma itself...</font>

102
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd never even considered something 
like this before you suggested it.</font>

103
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably because of the holy maiden.</font>

104
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Few bother to consider other 
more time-consuming solutions</font>

105
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when an easy one is available to them.</font>

106
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's intellectual laziness.</font>

107
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, well, there won't be a need</font>

108
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to summon holy maidens from 
another world with this method.</font>

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basically, I'm telling the kingdom
 it should wipe its own ass.</font>

110
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Granted, the holy maiden is 
a symbol of hope to the people</i></font>

111
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and an ace up the kingdom's sleeve.</i></font>

112
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Convincing the king that one is no longer
 necessary will take more work...</i></font>

113
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama, I still have 
a lot of work to do.</font>

114
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Save it for later.</font>

115
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were exposed to miasma today.</font>

116
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to reinforce your barrier.</font>

117
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>True. Even the knights with high magicule 
resistance were feeling unwell,</i></font>

118
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>yet I was fine thanks to the barrier.</i></font>

119
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't thank him enough,</i></font>

120
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but...</i></font>

121
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder when it started.</i></font>

122
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've grown aware of his feelings,</i></font>

123
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but right now...</i></font>

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama, do we need to go this far?</font>

125
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We do.</font>

126
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We really don't, do we?</font>

127
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:19,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We need physical contact to familiarize me

128
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,280

129
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kondu, you here?</font>

130
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in the middle of something. Leave.</font>

131
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I sensed the commander's magical

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's nothing left for me
once that's over, right?!</font>

261
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please send me back to my own world!</font>

262
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you saying, Yua?</font>

263
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're our one and only holy maiden.</font>

264
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even after the purification is complete, 
our kingdom will cherish you dearly.</font>

265
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why?</font>

266
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wasn't I summoned to 
perform the purification?</font>

267
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't need me after that's done.</font>

268
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true.</font>

269
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The very presence of the holy maiden 
guides our kingdom to prosperity.</font>

270
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">K-Kondou-san!</font>

271
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I mentioned earlier, I believe 
the role of holy maiden</font>

272
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will no longer be necessary 
in the future.</font>

273
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:32,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, at present, there is no way
 for us to return to our original world.</font>

274
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way... No...</font>

275
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yua!</font>

276
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way... No!</font>

277
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Mom! Dad! Big Brother! I miss them...</font>

278
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Holiness, the holy maiden 
is vital to our world!</font>

279
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I want to see them! Send me back!
 Let me go back home!</font>

280
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, allow me to distribute 
the next document.</font>

281
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell are you saying?!</font>

282
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of you, the holy 
maiden is in distress!</font>

283
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're the ones who dragged 
her here against her will</i></font>

284
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>with nothing but the clothes on her back.</i></font>

285
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please excuse me for standing.</font>

286
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I just said,</font>

287
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we have no way to get home after
the parallel world summoning spell.</font>

288
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, we were summoned here via</font>

289
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">methods developed by 
studying magical technology.</font>

290
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Therefore, with further research, 
there may be a way to send us back.</font>

291
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What are you...</font>

292
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You stand before the king!</font>

293
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The parallel world summoning spell
uses the magic of the royal family,</font>

294
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who can connect to parallel 
worlds through divine revelation,</font>

295
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">allowing us to accurately 
summon the holy maiden.</font>

296
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER</font>

297
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, as for sending her back,
though we have the original coordinates,</font>

298
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the possibility of dimensional warping 
may send her to a totally different world.</font>

299
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I told you so many times 
to watch your words!</font>

300
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I will distribute simplified 
documents I have prepared.</font>

301
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To stop that, we'd need a pool of 
magical energy not currently possible.</font>

302
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A proposal to expand the 
royal sorcery department?</font>

303
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In summary,</font>

304
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we have decided to start a research 
project under the royal sorcery department</font>

305
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that aims to return two people, including 
Her Holiness, to their original world.</font>

306
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Additionally, the proposal I've prepared
factors in the personnel required</font>

307
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for monitoring the miasma.</font>

308
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How dare you try to interfere 
with palace personnel?!</font>

309
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. Regarding that, I reviewed and 
approved the proposal in advance.</font>

310
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-If it's magic, the third 
royal order would be more—</font>

311
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our order focuses on
practical applications</font>

312
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">such as dealing with magic 
beasts, not research.</font>

313
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are knights, not scholars.</font>

314
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have various expeditions and cannot 
allocate troops to monitor the miasma.</font>

315
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}DENIED.</font>

317
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just a normal person who followed
 the holy maiden of your own accord!</font>

318
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're already providing your livelihood,
 yet you still demand more?!</font>

319
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With all due respect,</font>

320
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am not demanding you return us safely 
using a vast amount of national funds.</font>

321
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Instead, I'm proposing a new system that 
doesn't involve summoning a holy maiden</font>

322
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while also promoting new magic research 
within the originally allocated budget.</font>

323
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:18,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such research should benefit
 other research projects, as well.</font>

324
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right, Director Zoltan?</font>

325
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

326
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we can establish a method 
for stabilizing dimensions</font>

327
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and ensuring safe warping 
to target coordinates,</font>

328
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it will greatly advance the 
research of relocation magic...</font>

329
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right! Relocation magic!</font>

330
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER BLABBER</font>

331
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until now, it's required a magic circle
 and sorcerer on both ends,</font>

332
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it couldn't be used 
for living creatures.</font>

333
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Director Zoltan. Please take away Ist-san.</font>

334
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we can implement a return spell, 
that'd be possible!</font>

335
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meaning we could use it for rescue and...</font>

336
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yes.</font>

337
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, with your proposal,</font>

338
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we trade the legend of the holy maiden
 for advanced magical technology.</font>

339
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is exactly right.</font>

340
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Technological innovation 
and breakthroughs,</font>

341
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">along with the development of skilled 
personnel, will spearhead progress.</font>

342
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Furthermore, the budget for this 
 is all covered by the funds</font>

343
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">previously allocated to combating miasma,</font>

344
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so there's no additional 
financial burden to the kingdom.</font>

345
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, Kondou-san!</font>

346
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What... What should I do until then?</font>

347
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe it would be best for you to stay
here until you finish the purification.</font>

348
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's the best option when considering</i></font>

349
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>expedition preparations, her well-being,
and the exhaustion of the purification.</i></font>

350
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And after that...</font>

351
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I do after I 
finish purifying the miasma?</font>

352
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you wish to do, Shiraishi-san?</font>

353
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to leave the royal palace.</font>

354
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can't accept money 
if I don't do anything...</font>

355
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to work at the same 
place you do, Kondou-san!</font>

356
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me a break.</font>

357
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

358
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing...</font>

359
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would be better to use your 
powers as the holy maiden.</font>

360
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, why not find a place 
that can utilize your special skills?</font>

361
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps a clinic or a church.</font>

363
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you want to leave the palace?</font>

364
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are the holy maiden.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you return to your world,</font>

366
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it won't diminish your great

367
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,900
