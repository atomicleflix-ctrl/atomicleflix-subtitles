00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, luckiest kid in the 
world who got to become my student.</font>

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello, my beloved master!</font>

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't hold back on you.</font>

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you ready?</font>

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, please!</font>

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I welcome any difficult training!</font>

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you hold back, I'll cry.</font>

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what do we start with?</font>

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A three-dimensional magic circle?</font>

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or an oblique magic circle?</font>

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My request is the 50-section 
compound spell!</font>

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}INCREDIBLE TRAINING
AND INCREDIBLE RESULTS</font>

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

14
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, thanks for the help.</font>

15
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was looking for someone who can 
make clean copies of my memos.</font>

16
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of these?</font>

17
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there'll be more.</font>

18
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you love me anymore?</font>

19
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never have.</font>

20
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So merciless and cool!</font>

21
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These here are state secrets.</font>

22
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stay outside until he's done.</font>

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Your Highness.</font>

24
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't worry about me.</font>

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm rooting for you.</font>

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, make me that thing.</font>

28
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master sure loves this thing.</font>

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

30
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall I make you some tea?</font>

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a favor to ask of you.</font>

32
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sword training?</font>

33
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

34
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only just begun, 
and I have much to improve.</font>

35
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to practice whenever 
I have spare time.</font>

36
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please do not tell Kunon about this!</font>

37
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Your Highness.</font>

38
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me!</font>

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I must become someone
suitable for Kunon.</i></font>

40
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A diagram?</font>

41
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you done yet?</font>

42
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About halfway.</font>

43
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're slow.</font>

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say that with such luminous skin.</font>

45
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm exhausted from trying 
to decipher your scrawls.</font>

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My memos, you mean.</font>

47
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This letter looks just like an 
earthworm writhing by the wayside</font>

48
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because it carelessly came out 
of the comfort of damp ground.</font>

49
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you compare my wisdom 
with a hopeless situation.</font>

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I send you an invoice for my work?</font>

51
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop complaining.</font>

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is significant training, all right?</font>

53
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Information and knowledge are different.</font>

54
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you can gain from 
reading is just information.</font>

55
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you analyze in your head 
and write with your own hand,</font>

56
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">your body remembers.</font>

57
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It becomes knowledge that's wildly 
different from information.</font>

58
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And knowledge becomes power.</font>

59
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's my master! I love you!</font>

60
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See ya. Make sure to finish 
everything by next time.</font>

61
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

62
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, there was a memo of a diagram.</font>

63
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it some sort of spell?</font>

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one... It'll be quicker to show you.</font>

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next time, you come to me.</font>

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Okay.</font>

67
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy that I get to see you often,
thanks to Master visiting me here!</font>

68
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same here.</font>

69
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't confuse the means with the end.</font>

70
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Kunon.</font>

71
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you grow taller?</font>

72
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I'm ten years old now.</font>

73
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A growth spurt.</font>

74
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your magical power has 
become a bit stronger, too.</font>

75
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that true?</font>

76
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna do another magic battle with me?</font>

77
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way!</font>

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kunon promised that he'd do a 
flying magic experiment with me.</font>

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's my turn.</font>

80
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all get out of my way.</font>

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's here to see me.</font>

82
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're monopolizing him again?!</font>

83
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not fair!</font>

84
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Follow me.</font>

85
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

86
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he taking Kunon to that room?!</font>

87
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mustn't go!</font>

88
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That place is the world of demons!</font>

89
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make that thing, now.</font>

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what magic tools are, right?</font>

91
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. They're tools that work with 
a sorcerer's magical power.</font>

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. For example, this lamp 
is a magic tool of fire.</font>

93
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magical engineers are sorcerers who 
make their living by creating magic tools.</font>

94
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magical engineers.</font>

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow! It's amazing!</font>

96
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are all of these your scrawls, Master?</font>

97
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean memos.</font>

98
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a spell I've never tried out.</font>

99
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted this grimoire so much</font>

100
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that I tried to rely on Father's 
collusion with His Majesty!</font>

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master, I want to live here!</font>

102
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to use 
collusion or live here.</font>

103
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eventually you can have it all.</font>

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master! I love you!</font>

105
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the magic tool 
I'm developing right now.</font>

106
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's what was in the diagram.</font>

107
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

108
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When it's completed, you can eat 
a piping-hot meal in your own room</font>

109
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without going to the kitchen.</font>

110
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can bake an apple pie in your room?</font>

111
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's nice!</font>

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My earth magic is good 
for modeling shapes,</font>

113
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the fine details and 
soft parts are not so easy.</font>

114
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soft parts... Do you think 
my water magic can make them?</font>

115
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You pick up quickly.</font>

116
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eventually, you'll help with my work, 
which will double as experiments.</font>

117
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds fun!</font>

118
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

119
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kunon Gurion!</font>

120
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello, Grand Master.</font>

121
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been waiting for you!</font>

122
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As promised, why don't we discuss 
the essence of magic over lunch?</font>

123
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make that thing.</font>

124
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My earth magic can take care of 
reinforcing the outer frame, but...</font>

125
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed. And water magic might be better 
for the small internal mechanism.</font>

126
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My goodness, Kunon's 
bed is nice, very nice.</font>

127
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Kunon.</font>

128
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want to change your teacher, 
don't hesitate to speak up.</font>

129
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm being worked to the bone, 
but he's a wonderful master.</font>

130
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And water and earth are quite compatible.</font>

131
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't have asked anyone better, 
and I'm grateful to the Grand Master.</font>

132
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's quite enough.</font>

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you embarrassed because your 
beloved student admires you?</font>

134
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right. Let us show 
them how close we are!</font>

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, really...?</font>

136
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For my personal safety, stop it.</font>

137
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about Her Highness?</font>

138
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I'm here, I'd love 
to have some tea with her.</font>

139
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mirika is at the entrance ceremony 
of the senior school for nobles today.</font>

140
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was very disappointed 
she couldn't see you.</font>

141
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, her higher education has started.</font>

142
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what do you plan to do?</font>

143
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's necessary, 
I'll take the graduation exam.</font>

144
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean the magic school.</font>

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The magic school?</font>

146
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a school where bright sorcerers from 
all over the world attend and learn.</font>

147
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the Royal Sorcerers here 
are graduates of that school.</font>

148
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to be twelve or older to enroll.</font>

149
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still have time, 
but give it some thought.</font>

150
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A school where sorcerers from 
all over the world attend...</font>

151
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}TWO YEARS LATER</font>

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

153
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Compound spell, 55 sections!</font>

154
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good!</font>

155
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did it.</font>

156
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

157
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's right out of the oven and so tasty!</font>

158
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This magic tool is quite popular,</font>

159
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm sure quite a bit of money 
is going into Master's pocket.</font>

160
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only Master's pocket.</font>

161
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I get paid for my work after all?</font>

162
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I allowed you to do 
experiments money can't buy.</font>

163
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll support your livelihood,
 Master Kunon.</font>

164
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know your talent better than anyone.</font>

165
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sound like the lover of 
a struggling stage actor.</font>

166
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you abandon me 
when you're successful?</font>

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will never do that.</font>

168
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm devoted to you.</font>

169
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get married in the future.</font>

170
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, so monotonous.</font>

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds fake.</font>

172
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've collaborated on seven 
magic tools already, right?</font>

173
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. And five papers on 
new theories on magic.</font>

174
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We also made a manual 
for magic experiments,</font>

175
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we're currently working 
on another magic tool.</font>

176
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can do the rest by myself.</font>

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

178
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we're codeveloping the Chest 
that Draws in a Bunch of Bugs.</font>

179
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Bunch of" sounds unprofessional.</font>

180
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call it the Insects Box.</font>

181
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are we completing the 
Bunch of Insects Box?</font>

182
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said no "bunch of."</font>

183
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're turning twelve this
 spring, aren't you?</font>

184
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Yes.</font>

185
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you to get ready 
to go to the magic school.</font>

186
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The magic school?</font>

187
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to go.</font>

188
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

189
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need to go, because 
I have you, Master.</font>

190
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to learn magic by your 
side and get worked to the bone!</font>

191
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've finished making the clean copies</font>

192
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">of my memos and blueprints 
of magic tools, right?</font>

193
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're abandoning me because I'm done?</font>

194
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not playing along.</font>

195
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm an earth sorcerer.</font>

196
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't teach water magic.</font>

197
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I want you to...</font>

198
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What if there's an extraordinary 
water sorcerer at the magic school?</font>

199
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world is much bigger than Hughlia.</font>

200
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An extraordinary water sorcerer...</font>

201
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Three-star, or if you're 
lucky, maybe even four-star.</font>

202
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... I...</font>

203
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please go.</font>

204
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And become an amazing sorcerer.</font>

205
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll become a fine woman who is 
worthy of you and wait for you.</font>

206
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness.</font>

207
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

208
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will go to the magic school.</font>

209
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

210
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is it?</font>

211
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! That far?! I change my mind!</font>

212
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up! Go!</font>

213
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What exactly do I need to do to 
prepare for the magic school?</font>

214
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I take a change of clothes
and the pillow I use every day?</font>

215
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have something much more important.</font>

216
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do! A gentleman's sense of humor!</font>

217
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could have said my 
lessons or something.</font>

218
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your eyes.</font>

219
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yes. That's right.</i></font>

220
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon?</font>

221
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How did I forget?</i></font>

222
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My biggest ambition, my fervent wish...</i></font>

223
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The most important 
purpose that I live for!</i></font>

224
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's because I've learned to do 
so many things without seeing.</i></font>

225
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Somewhere in my heart, I felt 
I could just go on like this.</i></font>

226
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm such a fool!</font>

227
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate it! I can't do this!</font>

228
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You played it cool in 
front of your boyfriend,</font>

229
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so stop crying already, 
you pain in the— Ouch!</font>

230
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In the last two years, Kunon has 
built his track record as a sorcerer.</i></font>

231
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If he gains sight through his magic,</i></font>

232
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>he'll go down in history as the first person</i></font>

233
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to have achieved such a feat.</i></font>

234
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If he goes far away,
I might get left behind.</i></font>

235
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir Dario.</font>

236
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

237
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Part of me can't help but wish that 
Kunon's eyes will never see,</font>

238
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so that he'll stay by my side.</font>

239
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am a despicable woman.</font>

240
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you are—</font>

241
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>

242
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many times do you have to do that?</font>

243
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can voluntarily shut up, 
or I can shut you up. It's your choice.</font>

244
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness, there's light 
and darkness in our hearts.</font>

245
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But please don't get swallowed by 
either and choose the right path.</font>

246
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir Dario.</font>

247
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will be fine.</font>

248
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you've been training for the 
last two years isn't just your body.</font>

249
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

250
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you too lenient on your student?</font>

251
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're too strict with your student.</font>

252
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You drive him into the ground 
and then abandon him in the end?</font>

253
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The compound spell of 55 sections, the three-dimensional magic circle,</font>

254
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the anchored cylindrical magic 
circle, imaginary codes,</font>

255
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">rheologic sand patterns,
and magic tools. I taught him all of those!</font>

256
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't I the best master there is?</font>

257
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Master Kunon uses those, 
will his eyes be complete?</font>

258
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No idea.</font>

259
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me that you just 
fed him a bunch of nonsense...</font>

260
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch it! Your darkness is showing!</font>

261
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even I've never heard 
of how to make eyeballs.</font>

262
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From here on, it's up to Kunon.</font>

263
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've no doubt he'll do it.</font>

264
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, he's my beloved 
student I'm proud of.</font>

265
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

266
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A mirror that reflects everything.</i></font>

267
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Master said that the eye of an insect is 
a cluster of over ten thousand mirrors.</i></font>

268
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But even if they reflect a whole lot, 
nothing transmits to me.</font>

269
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,450

271
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm...</font>

272
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of these is it.</font>

273
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing in 
the middle of the night?</font>

274
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come join me in the sauna.</font>

275
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure! Did you invite Father?</font>

276
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd hate to wake him up.</font>

277
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's worse not to wake him up!</font>

278
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Father absolutely adores 
the sauna you create.</font>

279
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, is it sauna time?</font>

280
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shh, you'll wake Mother.</font>

281
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's worse not to wake her up.</font>

282
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

283
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, that hits the spot!</font>

284
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ale is the best!</font>

285
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a good, manly drinker she is.</font>

286
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I love you.</font>

287
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the best way to refresh.</font>

288
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be a real challenge 
if you're stuck.</font>

289
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the biggest experiment 
I've done so far.</font>

290
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your eyeballs?</font>

291
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm nowhere near close.</font>

292
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you need a breather 
again, let me know anytime.</font>

293
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Know that I am at your disposal.</font>

294
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

295
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Everyone's so good to me.</i></font>

296
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't want to see their faces.</i></font>

297
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What do their faces look like?</i></font>

298
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to see what they see.</i></font>

299
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-rubu.</font>

301
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The core is the water mirror.</i></font>

302
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I applied a rheologic sand 
pattern on the surface</i></font>

303
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so that the pattern could read the 
moving view and send it to my mind.</i></font>

304
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

305
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's no complex configuration 
or relaying mechanism.</i></font>

306
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All I had to do was to think simple, 
without worrying about numbers and range.</i></font>

307
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see.</font>

308
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is the view.</font>

309
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is vision.</font>

310
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it.</font>

311
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see. I can see. I did it.</font>

312
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made eyeballs with magic!</font>

313
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

314
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>
