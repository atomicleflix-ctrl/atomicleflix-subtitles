<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Phew.</font>

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There.</font>

3
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's it!</font>

4
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, okay. So that's how 
you write "mushroom."</font>

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hello. I'm a magician's 
apprentice. My name is Lizel.</i></font>

7
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize?</font>

8
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. Coming!</font>

9
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Whoops! It's actually Lize.</i></font>

10
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,380

13
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's the key that unlocks my magic, so 
right now I should only say it in my mind.</i></font>

14
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stir what's in that pot for me.</font>

15
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

16
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But use your magic to do it.</font>

17
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

18
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is my mentor, the black witch Luna.</i></font>

21
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was writing in my diary just 
like you told me to, Miss Witch.</font>

22
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't understand magic language, 
so I was a little nervous at first,</font>

23
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but now that I can write what 
I'm thinking with thoughtography,</font>

24
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a lot of fun guessing which 
words have what letters in them.</font>

25
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm starting to really enjoy it. 
I'm learning a lot, so I'm glad I started!</font>

26
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. What? It's hot!</font>

27
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But to tell the truth, Miss Witch...</i></font>

28
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>doesn't seem to be very 
good at staying irritated.</i></font>

29
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, you really don't need to 
do all this. I'll be fine.</font>

30
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Whatever do you mean?</font>

31
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't know why, but she always 
seems to have her hands full.</i></font>

32
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can do that.</font>

33
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I've decided to do it myself.</font>

34
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lize kind of sounds like a girl's name, 
so I don't actually like it that much.</i></font>

35
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But it's the name that Miss Witch 
gave me, so it's very precious to me...</i></font>

36
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though she only 
took the "L" off the end?</font>

37
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's precious about it? 
That's about as lazy as you can get.</font>

38
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good afternoon.</font>

39
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph.</font>

40
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This huge grouch's name is Claude.</i></font>

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He always barges in here</i></font>

42
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to grumble about something 
when he's not even invited.</i></font>

43
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He really bugs me.</i></font>

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, he's always crowing about 
stuff, so maybe he "birds" me?</i></font>

45
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Still, he has the personality 
of a maggot, so...</i></font>

46
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

47
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah, let's say he bugs me.</i></font>

48
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll kick your ass, you little brat!</font>

49
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter, Claude?</font>

50
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ask yourself that, punk!</font>

51
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Claude.</font>

52
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's very rude to read 
another person's diary.</font>

53
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When are you gonna learn to check 
that attitude of yours, huh?</font>

54
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't help it.</font>

55
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Witch was very clear that if 
anything makes me upset or sad,</font>

56
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to write it down in my diary 
and not keep it bottled up,</font>

57
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so the filth doesn't rot my heart.</font>

58
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're calling me rotten filth?</font>

59
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna! What the hell have you 
been teaching this brat?!</font>

60
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please don't be angry with Miss Witch!</font>

61
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay! I feel better after 
writing my feelings down,</font>

62
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm not as disgusted by your 
presence as I was a minute ago.</font>

63
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just doubling down 
on the insults, are we?!</font>

64
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can't help it, Claude. Lize 
is a cursed youngling, after all.</font>

65
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He shouldn't be bottling toxic 
feelings up now, should he?</font>

66
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even little things can build 
up if you're not careful.</font>

67
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want Luna to have to grow another 
one of those huge, black mushrooms.</font>

68
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, I get it.</font>

69
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really, though?</font>

70
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're always grumpy and you 
take it out on everyone else.</font>

71
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We all have to set a good example so Lize 
doesn't turn into The End of All Things</font>

72
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">since he doesn't understand all this yet.</font>

73
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The cursed youngling, destined to one day 
turn into The End of All Things. Yeah.</font>

74
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure brought home a real 
bundle of trouble this time.</font>

75
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you even aware of what 
sort of mess you've dragged us all into?</font>

76
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't give a damn about 
what happens to the brat,</font>

77
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but this was all your call, 
so it's your responsibility.</font>

78
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Claude, you need to do something 
about that nasty attitude of yours.</font>

79
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not inspiring 
a lot of confidence, here.</font>

80
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know! For dinner tonight 
I'll do a big beef spit roast!</font>

81
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think crow pie would be a better choice.</font>

82
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>One day, these people saved me. 
I have no memories from before then.</i></font>

83
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't know who I am or where I'm going.</i></font>

84
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't even know the real reason 
why I have to keep a diary.</i></font>

85
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Tell us your name.</i></font>

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Lizel.</font>

87
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell was that?</font>

88
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you just feel a blast of wind 
from him the second he said his name?</font>

89
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you. Did you just 
use some kind of magic?</font>

90
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... haven't...</font>

91
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should not use that name anymore.</font>

92
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna?</font>

93
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what happened 
to him, but I have a feeling</font>

94
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he shouldn't be using that name.</font>

95
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His true name?</font>

96
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably.</font>

97
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that, unlike black witches,</font>

98
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">since the white witches 
have weak magical powers,</font>

99
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they depend on contracts 
and "spells" to use magic.</font>

100
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, since they are 
bound to those spells,</font>

101
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">their "true names" are the 
keys to unlocking that magic.</font>

102
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their true names are like weak spots.</font>

103
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Revealing them basically opens 
them up to be targeted by curses.</font>

104
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What? What are these people talking about?</i></font>

105
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fact that he would 
just blurt it out to us</font>

106
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">must mean he's seriously disoriented.</font>

107
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Do they mean me?</i></font>

108
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

109
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You are the one who should 
never have been born.</i></font>

110
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this place?</font>

111
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you people?</font>

112
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why am I here?</font>

113
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How...</font>

114
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who...</font>

115
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Who in the world am I?</i></font>

116
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I believe...</font>

117
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that I am in your debt. It seems 
like you must have rescued me.</font>

118
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much. I...</font>

119
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">should be going now. I wish I had 
something to give you as thanks.</font>

120
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? What did I tell you?</font>

121
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm hurt?</i></font>

122
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh? A mushroom... doll?</i></font>

123
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A transference doll, huh?</font>

124
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wound got better.</font>

125
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it moved?</font>

126
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is that?</font>

127
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must now care diligently 
for this fellow,</font>

128
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">until he recovers from the injury 
he accepted in your place.</font>

129
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

130
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That will be your first responsibility.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. What did you just do to me?</font>

268
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:11,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Uh, I... there was a black fog...</font>

269
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, did I... do something?</font>

270
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you just say "black fog" to me?</font>

271
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay the hell away from that black fog,</font>

272
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and never try to touch me...

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How did I already know 
about it? What am I?</i></font>

280
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kid is a disaster.</font>

281
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt he even realizes he's already 
sucking poisons out of people and things.</font>

282
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this rate, he's gonna run out of time 
a whole lot sooner than we expected.</font>

283
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it isn't his fault.</font>

284
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to force him to learn some 
kind of magic to deal with this</font>

285
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">before his body absorbs more 
poison than it can handle.</font>

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What are they talking about?</i></font>

287
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is it about me?</i></font>

288
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kid is a poisonous monster.</font>

289
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The moment we determine he's a lost cause,</font>

290
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there will be no choice but to kill him.</font>

291
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that what you want, Luna?</font>

292
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you keep going this easy on him, 
that's exactly what will happen.</font>

293
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if I can use mushrooms to suck out
 the poison collected in his body,</font>

294
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we shouldn't have to rush 
to a decision that quickly.</font>

295
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but we already talked 
about what a huge risk that—</font>
