1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stand up, Kizuki.</font>

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you still love Mizuho, you need 
to take a stand once more.</font>

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right.</i></font>

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Back then, I fell for the Kizuki 
that only looked forward.</i></font>

5
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2021</font></font>

6
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome in!</font>

7
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One peperoncino pasta, one carbonara, 
one grapefruit juice,</font>

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and one order of iced tea please—</font>

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh.</font>

10
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Per... Per favore?</font>

11
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Si, grazie.</font>

12
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of iced tea, Mizuho?</font>

13
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milk? Lemon? Straight?</font>

14
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shoot!</font>

15
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I forgot to ask!</font>

16
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go ask right now!</font>

17
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your apron's loose.</font>

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I going to do with you?</font>

19
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

20
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, youth.</font>

21
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mizuho-chan?</font>

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

23
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know you can work part-time here 
in the off-seasons too, right?</font>

24
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dad!</font>

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honey! Stop grinning like a fool 
and start cooking!</font>

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

27
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll cook your free meal 
in a bit, Mizuho-chan.</font>

28
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can head home 
after you eat that with Syugo.</font>

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay! I love your Margherita!</font>

30
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to work your worth for that.</font>

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can count on it!</font>

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't realize the Mitsushima Beach 
fireworks festival was today.</font>

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

34
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, you're 
working too many shifts.</font>

35
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't push yourself, okay?</font>

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki's giving it his all 
for his competitions.</font>

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to save up enough to cheer 
for him outside the prefecture!</font>

39
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe it's the last year.</font>

40
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope he makes it to the inter-highs.</font>

41
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

42
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I'll pay Kizuki a visit
 to see him sobbing</font>

43
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when he doesn't beat the standard scores.</font>

44
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure he'll make it this year!</font>

45
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! Amazing!</font>

46
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can see them so clearly!</font>

47
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you know about this place?</font>

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Toya.</font>

49
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. Why did you invite me out today?</font>

50
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I told you that 
I was rejected by Kizuki?</font>

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like you said, Toya.</font>

52
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki accepted everything about me.</font>

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a great guy after all.</font>

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really like myself right now.</font>

55
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Toya.</font>

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't deserve your gratitude.</font>

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know I said I wouldn't 
lay my hands on you.</font>

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I take it back.</font>

60
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget about that guy.</font>

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like you.</font>

62
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know if I could 
ever forget about Kizuki.</font>

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't matter.</font>

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki. Hold on.</font>

65
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

66
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This won't take long.</font>

67
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The others should be here soon, too.</font>

68
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki? You here?</font>

69
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We brought something good for ya.</font>

70
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

71
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A little something from all of us.</font>

72
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were talking about how we wanted 
to root for you for working so hard.</font>

73
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you! I'm so happy.</font>

74
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's inside?</font>

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something you'll like.</font>

76
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a surprise.</font>

77
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What could it be?</font>

78
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You doing all right? You've been 
cramming a lot of practice lately.</font>

79
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

80
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a lot, but I've been able to 
shorten my time thanks to that.</font>

81
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm even doing an interview 
for a swimming magazine soon.</font>

82
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously? Cool!</font>

83
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been working so hard, Kizuki.</font>

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I really want to 
make it to the inter-highs.</font>

85
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you will.</font>

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

87
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'm heading out now!</font>

88
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

89
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The next time we can all meet would have 
to be after the inter-highs are decided.</font>

90
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

91
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna grab a bite somewhere 
before we go home?</font>

92
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like a plan!</font>

93
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shin, you're coming too, right?</font>

94
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll tag along for a bit.</font>

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you, Airu?</font>

96
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. I'm gonna pass!</font>

97
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Do you have a photoshoot today?</font>

98
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope.</font>

99
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I need to stop by 
somewhere after this.</font>

100
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There! Done!</font>

101
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well?</font>

102
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It took some time, 
but I think I did a great job!</font>

103
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! Eat up!</font>

104
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it good?</font>

105
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon. What's your rating?</font>

106
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you like it?</font>

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

108
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

109
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna eat, too.</font>

110
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bon appétit!</font>

111
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then Kizuki told us he's 
gonna be featured in a magazine!</font>

112
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that cool?</font>

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All eyes are on him as an athlete.</font>

114
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here!</font>

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy Birthday, Toya.</font>

116
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

117
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you able to spend time 
with me this weekend, too?</font>

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I don't have anything 
planned on the weekend, so—</font>

119
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, I need to take this.</font>

120
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello?</font>

121
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A "thank you" for the gift?</font>

122
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to do that.</font>

123
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? This weekend?</font>

124
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're free for a whole day, Kizuki?</font>

125
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should totally hang!</font>

126
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anywhere you wanna go?</font>

127
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. We can plan more at school.</font>

128
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later.</font>

129
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you not even realize that 
since the moment you hung out with me,</font>

130
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">all you do is talk about him?</font>

131
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, I just subconsciously...</font>

132
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Subconsciously, huh?</font>

133
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm such an idiot.</font>

134
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way I could 
forget about Kizuki.</font>

135
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a pathetic face.</font>

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though I'm the one who hurt him.</font>

137
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2030</font></font>

138
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was so awkward back then.</i></font>

139
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,500

140
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's done. Come help.</font>

141
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

142
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then!</font>

143
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To celebrate the long awaited reunion 
of the Koigahama Highlands crew...</font>

144
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

145
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on! Why is it just you guys?!</font>

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shin's at work.</font>

147
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know about Kizuki.</font>

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you still fighting with Kizuki?</font>

149
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such a stubborn four-eyes!</font>

150
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going back to England 
starting next week, too.</font>

151
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Stay longer!</font>

152
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up and leave.</font>

153
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to say something 
to everyone before I flew off.</font>

154
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

155
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm getting married.</font>

156
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M... Married?</font>

157
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

158
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, since my boyfriend and I 
have Japanese nationalities,</font>

159
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we can't get "married" for real.</font>

160
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted you all to approve of him 
as my partner now that we live together.</font>

161
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's amazing! Congratulations, Airu!</font>

162
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks. I knew you'd approve, Mizuho.</font>

163
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's he like?</font>

164
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Introduce us next time.</font>

165
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

166
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's super on top of things.</font>

167
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He knows pretty much 
everything about the five of us</font>

168
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">since I talk about us a lot.</font>

169
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But one day I hope we can get married 
just like everyone else in Japan.</font>

170
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ended up drinking until morning.</font>

171
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a celebration.</font>

172
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But who would have thought one of 
us would be talking about marriage?</font>

173
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're really adults now.</font>

174
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yummy!</font>

175
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your pizzas really are the best!</font>

176
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grazie!</font>

177
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

178
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to hurry and learn how 
to make pizza as great as me.</font>

179
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why should I? You're here to do that.</font>

180
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're still a kid, Syugo.</font>

181
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you win over Mizuho-chan's stomach,</font>

182
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's a chance she'll 
be your bride. You know?</font>

183
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

184
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you like her, put in the effort.</font>

185
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing will progress 
if you don't make a move.</font>

186
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuho...</font>

187
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm? Did you say my name?</font>

188
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, never mind.</font>

189
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so weird, Syugo.</font>

192
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's so tall!</font>

193
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really sad that I couldn't

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to make up

start randomly looking for jobs,</font>

Being popular and all.</font>

217
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you guys know if Kizuki Hazawa-kun 
in the swim club has a girlfriend?</font>

218
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,100

you don't even teach here.</font>

229
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,020

230
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,100

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Togo, I...</font>

262
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not applying to colleges anymore.</font>

263
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to culinary school 
and take over the business.</font>

264
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo...</font>

265
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. Go to college.</font>

266
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about it.</font>

267
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take over the restaurant.</font>

268
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

269
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've already put in my resignation
 letter to the school.</font>

270
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What's with that?!</font>

271
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were finally able to be a teacher, 
like you've always wanted!</font>

272
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you giving up?!</font>

273
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take over the restaurant!</font>

274
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like I have ambitions 
like Kizuki and the others...</font>

275
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right, Syugo.</font>

276
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the only one that can do it.</font>

277
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, I'm the one who can take 
care of Dad's restaurant and Mom.</font>

278
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll understand 
when you're a little older.</font>

279
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can manage by hiring 
a chef for a while.</font>

280
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just focus on yourself.</font>

281
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go to college.</font>

282
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry.</font>

283
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll find what you want to do someday.</font>

284
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sup, Mizuho.</font>

285
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Finished with school?</font>

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. What about you, Syugo?</font>

287
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finished cleaning up the shop.</font>

288
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to finish it much sooner, though.</font>

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess we're still kids after all.</font>

290
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

291
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told Togo that I'll stop taking 
exams so I can take over the restaurant.</font>

292
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then he said that I needed to go 
to school and chased me away.</font>

293
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's always messing around, but when 
it comes to this, he gets so mature.</font>

294
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have a tendency of focusing 
on the things around you, Syugo.</font>

295
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why you look into others' hearts</font>

296
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">instead of thinking about
 what you want to do.</font>

297
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think Togo understands that 
you deeply care about your family</font>

298
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it made him happy.</font>

299
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just my take, considering you
 always see right through me.</font>

300
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why so serious?</font>

301
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The weather's nice.</font>

302
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mizuho.</font>

303
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is heaven...</font>

304
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">really somewhere out there?</font>

305
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mom!</font>

306
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take good care of Syugo's dad!</font>

307
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo's dad!</font>

308
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please make pizzas for my mom!</font>

309
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Margherita pizza with extra tomatoes!</font>

310
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think your dad heard me?</font>

311
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you stupid?</font>

312
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know!</font>

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made this for you.</font>

314
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

315
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A good luck charm.</font>

316
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that many good things 
come to you from now on.</font>

317
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're my precious 
three-star chef, after all.</font>

318
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are a...</font>

319
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep this a secret from Kizuki.</font>

320
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just for a minute.</font>

321
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

322
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Syugo.</font>

323
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know how in stories they say</font>

324
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Even when they die, 
they live on in people's hearts"?</font>

325
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whenever I'm drawing,</font>

326
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can hear my mom's voice in my head
 saying, "Wow, you drew so well, Mizuho!"</font>

327
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I wanted to hear 
that voice over and over again...</font>

328
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even after the mourning period, I didn't 
go to school and kept drawing at home.</font>

329
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you hear him too, Syugo? 
Your dad's voice?</font>

330
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo!</font>

331
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have some breakfast!</font>

332
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, sunny-side up eggs!</font>

333
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it, my precious son!</font>

334
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your flavors are so 
straightforward and pleasant.</font>

335
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can hear him.</font>

336
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2030</font></font>

337
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, we already made our last orders—</font>

338
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you here? Leave.</font>

339
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo...</font>

340
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm busy right now.</font>

341
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About before... I'm sorr—</font>

342
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was at fault.</font>

343
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your favorite dry tomato panini.</font>

344
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No broccoli.</font>

345
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for hitting you.</font>

346
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was delicious. Thank you.</font>

347
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help with the dishes.</font>

348
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Kay.</font>

349
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I came here 
and talked with you, Syugo.</font>

350
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good luck with your return match, Kizuki.</font>

351
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you hit a setback, 
don't disappear on us again.</font>

352
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

353
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it doesn't work out, then I'll come
back like I used to in the past.</font>

354
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be like your little brother 
and come crying back to you.</font>

355
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're really dazzling. It makes me sick.</font>

356
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

357
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Whoa!</font>

358
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There, there. Don't cry.</font>

359
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not crying yet.</font>

360
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I...</font>

361
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I decided a long time ago 
that I'd watch over you and Mizuho.</font>

362
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

363
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I tell Mizuho about my feelings?</font>

364
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki. Even though I'm the third-lead, 
I want you to take me on.</font>

365
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never once thought of you 
as the third-lead, Syugo.</font>

366
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's on.</font>
