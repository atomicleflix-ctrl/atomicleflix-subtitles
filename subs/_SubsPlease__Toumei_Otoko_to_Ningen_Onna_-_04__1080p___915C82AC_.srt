00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san.</font>

2
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought the client who needs 
an investigation.</font>

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Aya Sukiya.</font>

4
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An invisible person?</font>

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are too?</font>

6
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like Tonome in drag.</font>

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to say every thought 
that enters your head.</font>

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Tonome-san in drag"?</i></font>

9
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. She's a bit tactless.</font>

10
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Tonome-san, then?</font>

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

12
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never met an invisible 
person in the city before!</font>

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so relieved to have 
a member of my species helping me!</font>

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy to do so.</font>

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please let us help you.</font>

16
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What a coincidence!{bg}</font>

17
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka.</font>

18
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I was surprised too.{bg}</font>

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feeling self-conscious?</font>

20
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I thought the Tonome Detective Agency 
would be able to handle this case.{bg}</font>

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How could you say that? She's a client!</font>

22
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still...</font>

23
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It really must be a good sign!{bg}</font>

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like they're getting 
along real well, huh?</font>

25
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That happens when you don't run 
into your own kind very often.</font>

26
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's also my first time doing a job 
for a member of my species.{bg}</font>

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... Akira-san's voice does sound 
a bit friendlier than usual.</font>

28
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Tonome-san, were you born 
in the invisible person village?{bg}</font>

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No, I was raised outside of it.{bg}</font>

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you are self-conscious.</font>

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's cute!</font>

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So was I!{bg}</font>

33
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}MEETING ROOM</font>

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been accused of theft?</font>

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

36
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The money went missing 
from a safe at work.</font>

37
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one was visible 
on the security cameras.</font>

38
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The vice president decided that 
an invisible person must have done it.</font>

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did the president say?</font>

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The president is in the hospital.</font>

41
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The vice president's 
been standing in.</font>

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't do it, of course!</font>

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the vice president seems 
convinced it was me...</font>

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though he has no proof?</font>

45
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's difficult to get an alibi,</font>

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">since invisible people can't 
be identified by their faces.</font>

48
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sukiya-san was elsewhere that day,</font>

49
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but she doesn't know how to prove 
it was her to establish an alibi.</font>

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry.</font>

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise I'll help you.</font>

52
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}MEETING ROOM</font>

53
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please do. Thank you.</font>

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Gamaike. I'm standing 
in for the president.</font>

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she's hired a lawyer 
and a private investigator, has she?</font>

56
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're an invisible person, too.</font>

57
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think I could see the video 
data from the security cameras?</font>

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... Of course you may.</font>

59
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

60
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems nobody interacted 
with the safe between</font>

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when you last closed it and 
when you opened it yesterday.</font>

62
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, and that's why!</font>

63
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You invisible people have 
that "full invisibility" thing</font>

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where you make your 
clothes vanish too, right?</font>

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm thinking she must have used that!</font>

66
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">E-Eh?</font>

67
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where did the detective go?!</font>

68
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

69
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how full invisibility works.</font>

70
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it only makes us 
invisible, not intangible.</font>

71
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Therefore...</font>

72
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way she could steal money 
from a safe that wasn't open.</font>

73
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well then...</font>

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose I got the wrong idea!</font>

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. The money went missing, 
so I was just so shaken...</font>

76
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We actually have another 
video to show you.</font>

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Starting a few days after you took 
over for the president,</font>

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you were seen secretly depositing bills 
into an ATM every day.</font>

79
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fearing that you would be found out,</font>

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you decided to exploit 
Sukiya-san's attributes</font>

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to lay the suspicion on her.</font>

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right?</font>

83
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe that would 
qualify as defamation.</font>

84
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Embezzlement, too.</font>

85
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on here?!</font>

86
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-Mr. President!</font>

87
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What were you doing while 
I was hospitalized for appendicitis?!</font>

88
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It was a spur-of-the-moment thing...</font>

89
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was clearly premeditated!</font>

90
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you! You saved me!</font>

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The president explained 
everything to the others,</font>

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'll be able to keep my job.</font>

93
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad your name was cleared.</font>

94
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really can't thank you enough.</font>

95
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, thank you for running 
such a swift investigation.</font>

96
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were able to solve the case before
claims against our client went too far.</font>

97
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And while you have so many 
other duties to see to...</font>

98
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're fine. Shizuka made sure 
all our schedules lined up.</font>

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We split it all up between
 the three of us.</font>

100
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was Yako's idea in the first place.</font>

101
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san's idea?</font>

102
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She wanted to do something to help you.</font>

103
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I really didn't do anything serious!</font>

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was mostly supporting the other two!</font>

105
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm sorry! 
I shouldn't have gone so far!</font>

106
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, but... why?</font>

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because...</font>

108
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though he has no proof?</font>

109
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I could sense a little 
anger in Akira-san's voice...</i></font>

110
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I'm sure I can't tell him that.</i></font>

111
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Shizuka-san.</font>

112
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You allowed us to save our client.</font>

113
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know.</font>

114
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about a little 
company trip as thanks?</font>

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, sounds great! 
I wanna go to the mountains!</font>

116
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great idea! How about camping?</font>

117
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're coming too? 
You don't even work here!</font>

118
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A mountain with a campground, then?</font>

119
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was fast.</font>

120
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I can't wait for the tents and campfires!{bg}</font>

121
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Daichi, we can drive them!{bg}</font>

122
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It should be fun, right, Shizuka-san?</font>

123
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}That's fine, but what about your job?{bg}</font>

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Akira-san's back to normal.</i></font>

125
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I'll take some paid days off, of course!{bg}</font>

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, it should be fun!</font>

127
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You're really into this, huh?{bg}</font>

128
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's mountain time!</font>

129
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">River time!</font>

130
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Camping time!</font>

131
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yeah!</font>

132
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you two help?</font>

133
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that asshole lawyer up to?</font>

134
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setting up the smoker!</font>

135
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you wearing 
sunglasses, Shizuka-san?</font>

136
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look very cool, though.</font>

137
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With all the trees around, there's a 
good chance of taking a branch to the eye.</font>

138
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is how I prevent that.</font>

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see!</font>

140
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, how can I help?</font>

141
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you mind grinding the beans 
for when we take a break?</font>

142
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

143
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I don't know how to put up a tent.</font>

144
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about chopping wood, then?</font>

145
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't even need an ax!</font>

146
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to like camping, Madaraito-san.</font>

147
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got together most 
of the camping equipment, too.</font>

148
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I actually used to hate the mountains.</font>

149
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, thanks to Daichi, 
I've come to love them.</font>

150
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san.</font>

151
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to take a walk with me?</font>

152
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't all the sounds soothing?</font>

153
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The smells on the wind, too...</font>

154
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you prefer to slow down a bit?</font>

155
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, this pace is perfect.</font>

156
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no fence for a while.</font>

157
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you prefer to walk 
on the far side of the road?</font>

158
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's on the other side of the fence?</font>

159
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A sharp incline, like a cliff.</font>

160
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We wouldn't want to fall off that!</font>

161
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I feel safe knowing 
you're here, Akira-san.</font>

162
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel safe knowing you're 
here too, Shizuka-san.</font>

163
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right...</i></font>

164
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Akira-san had that scary experience 
in the mountains that one time.</i></font>

165
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really okay 
with a trip to the mountains?</font>

166
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did have some 
lingering trauma about it,</font>

167
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I feel like I can handle 
anything if you're here,</font>

168
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I completely forgot about the trauma!</font>

169
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sure I'm not...</font>

170
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, there's a bench.</font>

171
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's have a sit.</font>

172
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... I'm sure I'm not worth 
that much to you.</font>

173
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you already helped with 
that invisible person case, didn't you?</font>

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was nothing, really!</font>

175
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just...</font>

176
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just what?</font>

177
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't usually get angry like that...</font>

178
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Did I frighten you?</font>

179
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I mean!</font>

180
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just thinking, if you were 
the one accused like that...</font>

181
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I start imagining it... 
and it feels so sad and suffocating...</font>

182
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But then I think that maybe I should 
have just minded my own business...</font>

183
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to worry about it so much.</font>

184
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Akira-san's sensations... His body heat, 
his smell... It's suddenly so intense!</i></font>

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Historically, invisible people 
have been treated with suspicion.</font>

186
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm really glad that, 
thanks to you and the others,</font>

187
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we were able to clear 
the client's name completely.</font>

188
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But more important than that...</font>

189
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Akira-san?!</font>

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's pressed against 
my back... He's so warm!</i></font>

191
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't like this?</font>

192
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah... S'okay...</font>

193
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you just laugh? I felt 
the slight shaking in your body!</font>

194
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't hide my feelings 
from you, Shizuka-san.</font>

195
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what makes me the happiest.</font>

196
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you to uncover 
more things about me.</font>

197
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Was that just...</font>

198
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I kissed you.</font>

199
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I not have?</font>

200
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it was okay, really!</font>

201
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it time to get back?</font>

202
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey...</font>

203
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could we stay like this a bit longer?</font>

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall I do it again?</font>

205
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... I would find that... 
unobjectionable.</font>

206
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, they've been gone a while.</font>

207
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here, all peeled.</font>

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You gotta have curry when you're camping!</font>

209
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Takes you back, huh?</font>

210
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I used to hate the mountains.</font>

211
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hated them so much, 
I started to hold a grudge.</font>

212
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd think, "I'm gonna find the guy who 
came up with school trips to the mountains</font>

213
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and sue him for all he's worth."</font>

214
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Madaraito, you okay?</font>

215
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys go on without me.</font>

216
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

217
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure?</font>

218
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, go on. 
I'll catch up in my own time.</font>

219
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... catch you later, then.</font>

220
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Man, everyone's leaving me behind.</i></font>

221
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I hate school trips!</i></font>

222
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hey, is that...</i></font>

223
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kikira-kun?</i></font>

224
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're in the same class, 
but we've never talked before.</i></font>

225
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Still, what a relief.</i></font>

226
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It feels nice to know 
that someone else is back here.</i></font>

227
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Having Kikira-kun here 
has helped me keep going...</i></font>

228
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But...</i></font>

229
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't take anymore.</i></font>

230
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kikira-kun?!</font>

231
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks?</font>

232
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

233
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey, wait! I can't make you do that!</font>

234
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then walk faster already. Sheesh.</font>

235
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That sudden spike of tsun!</i></font>

237
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It took you two a while.</font>

238
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone else has already had lunch.</font>

240
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for before.</font>

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to eat lunch with me?</font>

242
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

243
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?!</font>

244
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like we're friends.</font>

245
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... you helped me <i>even 
though</i> we aren't friends!</font>

246
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like how you give up a seat 
to a random old person on the train.</font>

247
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm like a random old person?!</font>

248
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

249
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! It feels awkward 
for me to eat by myself!</font>

250
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat with me!</font>

251
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, if you want.</font>

252
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad!</font>

253
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I get it. Kikira-kun's an awkward guy.</i></font>

254
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why I don't hear about him getting

255
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can have some of mine!</font>

256
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fried chicken, then.</font>

257
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No shame at all!</font>

258
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, let's sit together on the bus.</font>

259
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want.</font>

262
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,420

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you weren't sleeping?!</font>

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So I can stay like this?!</i></font>

269
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

270
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

271
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that was that!</font>

272
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just kind of started dating!</font>

273
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, he's always been 
exhausting like that, huh?</font>

274
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you held hands the whole way! 
That's so beautiful!</font>

275
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There we go.</font>

276
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The river's slow here, 
so it should be a good spot.</font>

277
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear the fishing's good here, too!</font>

278
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your build makes 
anything look flashy, huh?</font>

279
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And your stomach makes 
anything look imposing, huh?</font>

280
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll lay out the tarp over here.</font>

281
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Where are those other two?</font>

282
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said they'd catch up.</font>

283
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">J-Jarashi-san!</font>

284
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka-san? Is something the matter?</font>

285
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san?!</font>

286
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jarashi-san's already gone.</font>

287
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I call her?</font>

288
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No...</font>

289
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess maybe you could do it...</font>

290
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you come inside for a minute?</font>

291
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

292
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never worn this swimsuit before. 
I think I messed it up.</font>

293
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Akira-san?</font>

294
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, well... I mean...</font>

295
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like the other strap 
is tangled in the frill.</font>

296
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I thought that might be it.</font>

297
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you choose this swimsuit?</font>

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Jarashi-san picked it for me.</font>

299
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

300
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really charming. I love it.</font>

301
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?! I'm so glad!</font>

302
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}The cute!</i></font>

303
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This came with it as well.</font>

305
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I put it on?</font>

306
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do that.</font>

307
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're here!</font>

308
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka, you're adorable!</font>

309
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at all of them!</font>

310
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't this feel nice?</font>

311
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

312
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, the fish are heading your way.</font>

313
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got it.</font>

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take that!</font>

315
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jarashi-san, you're amazing.</font>

316
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That scared me!</font>

317
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come try it, Tonome!</font>

318
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me?</font>

319
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid I'm hopeless.</font>

320
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I bet.</font>

321
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Tonome, are you kinda jacked?</font>

322
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When your shirt gets wet,
 it sticks to you,</font>

323
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I can see your body's contours.</font>

324
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I see.</font>

325
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Akira-san is... well-muscled?</i></font>

326
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Akira-san! Shouldn't 
you take your shirt off?</font>

327
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no fun to stand 
around in wet clothes!</font>

328
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's true.</font>

329
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't really do that.</font>

330
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?</font>

331
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's... how to put it...</font>

332
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I take off my shirt, you'll be able to 
see inside my bottoms from above...</font>

333
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's just... a little embarrassing.</font>

334
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really get it.</font>

335
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure I get it either.</font>

336
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't see it anyway.</font>

337
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just very embarrassing 
for invisible people!</font>

338
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Jarashi.</font>

339
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Catch some more fish. 
We'll cook 'em for lunch.</font>

340
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, great idea!</font>

341
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san.</font>

342
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could I say something?</font>

343
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

344
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't like when other people... 
uncover things about you.</font>

345
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something like that.</font>

346
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm very sorry about that.</font>

347
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to interrupt the fun, 
but could you do that somewhere else?</font>

348
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can sleep if you want.</font>

349
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, I'm okay.</font>

350
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just let me know when you want 
me to tag in at the wheel.</font>

351
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I'm gonna trust a guy who's yawning.</font>

352
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's mean.</font>

353
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's that inscrutable 
kindness of yours.</font>

354
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good thing I love it.</font>

355
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What in the world...</font>

356
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The others are fast asleep.</font>

357
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coming home from a trip 
always tires you out, huh?</font>

358
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm actually still awake...</i></font>

359
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd love to go on a trip just with her...</i></font>

360
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,250
