00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,220

to Flamme are never real.</font>

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,150

I've seen so far, though.</font>

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,300

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really don't understand the appeal.</font>

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, when all you see are fakes,</font>

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you start to doubt whether the 
genuine article ever existed at all.</font>

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flamme, the founder of humanity's magic, 
is like a fairy tale herself.</font>

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A fairy tale, huh?</font>

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose. It's been long enough since then.</font>

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so impressive?</font>

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course it is.</font>

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

52
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With the road blocked, 
I didn't know what I was going to do.</font>

53
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, is this really necessary?</font>

54
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not happy about it? 
The reward isn't bad.</font>

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I mean, couldn't you just use magic

56

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,350

62
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,960

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,550

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,230

75
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And can't you be friendlier, too? 
I'm sensitive, okay?</font>

76
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a pain in the rear.</font>

77
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you call me?!</font>

78
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you making progress over there?</font>

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

81
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,000

84
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've lived many years, but this 
is my first time seeing one.</font>

85
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose we're something of a rarity.</font>

86
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, I've never 
seen an elf besides you.</font>

87
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There aren't very many of us.</font>

88
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only seen my own kind a handful of times.</font>

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Elves may live a long time,</font>

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but across the board, we lack romantic 
feelings and reproductive instincts.</font>

91
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,250

92
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The last time I met a fellow elf 
was more than 400 years ago.</font>

93
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps we're closer 
to the end than I thought.</font>

94
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can see the town now.</font>

95
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a line of wagons.</font>

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those look like merchants.</font>

100
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,610

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what the Liberation 
Festival commemorates.</font>

102
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The statues of Mr. Himmel and his companions 
in the central plaza are decorated,</font>

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the entire town 
throws a grand celebration.</font>

104
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans love to make a fuss.</font>

105
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They hold festivals for everything.</font>

106
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been more than eighty years 
since the demons were defeated.</font>

107
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's more than enough time for something 
to pass from human memory.</font>

108
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But on this day, everyone 
remembers the party of heroes.</font>

109
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice work.</font>

110
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Five retakes, huh?</font>

111
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finished sooner than usual this time.</font>

112
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're always getting statues made, Himmel.</font>

113
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I want everyone to remember us.</font>

114
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unlike you, we don't live that long.</font>

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need future generations to 
remember how handsome I was.</font>

116
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm heading back to the inn.</font>

117
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I guess the biggest reason</font>

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is so you won't be alone in the future.</font>

119
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does that mean?</font>

120
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not fairy tales.</font>

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We really existed.</font>

122
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every year, we celebrate the great deeds 
accomplished by the party of heroes.</font>

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, you look a lot</font>

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">like the statue of Ms. Frieren 
from that very party.</font>

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will they still be doing this 
a hundred years from now?</font>

126
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, as long as this town still stands.</font>

127
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about a thousand?</font>

128
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I don't know.</font>

129
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we go?</font>

130
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're heading far to the north.</font>

131
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, you haven't 
told me your destination yet.</font>

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are we going?</font>

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heaven.</font>

134
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that sounds fun.</font>

135
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,070
<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><b>{\an9}28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in Graf Granat's domain, located in the northern lands</b></font>

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are a lot of guards here.</font>

137
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you suppose something happened?</font>

138
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's decide who's going shopping.</font>

139
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, we're in a town.</font>

140
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sense demons.</font>

141
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

142
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you! What are you doing?!</font>

143
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Granat, did you put her up to this?</font>

144
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner, while it's true 
I despise you and wish you dead,</font>

145
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not foolish enough to openly attack 
peace envoys in the middle of town.</font>

146
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Peace envoys?</font>

147
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're probably adventurers 
who don't know what's going on.</font>

148
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you say so.</font>

149
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's bloodlust in those calm, cold eyes.</font>

150
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the townsfolk who hate us 
look upon me as a person,</font>

151
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even as they tremble in fear.</font>

152
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you look at me as 
though I'm a wild beast.</font>

153
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you?</font>

154
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You demons are wild beasts who 
imitate human speech</font>

155
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but can't be communicated with.</font>

156
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Throw her in the dungeon 
beneath the mansion.</font>

157
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, milord.</font>

158
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

160
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm bored.</font>

161
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren.</font>

162
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said to reflect on your 
actions for two or three years.</font>

163
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's shorter than I expected.</font>

164
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you bring me some grimoires later?</font>

165
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really do love to waste time.</font>

166
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not here because I want to be.</font>

167
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what did he mean when he referred 
to those demons as peace envoys?</font>

168
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I looked into it while shopping.</font>

169
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know of Aura the Guillotine, don't you?</font>

170
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's one of the Seven Sages of Destruction 
who served the Demon King.</font>

171
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She lost most of her followers 
fighting against us.</font>

172
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Last I heard, her whereabouts were unknown.</font>

173
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen recently?</font>

174
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aura regained her power 28 years ago.</font>

175
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her forces have been embroiled in battle 
with this town for a long time,</font>

176
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they've become exhausted 
by the fruitless fighting,</font>

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they're suing for peace.</font>

178
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's why they were allowed in as envoys.</font>

179
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a bad move.</font>

180
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trying to talk to demons is pointless.</font>

181
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be pointless.</font>

182
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're capable of speech.</font>

183
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely the best option would be 
to resolve things by talking them out?</font>

184
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They can't resolve things that way. 
That's why it's pointless.</font>

185
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demons are man-eating monsters.</font>

186
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you ever wondered why they 
speak the same language as humans?</font>

187
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hero, you must slay the fiend!</font>

188
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only a child.</font>

189
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what? That thing ate our daughter!</font>

190
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It hurts...</font>

191
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It hurts, Mom...</font>

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough. I'll do it.</font>

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'd be no different from the demons.</font>

194
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not as though they have to 
eat humans to survive, right?</font>

195
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we give her 
the opportunity to atone?</font>

196
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chief...</font>

197
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't be serious!</font>

198
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give us back our daughter!</font>

199
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll tend your wounds at my home.</font>

200
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been looking for someone 
to help on the farm.</font>

201
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel, you'll regret not 
killing it now. It's a—</font>

202
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, we're capable of speech 
with each other.</font>

203
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be staying in this village anyway.</font>

204
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we see how it goes?</font>

205
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

206
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you kill the village chief?</font>

207
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should've killed it back then.</font>

208
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There it is again.</font>

209
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every day I felt your desire to kill me.</font>

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want to live in peace.</font>

211
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I brought you a replacement 
for the daughter I ate.</font>

212
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the village chief's daughter.</font>

213
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the village chief is gone now.</font>

214
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems I've made a mistake somehow.</font>

215
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I have no choice. 
I'm taking this child hostage.</font>

216
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't stop me again, will you?</font>

217
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mom...</font>

219
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Mom" again?</font>

220
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like monsters, demons don't raise their young.</font>

221
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They spend most of their time 
after birth living in solitude.</font>

222
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're solitary creatures by nature. 
You have no concept of family.</font>

223
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why do you use the word "mom"?</font>

224
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because it stops you from killing us.</font>

225
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A wonderful, magical word...</font>

226
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For them, words are a means 
of deceiving humans.</font>

227
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flamme the Legendary Mage defined 
monsters capable of speech as demons.</font>

228
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're descended from 
monsters who cried "help"</font>

229
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from the shadows to lure humans to them.</font>

230
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't forget to bring me grimoires.</font>

231
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Granat is late.</font>

232
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A human diplomatic tactic.</font>

233
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In any case, I'm curious about that mage.</font>

234
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know her face from somewhere.</font>

235
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wild beasts who can't be 
communicated with, huh?</font>

236
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's an accurate description.</font>

237
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's the only one in this town who 
understands the true nature of us demons.</font>

238
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's only one reason that predators</font>

239
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who prey on humans would 
speak the human language.</font>

240
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They speak not to understand us 
but to deceive us.</font>

241
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This town won't be around much longer.</font>

242
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should take advantage of 
the confusion to escape.</font>

243
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

244
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My son's room.</font>

245
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a good boy.</font>

246
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd often boast about how he'd take over 
the family soon so I could take it easy.</font>

247
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Majesty gave him this sword 
when he fought in his presence.</font>

248
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is your son now?</font>

249
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He died in battle against 
Aura ten years ago.</font>

250
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All that came home to me was his sword.</font>

251
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lügner!</font>

252
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only invited you here to avenge my son.</font>

253
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to kill all of you 
envoys here and now.</font>

254
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your peace means nothing to me!</font>

255
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This room is quite clean.</font>

256
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you've been keeping it 
just as it was ten years ago.</font>

257
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what if I have?</font>

258
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've kept my father's room the same 
since you killed him, too.</font>

259
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we put an end 
to this, Graf Granat?</font>

260
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or shall we continue to shed each other's 
blood and cause even more grief?</font>

261
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're capable of speech with each other.</font>

262
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please grant us the opportunity 
to settle this with discussion.</font>

263
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show them to the guestroom.</font>

264
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll consider it.</font>

265
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner,</font>

266
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what is a "father"?</font>

267
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows?</font>

268
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Granat resents us, but he 
seems to be an empathetic man.</font>

269
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we win him over, we may 
be able to convince him</font>

270
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to lower this town's defensive 
barrier in the name of peace.</font>

271
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then Lady Aura's forces will raze this town.</font>

272
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Linie, I don't see Draht.</font>

273
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said he was off to eliminate an obstacle.</font>

274
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's acting rashly.</font>

275
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I to do with that 
hot-blooded youngster?</font>

276
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Draht, you should not be here.</font>

277
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please return to the guest—</font>

278
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you? Visiting hours are over.</font>

279
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Draht, one of Aura the 
Guillotine's executioners.</font>

280
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am here to kill you.</font>

281
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Done pretending to negotiate?</font>

282
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're just getting started.</font>

283
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-huh.</font>

284
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>According to Lord Lügner, 
this girl is the only obstacle in our way.</i></font>

285
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:39,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I kill her, and we win over Graf Granat, 
this town will fall easily.</i></font>

286
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just so you know, I'm strong.</font>

287
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stronger than me?</font>

288
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.</font>

289
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>And you alright</i></font>

290
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Can you hear me</i></font>

291
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:02,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i></font>

292
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,360
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Crying excessively</i></font>

293
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Wanting you to smile</i></font>

294
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,580
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i></font>

295
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i></font>

296
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i></font>

297
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Unremarkable yet special</i></font>

298
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>See, things that couldn't have been</i></font>

299
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,300
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i></font>

300
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Why? They begin to overflow</i></font>

301
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,150
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>So, if I were to be born again</i></font>

302
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:48,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I would surely choose this place once more</i></font>

303
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>So, if we were to meet again</i></font>

304
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i></font>

305
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Even if no promises were made</i></font>

306
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i></font>

307
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,800
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i></font>

308
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i></font>

309
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>for you to come back home</i></font>

310
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Who is that mage?</font>

311
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking so casually to me 
is a serious crime in this town...</font>

312
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We don't stand a chance against them.</font>

313
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You're a guard-killer who should be executed.</font>

314
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I hate fighting powerful opponents, too.</font>

315
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}This fight is already over.</font>

316
