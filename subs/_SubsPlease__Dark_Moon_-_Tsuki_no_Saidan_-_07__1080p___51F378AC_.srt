6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,350

00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,930

57
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for lying to you.</font>

58
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,130

59

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just couldn't tell you.</font>

60
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You hating us scared us way more than 
anyone else finding out we're vampires.</font>

61
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Sooha.</font>

62
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I'm confused.</font>

63
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you're vampires.</font>

64
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You grew up at the orphanage 
together, right?</font>

65
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you all become vampires?</font>

66
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you all bitten as children?</font>

67
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know.</font>

68
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been vampires for as 
long as we can remember.</font>

69
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was an orphanage in name only.</font>

70
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were actually imprisoned 
and kept under close watch.</font>

71
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a long time, that was our whole world.</font>

72
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know anything for certain.</font>

73
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know if we were 
bitten or born this way.</font>

74
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only that, but unlike other vampires, 
we're fine with sunlight and crosses.</font>

75
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then how do you know you're vampires?</font>

76
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you have special powers, 
but you could be different, like me.</font>

77
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We get the urge to drink blood.</font>

78
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We instinctively seek it out.</font>

79
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't want to eat anything else, 
and we don't die if we don't.</font>

80
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we only drink blood once a year.</font>

81
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On our birthday.</font>

82
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We only drink the blood of 
recently deceased animals.</font>

83
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've never hurt a person, 
and we've never drunk human blood.</font>

84
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We swore to each other we wouldn't.</font>

85
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true. Please believe me.</font>

86
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you don't have to believe me.</font>

87
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do my best to convince you.</font>

88
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you come to save me?</font>

89
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said those terrible things to you.</font>

90
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I felt like I had to.</font>

91
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I had to protect you.</font>

92
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since the moment I first met you...</font>

93
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've felt like that was my destiny.</font>

94
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until then, I didn't know who 
I was or how I should live.</font>

95
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But for the first time, 
I felt like I'd found the answer.</font>

96
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was born to protect you, 
and I have to keep protecting you.</font>

97
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heli...</font>

98
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to bite my neck?</font>

99
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? We shouldn't do that!</font>

100
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I trust you.</font>

101
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Sooha?</font>

102
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. You barely put your mouth on me.</font>

103
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you?</font>

104
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem strained.</font>

105
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you want to drink my blood?</font>

106
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be lying if I said 
I didn't feel the impulse.</font>

107
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But not losing your 
trust is more important.</font>

108
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to disappoint you.</font>

109
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You trusted me after learning what I am.</font>

110
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to betray you.</font>

111
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not disappointed.</font>

112
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've never betrayed me.</font>

113
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until now, I've hated 
vampires more than anything.</font>

114
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought they were dangerous 
monsters who attacked people.</font>

115
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you always came to my 
rescue when I was in danger.</font>

116
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That made me really happy.</font>

117
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowing you're a vampire 
won't make me hate you.</font>

118
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for saying those 
awful things earlier.</font>

119
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't changed 
since the moment we met.</font>

120
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad we got to know each other more.</font>

121
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you'll always be my friend.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because you came to save me.</font>

137
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

138
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, don't worry.</font>

139
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're tough.</font>

140
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good.</font>

141
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for the help earlier.</font>

142
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

143
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to thank us.</font>

144
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We couldn't ignore the situation, either.</font>

145
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

146
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha, you probably saw earlier...</font>

147
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we're actually werewolves.</font>

148
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

149
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

150
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You saw us back there, right?</font>

151
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for scaring you.</font>

152
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone fears and avoids those 
who are different from them.</font>

153
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We thought you'd hate us if you found out.</font>

154
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we couldn't afford to 
think about that back there.</font>

155
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We wanted to save you no matter what.</font>

156
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khan, you guys...</font>

157
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for saving me.</font>

158
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I saw Sooha get knocked down, 
I felt a rage I'd never felt before.</font>

159
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before I knew it, I'd turned into a wolf
 and was charging toward him.</font>

160
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been meaning to tell you guys, 
but I don't even know what I am.</font>

161
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Solon.</font>

162
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was surprising, but it 
doesn't change anything.</font>

163
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Exactly.</font>

164
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

165
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well said, Jino.</font>

166
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute.</font>

167
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Haven't we badmouthed werewolves a ton?</font>

168
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did, too.</font>

169
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you really strong 
when you turn into a wolf?</font>

170
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh...</font>

171
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else changes?</font>

172
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your body temperature rises, right?</font>

173
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's faster, you or Jakah?</font>

174
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've actually always wanted 
to ride on a wolf's back!</font>

175
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too!</font>

176
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too.</font>

177
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And me!</font>

178
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

179
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who wouldn't?</font>

180
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I'm definitely faster!</font>

181
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you, children?</font>

182
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Should we see who's faster?</font>

183
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha! Heli!</font>

184
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jakah.</font>

185
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jaan.</font>

186
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion.</font>

187
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noa.</font>

188
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jino.</font>

189
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Solon.</font>

190
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you all so much.</font>

191
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Solon.</font>

192
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry you had to reveal 
your secret because of me.</font>

193
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It had nothing to do with you.</font>

194
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That guy just pissed me off.</font>

195
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, but I wanted 
to say it nonetheless.</font>

196
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. And thank you.</font>

197
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something I want to tell you guys.</font>

198
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't hate you even if you're vampires.</font>

199
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you're different 
from me even if you're werewolves.</font>

200
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:19,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've hidden my unusual power until now,
 but you accepted me the way I am.</font>

201
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That made me really happy.</font>

202
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So now, will you let me
 do the same for you?</font>

203
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

204
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

205
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd love to be friends.</font>

206
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heck, let's become even better friends!</font>

207
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

208
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enzy told me about you.</font>

209
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should've told us sooner.</font>

210
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, Solon can be so weirdly stubborn!</font>

211
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up.</font>

212
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just can't figure it out.</font>

213
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did he look like my 
childhood friend Chris?</font>

214
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean he's actually someone else?</font>

215
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then who was that vampire?</font>

216
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know yet,</font>

217
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he's on another level from 
the vampires we've faced until now.</font>

218
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, he said something 
odd before he disappeared.</font>

219
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something odd?</font>

220
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

221
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really don't know anything, do you?</font>

222
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does that mean?</font>

223
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He also said, "Do you want 
to meet the same fate again?"</font>

224
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It almost sounded like 
he'd fought us before.</font>

225
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe he knows you guys.</font>

226
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To tell you the truth, 
our friends keep going missing.</font>

227
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

228
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Werewolves have always 
been targeted by vampires.</font>

229
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's gotten worse lately.</font>

230
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our brothers are looking into it,</font>

231
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they haven't found any 
useful information yet.</font>

232
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And yesterday, we lost contact with them.</font>

233
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girl from our school 
who was attacked...</font>

234
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was a werewolf, too.</font>

235
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The culprit hasn't been caught yet?</font>

236
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We assumed the victim was attacked by 
a vampire because she was a werewolf.</font>

237
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But maybe we were wrong.</font>

238
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She looked just like Sooha.</font>

239
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So their actual target was Sooha?</font>

240
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guy who attacked 
today is the murderer?</font>

241
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's possible.</font>

242
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Considering what happened today, 
you should be careful, Sooha.</font>

243
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know if that 
vampire targeting Sooha</font>

244
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has anything to do with our 
friends' disappearances,</font>

245
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we'd all better be on guard.</font>

246
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

247
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Solon.</font>

248
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you. You're the reason Sooha's safe.</font>

249
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I couldn't have done it alone.</font>

250
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But hearing you say that is, uh...</font>

251
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

252
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must've been hard having 
to keep that secret.</font>

253
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Telling everyone was 
no big deal after all.</font>

254
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They all laughed it off.</font>

255
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, that's rude.</font>

256
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

257
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like them, though.</font>

258
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,110
