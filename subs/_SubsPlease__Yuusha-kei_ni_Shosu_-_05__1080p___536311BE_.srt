00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Name: Tsav.</font>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's me!</font>

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No surname. Codename: Man-Eating Ghoul.</font>

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's pretty much how us
 Gwen Mohsa assassins roll.</font>

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eight people in a month, huh?</font>

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's quite disturbing.</font>

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, ya got it all wrong.</font>

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm an honest guy, 
so I'll lay it out straight for ya.</font>

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I killed <i>twelve</i> people. That's 50% more.</font>

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See how honest I am? I'm such a pushover.</font>

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm always the guy drawin' the short straw.</font>

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You killed all those people,
yet you feel no remorse at all?</font>

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, shit. Sorry. Were we talkin' 
about what's "right and wrong"?</font>

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was never great at 
that whole "morality" stuff.</font>

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do kinda feel like crap 
if I hafta kill someone I like,</font>

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but everythin' beyond that 
don't make no sense to me.</font>

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Gwen Mohsa brainwashing 
never took hold, either,</font>

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'cause that stuff seemed so silly and dumb.</font>

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're aware of how the Gwen Mohsa operate.</font>

20
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They use pain, drugs, pleasure...
all kinds of methods to make children—</font>

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, are ya thinkin'
 I'm some kinda chosen one?</font>

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gosh, that's such a big responsibility.</font>

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't afraid?</font>

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At best, you'll get a life sentence.
 At worst, death awaits.</font>

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you afraid?</font>

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm hella scared, man.</font>

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But bein' scared won't change much, 
so I'm just gonna enjoy it while I'm here.</font>

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That isn't a normal human reaction.</font>

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you lack imagination?</font>

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's mean, dude! I'm imaginin'
 the hell out of it all right now.</font>

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just...</font>

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't wrap my head around that stuff.</font>

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, outside of what's good for me
 and the people I like...</font>

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anythin' else that matters?</font>

35
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How interesting.</font>

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav, was it?</font>

37
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you choose who to kill?</font>

38
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno.</font>

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess those guys were just easy to kill.</font>

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Easy to kill"?</font>

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about this man, Taldy?</font>

42
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He vanished from the government office
 where he worked</font>

43
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in a mere seventy seconds
 in broad daylight.</font>

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying he was <i>easy</i> to kill?</font>

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mean the method. 
It's more about, uh, the feeling?</font>

46
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I can kill <i>anyone</i>
 if I set my mind to it.</font>

47
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So when I'm pickin' who to kill...</font>

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I pick the ones I won't feel bad about.</font>

49
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your standard for that?</font>

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I guess it's just kinda like instinct, yeah?</font>

51
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They just seem... y'know. Easy to kill?</font>

52
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Yes, yes.</font>

53
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magnificent.</font>

54
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav, my boy.</font>

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think death is too good for you.</font>

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A sentence worse than death?</font>

57
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I am sentencing you to be a hero.</font>

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No!</font>

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute! The hero penalty—</font>

60
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that's right.</font>

61
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't even be allowed to die.</font>

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Impact"><b><font size="45"><font color="#090000">Sentenced to Be a Hero</font></font></b></font></font>

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Impact"><b><font size="45"><font color="#110c0e">Sentenced to Be a Hero</font></font></b></font></font>

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? I was a total pushover 
when you got right down to it.</font>

65
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The more I'd look into a target, the more
 I'd think, "Whoa, I can't kill <i>this</i> guy!"</font>

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"He's got a wife and kids at home!" y'know?</font>

67
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}So I'd never kill the guy.</font>

68
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That man is also a hero?</font>

69
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Death has repeatedly failed to change him.</font>

70
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}But the organization'd get mad at me 
if I didn't have proof of the kill,</font>

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've heard this story 
a few dozen times, too.</font>

72
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}so I'd mess up some other dude's face 
and bring him back with me instead.</font>

73
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Total sweetheart stuff—</font>

74
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav.</font>

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up.</font>

76
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, sorry 'bout that, bro.</font>

77
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I talkin' your ear off again?</font>

78
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can we put a muzzle on this guy already?</font>

79
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll be talking all night 
if we have to share a room.</font>

80
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just can't stand it when it's quiet, y'know?</font>

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know my tragic past, right? 
I was basically tortured as part of my training.</font>

82
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}At times, they put me in this dungeon—</font>

83
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up.</font>

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make me say it again.</font>

85
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? Now Xylo's mad.</font>

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, shit! Sorry, bro!</font>

87
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, Dotta. Say you're sorry, too.</font>

88
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Why should <i>I</i> apologize? This is why 
I hate you. Get some perspective already.</font>

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Aw, seriously, Dotta. 
Ya gotta learn to take a joke.</font>

90
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've advanced quite far.</font>

91
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll likely arrive tonight at this rate.</font>

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So? How many knights 
of the Order are staying?</font>

94
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About fifty. All trustworthy knights.</font>

95
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still not enough.</font>

96
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even with the prisoners Venetim 
rounded up from Milnid Jail...</font>

97
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prisoners? Was a bribe involved?</font>

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. "They're all on death row, so do what
 you like with 'em," was the response.</font>

99
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same treatment prisoners get everywhere.</font>

100
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, look. Those are faerie scouts, I think.</font>

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real? Let's have a look-see.</font>

102
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks kinda doglike.</font>

103
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Must be a cir sith.</font>

104
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can see it from this distance?</font>

105
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man's vision is inhuman.</font>

106
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav, can you handle it?</font>

107
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess we'll find out.</font>

108
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just...</font>

109
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">don't kill me if I screw it up, 'kay?</font>

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Daisy made by Verkle Corp?</font>

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. His Majesty retuned it
 for long-range sniping.</font>

112
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, you sure about this?</font>

113
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he's in a pack, I'd hate to rile his buddies—</font>

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Can't you shoot without talking?</font>

115
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Copy that.</font>

116
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See that? Bullseye, right?</font>

117
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. But there's more coming.</font>

118
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep, on it.</font>

119
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can we trust them with this?</font>

120
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}More coming. Hurry.</font>

121
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're an obnoxious pair, 
but they'll get the job done.</font>

122
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Ah, it's hard to fire fast 
at this power and speed.</font>

123
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Particularly Tsav. 
I've never seen him miss a shot.</font>

124
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Just hurry!</font>

125
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's a hit.</font>

126
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let's go set the trap.</font>

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Some days, I think I'm a genius.</font>

128
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Okay, there's another.</font>

129
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Mr. Dotta never listens to me.</font>

130
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

131
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not giving up? 
Even in this situation?</font>

132
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some people want us dead. 
I'd rather not give them the satisfaction.</font>

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides...</font>

134
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All that stuff about her usefulness...</font>

135
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}There! There! Beside it, see?</font>

136
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd heard you were a man who imperiled 
his unit in his eagerness to climb the ranks.</font>

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Copy.</font>

138
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}There's some left.</font>

139
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Man, give a guy a break.</font>

140
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's funny. What noble family
 are <i>you</i> from, anyway?</font>

141
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Okay, we got most of them.</font>

142
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not a noble.</font>

143
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Time for a break?</font>

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That seems unlikely.</font>

145
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Galtuile let a commoner 
become an Order captain?</font>

146
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}No, there's another.</font>

147
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Gotcha.</font>

148
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh? Is that a faerie?</font>

149
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My uncle is a high priest.</font>

150
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Behind that boulder? Yeah, that's a faerie.</font>

151
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So a bigwig at the Temple, more or less.</font>

152
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explains why I didn't know.</font>

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bro, we're all done here.</font>

154
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every shot a hit.</font>

155
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dotta, Tsav, stay here and keep watch.</font>

156
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kivia, let's go.</font>

157
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Carry it all inside!</font>

158
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We need more materials here!</font>

159
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The captain's heading out 
already. Get it done!</font>

160
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're staying, Captain Kivia?</font>

161
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Staying to watch the heroes die seems in 
poor taste to me, but I'll pray for your safety.</font>

162
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall also pray for your well-being, Kivia.</font>

163
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pelmerry, stay close.</font>

164
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the goddess killer.</font>

165
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bastard.</font>

166
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Hord. I'll stay close.</font>

167
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hord, was I useful in my role?</font>

168
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were perfect. 
There can be no room for doubt.</font>

169
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

170
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't you say, "Well done, Pelmerry"?</font>

171
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, Pelmerry.</font>

173
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse us, then.</font>

174
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the ninth goddess?</font>

175
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. The Goddess Pelmerry.</font>

176
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's pacted with the captain of the Ninth Order
 of the Holy Knights, Hord Clivios. Know him?</font>

177
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His family holds a lot of land in the south.</font>

178
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Clivios-made wine is considered
 quite a delicacy.</font>

179
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

180
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What he's left in there 
is nothing at all like wine.</font>

181
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boy, looks dangerous.</font>

182
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we're luring the Demon Lord in here
and detonating the barrels, huh?</font>

183
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. To continuously kill
 Iblis with poison.</font>

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that'll kill all of us as well, huh?</font>

185
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, that sucks.</font>

186
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kinda ticks me off, even.</font>

187
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Might even drive me to kill someone!</font>

188
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What'd you just say?</font>

189
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You looking for a fight?!</font>

190
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You disgusting heroes 
had better watch what you—</font>

191
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop, Zofflec.</font>

192
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

193
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you have to kill anyone?</font>

194
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gotta vent my frustration.</font>

195
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me you've never kicked a rock 
when you're ticked off, bro.</font>

196
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans aren't rocks.</font>

197
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that's human exceptionalism!</font>

198
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans are just one part 
of our big wide world.</font>

199
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not good to give 'em special treatment.</font>

200
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have found you, Xylo!</font>

201
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, Goddess!</font>

202
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd you like holdin' down the fort?</font>

203
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spare me your pleasantries.</font>

204
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You left without telling me.</font>

205
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is conduct unbecoming of my knight.</font>

206
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goddess Teoritta.</font>

207
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were simply carrying out our duties.</font>

208
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please show us mercy.</font>

209
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo.</font>

210
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to have enjoyed 
scouting with Kivia.</font>

211
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no such thing as enjoyable scouting.</font>

212
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">G-Goddess Teoritta.</font>

213
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I picked these berries in the forest.</font>

214
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're quite sweet.</font>

215
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were picking berries...</font>

216
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in the forest...</font>

217
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>together</i>?!</font>

218
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must have indeed been enjoyable.</font>

219
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, I was merely carrying out my duties—</font>

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Do you have a map?</font>

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yup.</font>

222
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo! My knight!</font>

223
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I observed the Ninth Order 
of the Holy Knights at work.</font>

224
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Here, bro.</font>

225
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Thanks.</font>

226
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah?</font>

227
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not be so dismissive!</font>

228
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you hear me? Their goddess 
got her head patted <i>seven</i> times!</font>

229
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seven times in a <i>single</i> day!</font>

230
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your point?</font>

231
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have not had my head patted even <i>once</i>!</font>

232
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am not asking for a generous
 seven pats, but even half that...</font>

233
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have not had my head patted even once!</font>

234
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah?</font>

235
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Why do you not understand?!</font>

236
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Point is, we're short on people.</font>

237
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}My... My knight!</font>

238
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Please, <i>please</i> pat my head!</font>

239
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The faeries are gonna 
trample us at this rate.</font>

240
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain Kivia.</font>

241
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An unknown group of men
 is at the back gate.</font>

242
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say they're here to see this man.</font>

243
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To see me?</font>

244
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys...</font>

245
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We heard you'd been given 
an impossible task at the fortress.</font>

246
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely even insignificant miners like us
 can offer some assistance?</font>

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You realize what we're up against, right?</font>

248
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We want to help the king and the champions 
who saved our lives, as any man would.</font>

249
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but we're not royalty 
or champions of any kind.</font>

250
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go back to your families.</font>

251
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're doing this for ourselves as well.</font>

252
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We all hail from the villages in this area.</font>

253
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this fortress suffers 
the same fate as the mines,</font>

254
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll have lost both 
our livelihoods and our homes.</font>

255
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get how you feel, 
but after getting your lives ba—</font>

256
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome, my people!</font>

257
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}His Majesty!</font>

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are the warriors of my realm.</font>

259
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's really him!</font>

260
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}He's so brave and strong.</font>

261
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are the true heroes of this day.</font>

262
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty, don't encourage them.</font>

263
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not, Commander Xylo?</font>

264
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our forces are sorely depleted at the moment.</font>

265
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I realize that.</font>

266
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But these men are—</font>

267
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, I would never ask my people
 to throw their lives away.</font>

268
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I will accept their aid.</font>

269
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Under my instruction, they'll be able to handle 
even the most intricate sacred seal tuning.</font>

270
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With these loyal servants 
of the crown by our side,</font>

271
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this fortress will become <i>truly</i> impregnable.</font>

272
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we shall seize victory together!</font>

273
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

274
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Follow me!</font>

275
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us get to work!</font>

276
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Majesty! His Majesty! 
His Majesty! His Majesty!</font>

277
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's all gone according to plan so far.</font>

278
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then, Xylo...</font>

279
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please outline the plan.</font>

280
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tatsuya will seal off 
the underground passage.</font>

281
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want twenty of the Order's knights with him.</font>

282
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav will be at the back gate. 
Shoot anyone who comes close.</font>

283
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, that's my time to shine.</font>

284
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, where's Mr. Dotta?</font>

285
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's got another job to do.</font>

286
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, the miners will be
 by the front gate at the rear.</font>

287
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want them providing support
 to the Knights.</font>

288
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been ordered not to raise the drawbridge,
 so it'll be a dangerous location.</font>

289
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't push yourselves. 
Just try to hold out for half the day.</font>

290
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll work on tuning the sacred seals.</font>

291
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What will you be doing, Xylo?</font>

292
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going on the attack.</font>

293
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's my bro.</font>

294
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, listen.</font>

295
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold firm against the faeries' advance for 
as long as you can to draw out Iblis itself.</font>

296
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before it can reach the fortress, 
I'll use a trap we set in advance...</font>

297
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to finish it off.</font>

298
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the only way we all survive.</font>

299
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gimme a damn break!</font>

300
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll kill you!</font>

301
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't order us around!</font>

302
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why should we do what some hero tells us?</font>

303
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You people are subhuman.</font>

304
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You goddess-killing bastard!</font>

305
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make bro mad, okay?</font>

306
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna deal with the blowback.</font>

307
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why didn't you shoot <i>me</i>?</font>

308
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why? Because you're bigger 
and stronger than that guy.</font>

309
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be a bigger help to the cause.</font>

310
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bro—</font>

311
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav. I do think that was quite effective...</font>

312
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but don't do it again.</font>

313
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's right. I shoulda killed him right—</font>

314
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>

315
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wrong. Get him inside and use 
a sacred seal to stem the bleeding.</font>

316
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah? What did you want?</font>

317
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A sealed message arrived for you, Xylo.</font>

318
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's from—</font>

319
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want it. Burn it.</font>

320
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, but it's from Frenci Mastibolt.</font>

321
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Mastibolts are a family 
of night-gaunts from the south, yes?</font>

322
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They want to lend us some soldiers.</font>

323
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Personally, I think it'd be good
 to have their help.</font>

324
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think—</font>

325
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This conversation is over.</font>

326
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Of course.</font>

327
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although we could really use 
those two thousand soldiers.</font>

328
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly, we still haven't 
gotten Jayce and Rhyno here?</font>

329
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jayce said, "I refuse to push
 Neely like that. Go die."</font>

330
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rhyno simply ignored me.</font>

331
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He volunteered to be a hero, 
yet that aspect of him never changes.</font>

332
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the mercenaries?</font>

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried contacting them, 
but since we can't pay...</font>

334
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dotta's out raising money.</font>

335
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just hope we're in time.</font>

336
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Good morning. Haul it on in.</font>

337
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to get those miners 
off the front line.</font>

338
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd have to be the end of days
to force men like that into combat.</font>

339
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The end of days, huh?</font>

340
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Your Majesty, what do you want us to do next?</font>

341
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo.</font>

342
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hold it there. I'll adjust the placement.</font>

343
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Imagine, just as a thought experiment...</font>

344
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yes, sir.</font>

345
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there were people out there who really <i>did</i>
 want to put an end to humanity...</font>

346
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you think?</font>

347
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

348
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you enjoy conspiracy theories, Xylo?</font>

349
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is pointless. I know all about 
those bullshit articles you wrote.</font>

350
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About Demon Lord worshipers 
and coexistence advocates and that.</font>

351
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's clear you made it all up.</font>

352
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I understand why you'd think that.</font>

353
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if there <i>were</i> a faction out there</font>

354
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">worshiping Demon Lords 
or seeking coexistence with them,</font>

355
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and taking action to make sure 
humanity lose this fight...</font>

356
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't it explain this nonsensical plan?</font>

357
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If people like that really existed,</font>

358
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'd have to be the shittiest scumbags alive.</font>

359
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Demon Lord's still far away.</font>

360
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They have arrived, my knight.</font>

361
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coiste bodhars.</font>

362
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The vanguard of the horde.</font>

363
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

364
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's starting.</font>

365
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The future of humanity rides on this battle.</font>

366
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must protect our homeland.</font>

367
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All men, ready yourselves.</font>

368
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty, I told you 
to stay on support, damn it.</font>

369
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now...</font>

370
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire!</font>

371
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Activate barricades!</font>

372
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, men.</font>

373
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your gallant offensive 
has them on the back foot!</font>

374
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

375
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, prepare the next volley!</font>

376
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Majesty's awfully close 
to the front line.</font>

377
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Venetim, if somethin' happens to His Majesty,
 we're pretty much doomed, right?</font>

378
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}They're here! Fire!</font>

379
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I tried very hard to talk him out of it,</i></font>

380
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Damn it! Missed!</font>

381
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but he wouldn't listen.</i></font>

382
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Mr. Venetim, if you can't talk people outta stuff,
 what are you even bringing to the table?</font>

383
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}That's a very rude thing to say, Tsav.</i></font>

384
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Clear the way for the cavalry!</font>

385
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Support Captain Kivia!</font>

386
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire!</font>

387
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Let's go!</font>

388
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Knights of the Thirteenth Order...</font>

389
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Charge!</font>

390
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zofflec!</font>

391
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ma'am!</font>

392
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cavalry, turn back!</font>

393
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep harrying them! 
Don't let them near the fortress!</font>

394
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They really are quite impressive.</font>

395
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Bro, what's that over there?</i></font>

396
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that...</font>

397
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah. I see it.</i></font>

398
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,650
