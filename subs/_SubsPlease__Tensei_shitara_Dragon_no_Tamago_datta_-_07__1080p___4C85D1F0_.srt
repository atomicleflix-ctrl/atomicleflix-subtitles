<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Uh, nice?</font>

141
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, not nice!</font>

142
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hurry up and give him the antidote,
please!</font>

143
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I get you're frustrated
with the Orangurangs.</font>

144
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But poisoning them like that
is taking it too far.</font>

145
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, I get it.</font>

146
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sorry I haven't been giving you
any attention.</font>

147
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I know!</font>

148
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's go out hunting today, 'kay?</font>

149
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You and I can team up!</font>

150
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Like we always do!</font>

151
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She'll feel better if we spend
the whole day together, I'm sure of it!</font>

152
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's been a few days since
those adventurers went into the forest,</font>

153
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but there's been absolutely
no word from them.</font>

154
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's up to me.</font>

155
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have to look for Mr. Doz.</font>

156
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm sorry, Miss Marielle.</font>

157
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now that I think about it, I'm just
one level away from evolving again.</font>

158
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So I wanna farm more experience.</font>

159
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And get more stuff to spruce up my cave.</font>

160
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And find more fruits and veggies!</font>

161
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Man, exploring the forest is really fun!</font>

162
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You agree right, Black Lizard?</font>

163
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh? What's got you down?</font>

164
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Everybody else is having a good time.</font>

165
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They just can't get enough
of using those weapons, huh?</font>

166
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Seems like it gives
their attack power a pretty big boost.</font>

167
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't wait to see
how strong they are now!</font>

168
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let me know if you spot any prey.</font>

169
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, Black Lizard?</font>

170
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You good? Uh...</font>

171
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Black Lizard? Buddy?</font>

172
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Weird. Did I do something wrong?</font>

173
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's nothing new, but it still sucks
that we don't speak the same language.</font>

174
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's wrong?! An enemy?</font>

175
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This'll be a good warm up.</font>

176
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's get 'em!</font>

177
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoa! They can really kick butt!</font>

178
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't you think they're amazing?</font>

179
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Eh?</font>

180
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait a second, hey!</font>

181
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No luck here, either.</font>

182
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I think I've gone a little too far.</font>

183
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I need to turn back soon.</font>

184
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mr. Doz!</font>

185
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please wait!</font>

186
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mr. Doz! Mr. Doz!</font>

187
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm sorry for giving
the Orangurangs so much attention.</font>

188
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I'm their boss now, you know?</font>

189
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's nothing personal, okay?</font>

190
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Black Lizard...</font>

191
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay!</font>

192
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Next time,
we'll go hunting all by ourselves.</font>

193
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The others will stay in the cave.</font>

194
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sound good?</font>

195
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll keep you safe.</font>

196
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's a promise!</font>

197
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just so you know,</font>

198
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I consider you the
most important thing in my life right now.</font>

199
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No matter what happens in the future,
that will never change.</font>

200
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ever.</font>

201
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That voice. I've heard it before.</font>

202
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's Myria!</font>

203
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is she in trouble again?!</font>

204
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whatever the case, I gotta get to her!</font>

205
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But what if she's with other humans?</font>

206
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, come on!</font>

207
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm not a threat to you!</font>

208
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Help!</font>

209
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, I'm just-</font>

210
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please, listen to me!</font>

211
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm trying to help her!</font>

212
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You just stay here. Got it?</font>

213
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hang tight, Myria! I'm on the way!</font>

214
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw, jeez!</font>

215
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I told you to stay put!</font>

216
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Better speed up!</font>

217
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey!</font>

218
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's dangerous
to go that fast at your level!</font>

219
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">See? What did I tell you?!</font>

220
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are you all right?!</font>

221
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You've got plenty of HP left. Good.</font>

222
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Myria!</font>

223
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm sorry.</font>

224
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I meant it when I said
you're important to me, Black Lizard.</font>

225
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But if Myria is in danger,
I have to help her!</font>

226
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The title Itty Bitty Hero has gone
from level two to level three.</font>

227
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wrongdoer has gone
from level three to level four.</font>

228
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gee, thanks, Divine Voice.</font>

229
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have the most
charming personality ever.</font>

230
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Myria, please be okay!</font>

231
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I just barely made it in time.</font>

232
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That figures.
She doesn't recognize me.</font>

233
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why would she?</font>

234
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mahawolf. Rank D-.</font>

235
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It can use its third eye</font>

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">to share visual information
with nearby members of the pack.</font>

237
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They use this ability
to cooperate and hunt down prey.</font>

238
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay. So, I should expect
more of them coming soon.</font>

239
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What are their stats?</font>

240
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There is some information
that the View Stats skill</font>

245
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hold up, I remember
something like this happening before.</font>

246
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Baby Breath!</font>

247
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh crud!</font>

248
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I release a poison powder

254
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maybe because my skill
is such a low level?</font>

255
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">N-no...</font>

256
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Stay away from me!</font>

257
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sigh.</font>

258

getting robbed by bandits.</font>

260
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,790
