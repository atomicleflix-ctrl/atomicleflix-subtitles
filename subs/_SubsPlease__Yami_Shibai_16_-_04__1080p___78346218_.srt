00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Step right up and have a look...</font>

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time for Yamishibai.</font>

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,490
<font face="Times New Roman" size="44" color="#593826"><b>{\an8}<font color="#5e3623"><font color="#5c352c">Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai</font></font></b></font>

00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,490
<font face="Times New Roman" size="22" color="#3d2b20"><font color="#2b1f0a">Following</font></font>

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the story of a certain woman 
who runs a tailoring shop...</font>

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:26,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font color="#7b6940"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Musubu Tailor</b></font></font></font>

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse us.</font>

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome.</font>

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you need something patched up?</font>

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I was hoping you could make this 
kimono into a necktie or something.</font>

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't the pattern wonderful?</font>

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it'll look great on you, Ryuuta!</font>

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me just take a look.</font>

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a fine piece, 
but I do see holes and stains.</font>

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh... the price isn't a concern.</font>

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'll wait as long as it takes.</font>

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a kimono with... a lot of history.</font>

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are lots just like it 
at your place, though.</font>

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I'll see to it.</font>

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if it belonged to 
someone important to him.</font>

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This material really is gorgeous, 
now that I get another look at it.</font>

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The dying and pattern, too.</font>

24
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's an odd place for all these seams.</font>

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're very sturdy...</font>

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please... Please... Please...</font>

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to follow him. 
I can't stop worrying about him...</font>

28
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He always attracts the 
wrong kind of attention...</font>

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This kimono... belonged to you?</font>

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of this... is my own hair, and that 
of someone I care very much about.</font>

32
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of my kimonos contain hair 
from the both of us.</font>

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please... include the hair, whatever 
you do, so we won't be separated...</font>

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my bond to him...</font>

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you are! 
This is the finished product.</font>

36
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks fantastic!</font>

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you like it.</font>

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's so nice! I want something like it!</font>

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's plenty of material left, 
so can I have something, too?</font>

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryuuta? Ryuuta, pay attention to me!</font>

41
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you don't mind me asking, but 
that kimono belonged to your wife, yes?</font>

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must've really loved it.</font>

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can tell it was handled with great care.</font>

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

45
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My Kimiyo loved kimonos...</font>

46
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I was bad at storing them, 
and now they're all worn out.</font>

47
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel so guilty...</font>

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryuuta? Behind you! 
There's something behind you!</font>

49
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Don't look at me!</font>

50
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go away. He can't even see you.</font>

51
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way... No way!</font>

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take better care of this.</font>

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That way I'll always have Kimiyo with me.</font>

54
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right, Ryuuta. I'll be 
following you forever and ever...</font>

55
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I subtly sewed some of the hair 
into the back of the necktie.</font>

56
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That our little secret, ma'am.</font>

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forever and ever and ever...</font>

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,900
<font face="Times New Roman" size="44" color="#593826"><b>{\an8}<font size="34">Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai</font></b></font>

59
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The end.</font>
