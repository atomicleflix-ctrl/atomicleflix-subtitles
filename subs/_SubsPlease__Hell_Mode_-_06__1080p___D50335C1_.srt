00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, whaddya want from us this time?</font>

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here's the thing. From what I've been told,
the baron will paying us a visit next month.</font>

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The baron himself?!</font>

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">More like the clown who thinks it's cool
to just demand 20 boars from us.</font>

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He's expressed interest in observing
your boar hunts firsthand.</font>

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Great. First he wants more boars, now he wants
a show. Will the surprises never stop?</font>

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, that's fine with me.</font>

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But why ask Allen to join us?</font>

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let me explain. We need someone to serve
as a tour guide for the baron during his stay.</font>

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?</font>

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You want me?</font>

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why not just have your own son do it?</font>

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My Pelomas isn't suited to the task, I'm afraid.</font>

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You can say that again.</font>

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm hoping Allen can help us
show the baron hospitality starting with dinner</font>

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">the night before the hunt.</font>

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, basically, he wants me to entertain
the big cheese while he's in town.</font>

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And he's trying to win me over
with these molmo fruits.</font>

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sorry, pal. But I ain't that cheap!</font>

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've heard it was Allen's clever ideas
that led to the success of your hunts last year.</font>

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm sure he can handle this important job.</font>

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What do you say, Allen?</font>

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Frankly, I couldn't care less about the baron.</font>

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I won't get any chances
to leave the village as a serf.</font>

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And it'll take 10 years of hunting boars and
albaherons before I can reach commoner status...</font>

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You can refuse if you want, okay?</font>

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I remember right, there was one more ticket
to rising the social ladder...</font>

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The baron can gift people with commoner status.</font>

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Alright, then.</font>

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's okay, Dad. I'll be the baron's tour guide!</font>

32
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Welcome! We're honored
to have you, Baron Granvelle.</font>

33
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thanks for the warm welcome.</font>

34
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course!</font>

35
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come, Cecil.</font>

36
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay.</font>

37
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Chief Deboji. I appreciate the work that you've
put in over the years to establish Krena Village.</font>

38
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's been 15 years since
the Land Reclamation Decree.</font>

39
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And there has been no greater success
than here in the Granvelle fiefdom.</font>

40
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you, milord.</font>

41
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Also, I must apologize
for all the fuss over boar meat.</font>

42
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I knew asking for more would burden you unduly.</font>

43
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I simply could not refuse an order
from His Majesty.</font>

44
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">F-f-from the King, you say?!</font>

45
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Technically speaking, yes.</font>

46
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But the blame truly lies with Viscount Carnel.</font>

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That scoundrel!</font>

48
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Calling attention to the boar hunts
while we're in front of the King!</font>

49
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Milord. Your tone is frightening the chieftain.</font>

50
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My God! Exquisite!</font>

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Father! This meat is quite delicious!</font>

52
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What kind of meat is this, Chief Deboji?</font>

53
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh? Oh, um, well...</font>

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I may interrupt, this is a dish of albaheron.</font>

55
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The meat is from one hunted just yesterday.</font>

56
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Only the freshest ingredients for you, milord.</font>

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It uses the breast meat, thigh meat,
and liver, all flavored with a blend of herbs.</font>

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah, I see.</font>

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is this your son, Chief Deboji?</font>

60
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, actually. This is the son of Rodin, one of...</font>

61
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh! Rodin the Boar Hunter's son, eh?</font>

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now I remember why your black hair
and eyes seem familiar.</font>

63
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's good to see you again, Sir Zenof.</font>

64
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I will be serving as your guide
during tomorrow's hunt.</font>

65
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Such a well-mannered young man.</font>

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is his father a former member of the knighthood?</font>

67
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, milord. He comes from a family of serfs.</font>

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Serfs?! You let one of them into your guest hall?!</font>

69
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Cecil! You know that serfs
are fair members of our fiefdom.</font>

70
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't treat them like some kind of animal.</font>

71
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Right. I'm very sorry, Father.</font>

72
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why do I get the stink eye?</font>

73
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Son of Rodin.</font>

74
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I hope you're ready to acquaint us
on the finer details during tomorrow's hunt.</font>

75
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes. Of course, sir.</font>

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wrangling 20 boars in one year is a steep goal.</font>

77
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Should it prove too difficult,
then my knights will take over the hunts.</font>

78
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Uh-huh.</font>

79
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not convinced we serfs have what it takes, are ya?</font>

80
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That would be most wonderful, Zenof!</font>

81
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I asked my father to let me tag along
because I wanted to see a great boar up close,</font>

82
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but seeing the knights slay
one would be even better!</font>

83
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sure.</font>

84
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Once you've shown them the fundamentals,</font>

85
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">the knights can handle
the responsibility of hunting.</font>

86
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I beg your pardon, milord.
But 20 boars is a paltry number.</font>

87
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?!</font>

88
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We will have no problems meeting the quota.</font>

89
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Our performance tomorrow
should convince you of that.</font>

90
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Zenof. I'm leaving Cecil under your protection.
I expect you to keep her safe.</font>

91
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course, my lord. It shall be done.</font>

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is so exciting, Sebas!</font>

93
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Indeed, milady.</font>

94
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here we are. You'll be able to see
all of today's action from atop this watchtower.</font>

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please head on up.</font>

96
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hmph!</font>

97
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow, what a great view!</font>

98
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Indeed. Trees as far as the eye can see.</font>

99
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This is the forest where the great boars nest.</font>

100
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The hunters have arrived.</font>

101
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah, I see they've got armor!</font>

102
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We made good use of the boars from last year.</font>

103
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That armor was forged
from leftover pelts, bones, and fangs.</font>

104
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I was asked to thank you
for granting permission, milord.</font>

105
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">On behalf of my father, Rodin.</font>

106
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, let's move out!</font>

107
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What are they doing?</font>

108
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Their job is to lure boars
into the hunting grounds.</font>

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Speed is a key factor,
so they are only lightly equipped.</font>

110
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh.</font>

111
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please be patient as it may take time to lure
the boars, despite how many live in the forest.</font>

112
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fair enough.</font>

113
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That reminds me, Allen.</font>

114
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How is the Sword Lord, Krena, fairing these days?</font>

115
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah, she's doing great!</font>

116
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wonderful.</font>

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let her know a tutor will be dispatched
here the spring after next to help her study</font>

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">for the Academy entrance exam.</font>

119
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Understood.</font>

120
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's hard to imagine Krena studying for anything.</font>

121
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's gonna look so silly!</font>

122
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here comes the first one!</font>

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Heads up!</font>

124
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Heave-ho!</font>

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">As you can see, we start by boxing them in.</font>

126
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Those large shields are made from two layers</font>

127
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">of the toughest part of the boar hide,
found on its back.</font>

128
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Strike team, you're up!</font>

129
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Long spear team!</font>

130
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The long spear team consists of the least
experienced members, who just joined last year.</font>

131
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The frontliners with the toughest job
are the ones wearing armor, I see.</font>

132
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes. It also covers their backs to prevent injury
if one of the long spear team misses the target.</font>

133
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The boar's neck is the best place to strike.</font>

134
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That was a fatal blow.</font>

135
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ugh...</font>

136
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wow. Most impressive.</font>

137
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Milady! Milady!</font>

138
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">These men may not be knights, Your Lordship,</font>

139
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but I believe they are worthy
of being called warriors.</font>

140
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes, I must applaud their fighting prowess.</font>

141
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It seems there will be no problem with-</font>

142
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Incoming!</font>

143
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Two boars at once?!</font>

144
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Leibrand, make ready to assist!</font>

145
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yessir!</font>

146
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please wait.</font>

147
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There is no need to panic.</font>

148
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The hunting team is trained to deal
with these situations.</font>

149
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But even so!</font>

150
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please let them handle it.</font>

151
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Stick to your training and split into two groups!</font>

152
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Gerda and I will take the lead! Move out!</font>

153
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Every hunter worth their salt
knows to kill all the game they bait.</font>

154
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Letting anything escape is folly.</font>

155
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But for the past 10 years, my dad
and the other serfs haven't been able to do that.</font>

156
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Mainly due to their lack of armor.</font>

157
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sixty percent of their hard-earned
boar meat gets taken as tax.</font>

158
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And they have to exchange
the rest for daily necessities.</font>

159
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Spears were the only thing
they could afford to upgrade.</font>

160
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">However, it's possible for them
to create some leeway by mastering</font>

161
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">the most efficient hunting strategy.</font>

162
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That allows for gradual equipment upgrades,
which then raises their efficiency even higher.</font>

163
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's the most basic of basics!</font>

164
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Milady!</font>

165
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Not again!</font>

166
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's three boars down. All's going well!</font>

167
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank God. Watching them fight two at once
still has me sweating bullets.</font>

168
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That leaves 17 more to go.</font>

169
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, milord. Just 10, actually.</font>

170
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Really?!</font>

171
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Seven boars had already been hunted this year
before you graced us with your presence.</font>

172
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I imagine we'll have filled the quota
by this time next month!</font>

173
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You don't say!</font>

174
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Doesn't seem like my knights
will be needed, after all.</font>

175
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you. My father and the others
will be happy to hear it.</font>

176
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I may, we actually have two requests
to make of you, milord.</font>

177
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is that so? What are they?</font>

178
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For starters, we humbly ask for permission
to make two more of the shield walls.</font>

179
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In the interest of hunting
even more next year, I assume?</font>

180
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Exactly.</font>

181
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Very well. What else?</font>

182
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Secondly, we want to procure goods
not available in the village.</font>

183
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Specifically... liquor.</font>

184
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Liquor?</font>

185
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We would like your permission to trade in liquor
and allow its distribution among the serfs.</font>

186
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But what for?</font>

187
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">As more and more boars are hunted,</font>

188
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">there is a real concern that the
resulting abundance of meat</font>

189
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">will reduce its value in the village.</font>

190
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Exchanging the meat for imported liquor
instead will help to prevent a market crash.</font>

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why liquor specifically?</font>

192
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Given his position, this something
that Sir Zenof may understand better, but...</font>

193
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">the hunters must risk their lives to be effective.</font>

194
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I get it. You need the liquor
to help keep their morale high, yes?</font>

195
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Precisely.</font>

196
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's how my father explained it to me.</font>

197
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your Lordship. I am of the mind
that their request stands to very good reason.</font>

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then I shall consider it favorably.</font>

199
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen, was it?</font>

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I must say, you have done a splendid job today.</font>

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you, milord.</font>

202
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, you!</font>

203
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You were lucky to get any praise from my father!
Don't let it go to your head!</font>

204
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I mean, you barely even...</font>

205
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Careful, milady!</font>

206
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hmph!</font>

207
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let us be on our way, milady.</font>

208
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeesh. Talk about a delicate damsel.</font>

209
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Go back to your cushy city life.</font>

210
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's probably the last I see of her.</font>

211
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Rodin. Gerda.</font>

212
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yessir!</font>

213
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You've truly shown me what you're capable of.</font>

214
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I must commend your amazing hunting skills.</font>

215
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Your accomplishments deserve to be rewarded.
I wouldn't make a good baron otherwise.</font>

216
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw, yeah! Now you're talking!</font>

217
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't bother with money!
We want social mobility, baby! Come on commoner!</font>

218
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Rodin. Gerda. I hereby elevate you
and your families... to commoner status!</font>

219
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I expect that you'll continue to work hard.</font>

220
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yessir! Thank you very much!</font>

221
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you, milord!</font>

222
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">HELL YES!</font>

223
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Goodbye serfdom! Hello commoner status!</font>

224
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now I can go hunting outside the village limits!</font>

225
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've dreamed about this moment
countless times over the past eight years!</font>

226
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My first stop: the White Dragon Mountains
to go dragon hunting!</font>

227
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For any serfs who have taken part
in the hunts for over 10 years,</font>

228
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I shall also grant the same status.</font>

229
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Do a thorough check and determine
who among your team are eligible.</font>

230
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yessir!</font>

231
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I foresee no problems
fulfilling His Majesty's order.</font>

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now I can return to the city and rest easy.</font>

233
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Milord.</font>

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What is it?</font>

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I believe there was one more thing
His Majesty was keen to know.</font>

236
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah! I nearly forgot!</font>

237
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">His Majesty wishes to promote Krena Village
as a shining example for the rest of the kingdom.</font>

238
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thus, he asked me for the details
of how the boar hunts began.</font>

239
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Y-you want to know the history behind it?</font>

240
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I haven't heard that story, myself.</font>

241
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's actually a sore subject
for Rodin, Your Lordship.</font>

242
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">May I tell it in his stead?</font>

243
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">By all means.</font>

244
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It all started in spring... 13 years ago...</font>

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
<font size="27"><b>{\an7}THE HARDCORE GAMER DOMINATES</b></font>

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
<font size="27"><b>{\an7}IN ANOTHER WORLD WITH GARBAGE BALANCING</b></font>

247
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">About 100 serfs from nearby villages
relocated here to help develop the land</font>

248
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">as part of the Reclamation Decree.</font>

249
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">After six months of hard work,
we had cleared out a good chunk of the forest.</font>

250
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Fall was on the horizon when disaster struck.</font>

251
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A great boar came out of nowhere and attacked us,</font>

252
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">devouring most of the wheat and potatoes
that we had set aside for winter.</font>

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The majority of serfs had chosen
to brave the frontier</font>

254
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">after struggling to obtain food
in their old villages.</font>

255
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Which meant going back wasn't an option.</font>

256
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's when Rodin spoke up.</font>

257
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He proposed we hunt the boars for meat.</font>

258
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Back then, we didn't have any of the weapons,
armor, or knowledge that we do now.</font>

259
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In spite of that, all the men united to go hunting
with pickaxes and hoes as weapons,</font>

260
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and we managed to kill a single boar.</font>

261
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That sounds like a story to pride yourself on.</font>

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You came together to accomplish a difficult task.</font>

263
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The problem is... we lost a friend in the process.</font>

264
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">After defeating the boar, we overcame
a Trial of the Gods and our injuries were healed.</font>

265
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But our friend wasn't as fortunate.</font>

266
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've told Rodin over and over again
that he shouldn't blame himself,</font>

267
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but he just won't hear it.</font>

268
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So that's it.</font>

269
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now I understand why Dad
covered for that commoner.</font>

270
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's because he once lost a friend the same way.</font>

271
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hrm. I'm sorry to dredge up such a painful memory.</font>

272
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's okay.</font>

273
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But listen, Rodin. Although lives were lost,
the village could never have come this far</font>

274
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">without your prudent actions.</font>

275
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let me honor the bravery of your youth
with one more reward.</font>

276
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ask of me whatever you wish.</font>

277
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?!</font>

278
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, sweet! That triggered a bonus event!</font>

279
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A nice cherry on top before we wrap this up!</font>

280
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Congratulations, Dad! Ask him for some liquor!</font>

281
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, Baron Granvelle... I do have one request.</font>

282
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Would you please allow my son
to work at your estate?</font>

283
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?!</font>

284
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen has a better head
on his shoulders than I do.</font>

285
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Any job is fine, even just hallboy.</font>

286
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I promise that he'll be an asset!</font>

287
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh? Wait.</font>

288
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No! Bad idea, Dad!</font>

289
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That is not what I had in mind!
It... it could ruin everything!</font>

290
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hmm. Work at my estate, eh?</font>

291
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sebas?</font>

292
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I have no problems with it.
He seems plenty clever to me.</font>

293
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Say no, dammit!</font>

294
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let me live my dream of hunting legendary dragons!</font>

295
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll have even LESS freedom living with the baron!</font>

296
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">G-g-g-gotta think. Must be a way outta this.</font>

297
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A hallboy, eh? No, that won't do.</font>

298
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Crap, crap, crap. Please don't...</font>

299
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Crap, crap, crap. Please don't...</font>

300
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen, son of Rodin.</font>

301
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I hereby appoint you...
as manservant of the Granvelle Family.</font>

302
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">WHAT?!</font>

303
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">M-manservant?! Really, milord?!</font>

304
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You can't be serious, Father!</font>

305
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just the idea of having a serf
in our house makes me sick!</font>

306
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">He is a commoner now, milady.</font>

307
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">How are hallboy and manservant any different?!</font>

308
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait, forget that!
I need to get myself out of this mess!</font>

309
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Think! Come up with some excuse!</font>

310
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen!</font>

311
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I look forward to serving you, milord...</font>

312
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Damn. There's just no way I can turn it down.</font>

313
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm boned.</font>

314
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All set. It looks great on you, Allen.</font>

315
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thanks, Mom.</font>

316
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw, Allen. You really gotta go?</font>

317
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah. Take care of yourself, Krena.</font>

318
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, Krena. How about one more duel before I go?</font>

319
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yay!</font>

320
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I am Krena the Fierce! Have at thee!</font>

321
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I am Allen, manservant to Baron Granvelle!</font>

322
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sword Lord Krena! Do your worst!</font>

323
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here I come!</font>

324
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What a good way for them to say goodbye.</font>

325
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's for sure.</font>

326
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Tugs at the heartstrings.</font>

327
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's going on?</font>

328
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoa, is Allen... overpowering Krena?!</font>

329
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I used nearly all the magic stones that I
had stocked up and created 20 copies of Hawkins.</font>

330
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I went all in on agility!</font>

331
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">When Krena turns 12,
she'll leave to study in Academy City.</font>

332
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then she'll go into the royal service.</font>

333
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's possible we'll never see each other again.</font>

334
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Did I just lose...?</font>

335
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Sword Lord Krena.</font>

336
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I think we can both agree that this was a draw.</font>

337
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It was?</font>

338
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll settle this in the future,
when we meet again!</font>

339
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay! I'm gonna win for sure, Allen!</font>

340
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now there's the smile I wanted to see.</font>

341
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen.</font>

342
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Take care not to get sick, okay?</font>

343
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay.</font>

344
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No more tears, Mash.</font>

345
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have to step up to protect Mom and Myulla now!</font>

346
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey. Say goodbye to Myulla, too.</font>

347
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Myulla. Grow up nice and big, okay?</font>

348
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I still remember helping deliver you
as a baby, kiddo. It makes me sad to see you go.</font>

349
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shucks, Miss Mathilda. Thank you.</font>

350
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Stay safe, Allen.</font>

351
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I will.</font>

352
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thanks for everything!</font>

353
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, don't push me.</font>

354
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Aw, crap!</font>

355
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dogora?</font>

356
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And Pelomas?</font>

357
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Uh, hi.</font>

358
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Here.</font>

359
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's for me?</font>

360
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hmph! Don't say I never gave you nothin'!</font>

361
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That kid's a riot!</font>

362
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And generous to boot!</font>

363
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah!</font>

364
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's get going, Allen.</font>

365
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Right.</font>

366
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Allen.</font>

367
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Manservant is only the first step for you.</font>

368
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Work hard and you'll go places.</font>

369
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yeah. I'll do my best!</font>

370
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey! They're almost ready to leave!</font>

371
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Bye, son. Make me proud.</font>

372
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come home if it gets too tough, okay?</font>

373
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Goodbye, everybody.</font>
