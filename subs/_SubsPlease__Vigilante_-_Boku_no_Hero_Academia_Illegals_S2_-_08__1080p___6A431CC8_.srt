<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep fighting, Shota! Keep fighting!</font>

150
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chew on this!</font>

151
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it.</font>

152
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I actually did it, Shirakumo!</font>

153
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe a single 
rookie took down that giant.</font>

154
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. It was a team effort.</font>

155
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My partner kept encouraging me.</font>

156
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shirakumo...</font>

157
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kayama, how badly hurt is Shirakumo?</font>

158
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was cheering me on before, 
so it can't be that bad...</font>

159
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or can it? Should we get 
to the hospital, then?</font>

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamada! That speaker is Shirakumo's.</font>

161
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've gotta take it to him.</font>

162
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, this thing's busted.</font>

163
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That can't be. Shirakumo 
was just on it...</font>

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That'd mean he was cheering you on 
through this speaker until his last breath.</font>

165
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I don't think that's it.</font>

166
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you were pushing yourself, 
and doing it through this speaker.</font>

167
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the heat of combat, that 
kind of thing can happen.</font>

168
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That can't be it. He 
told me I could do it.</font>

169
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"You can do it, Shota."</font>

170
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what kept me fighting...</font>

171
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need a stretcher, now!</font>

172
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aizawa.</font>

173
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stood your ground against 
a villain that took down</font>

174
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a first-rate team of pros, and won.</font>

175
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All on your own.</font>

176
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be proud, Aizawa.</font>

177
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't be proud of this, 
then what else is there?</font>

178
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sensoji, man... I really do 
envy how simple you are.</font>

179
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard Shirakumo's voice.</font>

180
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

181
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it was him.</font>

182
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was cheering me on.</font>

184
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

185
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's always had my back, from 
the day we first met.</font>

186
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like today. The entire time!</font>

187
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I know.</font>

188
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's starting to rain harder.</font>

189
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aizawa, Yamada,</font>

190
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">come on inside already.</font>

191
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't need you getting sick.</font>

192
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Kayama, but it...</font>

193
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It matches our state of mind.</font>

194
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shota! It's when you screw up that you 
need to keep it light like you always do.</font>

195
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The three of us start our own agency 
and go independent. That's my plan.</font>

196
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet you'd be great fit for a 
job where you look after kids.</font>

197
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think that you could do anything 
if you were motivated!</font>

198
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's, like, when there's three 
of us, if anybody messes up,</font>

199
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the other two can cover for them.</font>

200
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I get the feeling the three 
of us can handle anything!</font>

201
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about I lend you my goggles?</font>

202
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it, Shota. 
Keep fighting, Shota!</font>

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can live in the café!</font>

265
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Serving food and drinks with 
a pet around? I dunno.</font>

266
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. I like it.</font>

267
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We make it one of them 
fancypants cat cafés,</font>

268
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and people will be lining up to get in!</font>

269
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Schoolgirls, for example.</font>

270
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really think schoolgirls are gonna 
wanna hit up a place filled with monsters?</font>

271
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't know unless we try!</font>

272
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's a great idea! 
Let's make it our dream café!</font>

273
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? He gets it!</font>

274
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you, we need roof access!</font>

275
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where else are we gonna eat lunch?</font>

276
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a really weird assumption.</font>

277
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figure we get a soundproof studio.</font>

278
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna really cut loose with 
my voice, every now and then!</font>

279
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hup! Is there anything you 
need for our agency, Shota?</font>

280
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A cat tower.</font>

281
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're gonna have an agency cat, huh?</font>

282
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get it! You wanna take Sushi in, huh?</font>

283
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels irresponsible to 
leave him with Kayama.</font>

284
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I figure the three of us 
can probably look after him...</font>

285
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

286
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I g-g-g-guess it sounds good!</font>

287
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably for the best...</font>

288
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What any one of us can't 
handle, two of us can.</font>

289
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And together, the three 
of us can do anything.</font>

290
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can save anyone.</font>

291
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we'll start with a single cat.</font>

292
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was my plan back then...</font>

293
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Eraser.</font>

294
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eraser?</font>

295
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit acting like a stranger 
and tell us what you think.</font>

296
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've got a spot reserved 
for you—right here.</font>

297
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next to the can.</font>

298
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you come to mooch coffee off 
us, come through the back, okay?</font>

299
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having a spooky-looking 
guy like you around</font>

300
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is bound to be bad for 
business otherwise.</font>

301
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if it's this dude, having a hero
around is bound to be good for security.</font>

302
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll give us an air of 
respectability, y'know?</font>

303
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come and visit this little guy, okay?</font>

304
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just glad we found 
a place for the kitten.</font>

305
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess no matter how hard it seems at 
first, things have a way of working out!</font>

306
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's cleared up.</font>

307
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't even notice the sun was out.</font>

308
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you talking about, man?</font>

309
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A cat café, huh?</font>

310
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a good plan.</font>

311
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll drop by to check 
on the cat sometimes.</font>

312
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,910
<font size="20"><b>{\an7}<font color="#373b3d"><font size="17">Today's Sushi</font></font></b></font>

313
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With Captain Celebrity's issues 
back home taken care of,</font>

314
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's getting ready to return to America.</font>

315
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we're going to be a part of 
the final event planned for him!</font>

316
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next Time: Farewell Party.</font>

317
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Captain!</font>
