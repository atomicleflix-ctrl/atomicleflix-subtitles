4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised... you figured it out.</font>

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I was fooled, too... until 
I realized it during today's meeting.</font>

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But didn't you investigate me 
as the Engineer?</font>

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to say it,</font>

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but even humans lie...</font>

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,720

23
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-About what?
-Aren't you just naked, Shigemichi?</font>

24
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-I'm not!
-Wait, really?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-I'm wearing clothes here!
-Ah, Yuri.</font>

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey. Did you recover already?</font>

27
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were hurt pretty badly, weren't you?</font>

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Yeah...</font>

29
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, there was, like, stuff sticking out.</font>

30
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, bud. Don't talk about 
gross stuff when we're eating here.</font>

31
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see... So I was hurt.</i></font>

32
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why I got carried into the

35
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better thank Setsu, too, Yuri.</font>

36
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank Setsu?</font>

37
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah! If it weren't for Setsu,</font>

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we wouldn't have been 
able to escape Liu-An</font>

39
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without being infected by the Gnosia.</font>

40
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm grateful to Setsu, too.</font>

41
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just, my gratitude 
kinda morphed into lust.</font>

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know, maybe it was a 
mistake to save Sha-ming.</font>

43
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may be right.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um...</font>

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm? What's up?</font>

47
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, um... Are we gonna have the meeting?</font>

48
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meeting?</font>

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For what?</font>

50
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er... Never mind.</font>

51
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri...</font>

52
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you, like, lose your 
memories, or something?</font>

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know my name?</font>

54
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, yeah, I'm fine. You're SQ, right?</font>

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! Well done, lovely Yuri!</font>

56
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. I have to use the bathroom.</font>

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's no meeting.</i></font>

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They didn't even know what 
I meant by "meeting."</i></font>

59
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then...</i></font>

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">LeVi.</font>

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How may I assist you?</i></font>

62
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you detect any Gnosia 
on board the ship?</font>

63
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Negative. I do not.</i></font>

64
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Due to Setsu's quick guidance,</i></font>

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>this vessel successfully avoided 
any Gnosia infection.</i></font>

66
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I knew it.</i></font>

67
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that's what's going on.</i></font>

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is a world line where no one's 
been infected by the Gnosia.</i></font>

69
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe the truth is here.</i></font>

70
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you refrain from 
making me repeat myself?</font>

71
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's absolutely clear that the optimal 
choice is to set course for Glyze.</font>

72
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio, please... It's okay.</font>

73
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to hear your opinion about this, 
Setsu, since you're in the military.</font>

74
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'll entertain a foolish old man's 
idea, I think we should set course</font>

76
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for a nearby military base so that we can 
notify the proper authorities of Liu-An.</font>

77
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The "foolish" part is right.</font>

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we end up in military custody, 
just think of all the reports,</font>

79
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">inspections, and who knows what else? 
I can't imagine how long they'll hold us.</font>

80
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you heard them.</font>

81
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right...</font>

82
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu should be the one to decide.</font>

83
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then no one'll have to argue.</font>

84
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be making a report 
about Liu-An myself,</font>

85
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I don't think there's any need 
to stop by a base.</font>

86
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you certain?</font>

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to interstellar regulations, 
if Gnosia infection occurs,</font>

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">-we must immediately—
-But no one on this ship is infected.</font>

89
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we don't need 
to follow those regulations.</font>

90
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, this is a surprise!</font>

91
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu, you're more cooperative 
than I thought you'd be.</font>

92
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm. So be it.</font>

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will set course for the Glyze 
star system as Racio requests.</font>

94
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Racio...</font>

95
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need to thank me. I just want 
to hurry up and get back to Glyze.</font>

96
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I get it.</font>

97
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You knew that if we went to a base,</font>

98
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'd find out that I ran away 
unlawfully and capture me.</font>

99
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph. I'm sure everyone here 
thinks this already, but...</font>

100
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remnan, you're rather creepy.</font>

101
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

102
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Jonas...</font>

103
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we're heading to Glyze, could you stop 
by Dr. Yoshikado's place on the way?</font>

104
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But of course. This, too, is fate.</font>

105
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall take you all to 
your desired destinations.</font>

106
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

109
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So the truth I came here to find...</i></font>

110
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri, is something bothering you?</font>

111
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? No, I'm fine. 
I think that's a good idea, too.</font>

112
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,810

116
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,120

134
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It could be an error 
in the detection software,</font>

135
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or something might've snuck on board.</font>

136
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go see.</font>

137
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't notice anything 
when you woke up?</font>

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

139
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, the presence was detected</font>

140
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in the vicinity of the pod 
where you were being treated.</font>

141
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been looping, right?</font>

142
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

143
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. There aren't any 
Gnosia infectees in this world line.</font>

144
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need to lie.</font>

145
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a possibility that something else 
got onto the ship in place of the Gnosia.</font>

146
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

147
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't wake up there.</font>

148
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

149
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't actually wake up 
in the pod during this loop.</font>

150
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then...</font>

151
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure... but...</font>

152
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way.</font>

153
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

154
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's impossible.</font>

155
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Silver Key causes its host's 
consciousness to loop into the past.</font>

156
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it sent its host's body as well,</font>

157
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there'd end up being 
two of the same person.</font>

158
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if that happened, 
the loop would break entirely.</font>

159
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what's the lifeform 
that's being detected in here?</font>

160
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lifeform... is being treated...</font>

161
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it.</font>

162
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then who are you...</font>

163
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, who's the one being 
treated inside this pod?</font>

164
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know,</font>

165
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but...</font>

166
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doubt not,</font>

167
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">fear not,</font>

168
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and know.</font>

169
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowledge will save all.</font>

170
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what you told me long ago.</font>

171
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? I told you?</font>

172
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree, though. We have to know.</font>

173
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like the treatment is complete.</font>

174
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

175
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An extremely unstable world.</font>

176
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

177
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems we were brought here in the wake 
of the universe being destroyed.</font>

178
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It probably won't last long.</font>

179
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The universe was destroyed...?</font>

180
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri...</font>

181
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fear not. Knowledge will save all.</font>

182
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu? Setsu!</font>

183
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... No! No!</font>

184
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be at ease.</font>

185
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing truly exists in this world.</font>

186
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Existence itself is uncertain here.</font>

187
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuriko...</font>

188
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand now?</font>

189
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the truth.</font>

190
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How the hell am I supposed 
to understand?!</font>

191
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

192
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The universe has been destroyed?</font>

193
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cause and effect has collapsed.</font>

194
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of you, something which 
ordinarily could never exist,</font>

195
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the universe has been destroyed.</font>

196
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are the cause of all of this.</font>

197
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me?</font>

198
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Why are you bereft of memories?</font>

199
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because... I have amnesia.</font>

200
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what's the real reason?</font>

201
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't... have any memories 
to begin with.</font>

202
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. You are...</font>

203
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">another Yuri that came into 
existence at that moment.</font>

204
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a fake that was created 
separately from the real Yuri.</font>

205
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. You are a foreign object 
anomalous to this world—</font>

206
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to this universe.</font>

207
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something that absolutely cannot exist.</font>

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a Bug.</font>

209
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong?</font>

210
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu...</font>

211
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, where did you want to go?</font>

212
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where?</font>

213
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who said you 
wanted to go somewhere, Yuri.</font>

214
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

215
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu... Setsu!</font>

216
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu!</font>

217
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Setsu!</font>

218
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yuri...</font>

219
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

220
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

221
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where...</font>

222
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Bug...</font>

223
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you understand now?</font>

224
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a fabricated existence.</font>

225
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a Bug that was created 
separately from the real you.</font>

226
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why...</font>

227
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you run into the real Yuri, 
the universe gets destroyed.</font>

228
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But it never got destroyed before!</font>

229
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been looping over and over, 
and nothing like this has ever happened!</font>

230
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you get it?</font>

231
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It didn't happen for a reason.</font>

232
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is not that you avoided it 
out of mere happenstance.</font>

233
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was no way for it 
to happen to begin with.</font>

234
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Because... there was only one Yuri."</font>

235
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just think about it.</font>

236
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was different this time 
compared to all the others?</font>

237
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be able to figure it out.</font>

238
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There weren't any Gnosia infectees...</font>

239
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Way to go, Yurinchy!</font>

240
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you've gotten that far, 
I'm sure you can figure out the rest!</font>

241
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there aren't any Gnosia infectees...</font>

242
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the humans won't be attacked.</font>

243
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right!</font>

244
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, Yuri.</font>

245
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, I'm exhausted. You can say the rest.</font>

246
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

247
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the world lines where 
Gnosia infectees exist,</font>

248
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the real me that was sleeping here had 
already been eliminated from the start.</font>

249
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Correct.</font>

250
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real Yuri was eliminated 
by a Gnosia infectee.</font>

251
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right after that, you, the Bug, 
appeared within the same pod.</font>

252
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you've been looping 
ever since as a Bug, bud.</font>

253
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But in the world lines where 
there are no Gnosia infectees,</font>

254
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the real Yuri doesn't get attacked.</font>

255
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, having not been eliminated, 
they remain in the pod.</font>

256
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So when you loop and return 
like you just did...</font>

257
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real Yuri and the Bug Yuri...</font>

258
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both of you end up existing at once.</font>

259
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basically, you're a dual existence.</font>

260
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That destroys the law of cause and 
effect, and with it, the universe.</font>

261
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You understand now, don't you?</font>

262
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you arrive at a world line with no 
Gnosia infectees like the previous one,</font>

263
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you will unavoidably encounter the 
other Yuri, destroying the universe.</font>

264
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then...</font>

265
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can only exist in world lines 
where the Gnosia exist.</font>

266
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's... the truth?</font>

267
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

268
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How... did this happen?</font>

269
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me! Why did you do all this?!</font>

270
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you actually believe 
I am capable of that?</font>

271
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one who created you is Gnos.</font>

272
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only one who can willingly 
create a Bug is Gnos.</font>

273
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gnos?</font>

274
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gnos is a collective entity formed 
from the cyberized minds of humanity.</font>

275
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A single consciousness 
that arose out of the chaos.</font>

276
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or so they say.</font>

277
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The shrine maidens of the 
Hoshibune serve Gnos.</font>

278
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The technology of cyberization 
was granted to us by Gnos—</font>

279
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in other words, by God.</font>

280
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">God...?</font>

281
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A collective entity 
possessing all human wisdom.</font>

282
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The supreme will entrusted 
with all decisions.</font>

283
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is the will that created you.</font>

284
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They may be trying to determine something.</font>

285
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A universe where countless individuals 
struggle to communicate with each other,</font>

286
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or a universe ruled by a single 
great will like Gnos...</font>

287
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which one has more value?</font>

288
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I supposed to do...?</font>

289
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows? That is the extent of the 
knowledge that Gnos bestowed upon me.</font>

290
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They disappeared?</font>

291
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

292
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I touched Gnos through that light... 
that was when I knew.</font>

293
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now all that is left 
is to see this through to the end.</font>

294
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Yuri. You're awake already.</font>

295
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Comet...</font>

296
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're all in the cafeteria eating 
right now. Wanna join us?</font>

297
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... I'll go later.</font>

298
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

299
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

300
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

301
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

302
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

303
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N...</font>

304
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>
