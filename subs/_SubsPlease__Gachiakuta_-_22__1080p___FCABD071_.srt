139
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have no more delays.</font>

140
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The trash storm is dying down.</font>

141
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to know...</font>

142
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What made you think an imitation trash 
beast could make it across the border?</font>

143
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People have tried all kinds of ways, 
and nothing's ever crossed it alive.</font>

144
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would that imitation trash beast 
would stand a chance?</font>

145
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Company secret, I guess?</font>

146
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That creature...</font>

147
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">had the power of protection.</font>

148
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This was its core?</i></font>

149
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I forgot! These things fall apart 
when you destroy their cores!</font>

150
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That slipped my mind!</font>

151
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone grab Zanka!</font>

152
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm on it!</font>

153
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grab on to me, everyone!</font>

154
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm nice and plushy, 
so it should dampen the impact!</font>

155
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think...</font>

156
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm relieved and terrified all at once!</font>

157
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great work, everyone!</font>

158
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cleaning complete!</font>

159
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It stinks!</font>

160
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky!</font>

161
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Masks, masks, masks, masks, masks!</font>

162
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. I don't think this is a No Man's Land,</font>

163
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we probably shouldn't hang out 
too long in a polluted zone.</font>

164
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, man.</font>

165
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were just on the way back 
from Penta, remember?</font>

166
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been non-stop since then, you know?</font>

167
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even stinky trash is like a nice bed to me now.</font>

168
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Penta...</font>

169
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I never got to find out what happened to Amo.</i></font>

170
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What was it...</i></font>

171
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name</font>

172
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is Zodyl Typhon.</font>

173
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to take down the Sphere with me?</font>

174
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He gave me that invitation, then...</i></font>

175
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me...</font>

176
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't be satisfied with things 
as they are now, can you?</font>

177
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want more than this facsimile 
of friendship, don't you?</font>

178
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He said that, and then...</i></font>

179
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This has all been an experiment.</font>

180
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to ride this 
trash beast across the border.</font>

181
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He dragged us into his crazy experiment 
on that huge trash beast,</i></font>

182
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and what I got was...</i></font>

183
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Watchman Series.</font>

184
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm tired.</font>

185
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna eat something sweet.</font>

186
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sweets...</font>

187
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were...</font>

188
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so worried!</font>

189
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No... pressure.</i></font>

190
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is everyone all right?</font>

191
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anybody need first aid?</font>

192
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyone badly injured?</font>

193
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zanka. Zanka got the worst of it.</font>

194
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Riyo, too.</font>

195
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be fine. Look after Zanka first.</font>

196
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad you're safe.</font>

197
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big Brother.</font>

198
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big Brother?</font>
