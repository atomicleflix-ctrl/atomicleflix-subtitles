00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're safe now.</font>

2
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dear me.</font>

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it isn't Aldous Clayton.</font>

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, from the Mayflower Company.</font>

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! <i>That</i> Aldous?!</font>

6
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would've let you be
if you were none the wiser.</font>

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, you look about 
as foolish as they come.</font>

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How right you are! 
What a complete fool I am.</i></font>

9
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are we?</font>

10
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Folkvangr, the House of Plenty,
on Rosenkreuz street.</font>

11
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What love I'll make to you, my pet.</font>

12
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Isn't this...</i></font>

13
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Oh, you. Not just yet.</font>

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>...the infamous high-class brothel?!</i></font>

15
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-Is he going to sell me?!</font>

16
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she realized your identity, and you 
were so shocked that you brought her here?</font>

17
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know how to make 
a darling little blunder, Rudy!</font>

18
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"R-Rudy"?</font>

19
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abigail, um...</font>

20
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abby's the mistress of the house.</font>

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right, Rebekah?</font>

22
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's the <i>owner</i>. 
You're such an idiot, Miriam.</font>

23
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

24
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I'm the mistress here, then I suppose 
that makes Rudy my guard dog.</font>

25
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, and the Mayflower Company
 where Aldous works belongs to Abby too!</font>

26
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm an investor there,
 to be precise.</font>

27
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, what about that man? 
Did you kill him?</font>

28
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shot him in the leg, 
and it didn't so much as faze him.</font>

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a trained soldier, 
not just any dealer.</font>

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a dealer?</font>

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. He was selling 
some nasty drugs around here.</font>

32
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would a man like that want with me?</font>

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I'd like to know.</font>

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Was it something I did?</i></font>

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He recognized Lady Lily's spell, too...</i></font>

36
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, wait!</font>

37
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We cannot allow you beyond this point!</font>

38
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Lordship!</font>

39
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

40
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard that my Constance Grail
 was in your company.</font>

41
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gracious. <i>Your</i> Constance?</font>

42
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An abandoned carriage, 
a corpse with gunshot wounds...</font>

43
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can see why I feared the worst.</font>

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry.</font>

45
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You needn't apologize. I doubt there 
was anything you could have done.</font>

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, in future,</font>

47
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would appreciate it if you informed me 
before taking any initiative.</font>

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will.</font>

49
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett?</font>

50
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong? Are you all right?</font>

51
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just sleepy.</font>

52
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose this is what I get
 for using that power.</font>

53
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to rest awhile...</font>

54
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Randolph.</font>

55
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse him. He's a colleague of mine.</font>

56
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyle.</font>

57
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've come to tell you 
we'll be working late again.</font>

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's about the body of 
the coachman who was shot.</font>

59
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He had a sun tattoo 
on the nape of his neck.</font>

60
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A sun tattoo?</font>

61
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know something?</font>

62
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes. I'm sure I've seen one before.</font>

63
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was, um...</font>

64
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was on her!</font>

65
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The woman who collapsed 
at the masquerade ball!</font>

66
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kiara Grafton!</font>

67
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Kiara?</font>

68
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gaina didn't mention that in his report.
 Damn that bungler!</font>

69
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">E-Excuse me, but I think Scarlett...</font>

70
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, this takes me back. That's Jane.</font>

71
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...called her "Jane."</font>

72
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did she have a sweet smell about her?</font>

73
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes, I believe she did.</font>

74
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Jackal's Paradise.</font>

75
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A potent hallucinogen.</font>

76
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was known as "Jane" in certain circles.</font>

77
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hallucinogen?</font>

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aldous said that the coachman 
who attacked me was a drug dealer.</font>

79
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he had a sun tattoo 
as well, didn't he?</font>

80
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are these people?</font>

81
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A vast criminal syndicate 
we've been pursuing for a long time.</font>

82
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Murder, kidnapping, human trafficking, 
hallucinogen smuggling...</font>

83
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's said they belong to no nation 
and will do anything for the right price.</font>

84
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The syndicate's name is Daeg Gallus.</font>

85
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It means "the rooster that crows at dawn."</font>

86
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jane?</font>

87
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it wasn't illegal ten years ago.</font>

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though I can't say it ever agreed with me.</font>

89
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>At least she's back 
to her usual self after a nap.</i></font>

90
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss!</font>

91
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Kate Lorraine has come calling.</font>

92
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate...</font>

93
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A messenger from the Grail house 
came to us last night,</font>

94
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">saying that you hadn't come home 
and asking if we knew anything.</font>

95
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me, Connie...</font>

96
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What on earth 
have you gotten yourself into?</font>

97
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it dangerous?</font>

98
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If so, then just give it up!</font>

99
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't tell her! It's deadly dangerous, 
but Kate's the last person I could tell!</i></font>

100
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why won't you say anything?</font>

101
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a word about your engagement, 
and now not a word about this!</font>

102
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, tell me why...</font>

103
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Kate.</font>

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that's all you came to say,</font>

105
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then... go home.</font>

106
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Think of the risk!</font>

107
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even so!</font>

108
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate...?</font>

113
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that big thing?</font>

114
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got you a souvenir, Shoshanna.</font>

117
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look after him for me.</font>

118
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate Lorraine, right?</font>

119
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me. Where's Lily Orlamunde's key?</font>

120
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't play dumb. 
I know Constance Grail had it.</font>

121
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that's it. He's after Connie!</i></font>

122
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

123
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never heard of any such thing.</font>

124
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I wouldn't tell you even if I had.</font>

125
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You little...!</font>

126
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Ugh, how revolting.</font>

127
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Salvador?</font>

128
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me, José. Your job
 is to sell Paradise, right?</font>

129
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So who said you could pull this stunt?</font>

130
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Looking for the key's
 part of our job too!</font>

131
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My partner was following a lead
on it and got bumped off!</font>

132
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,570

133
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And?</font>

134
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway...</font>

135
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Consider yourself warned.</font>

137
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you resent Constance Grail?</font>

138
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not one bit.</font>

139
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meeting her was 
the best fortune I've ever had,</font>

140
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I've never been prouder of anything 
than I am of being her friend.</font>

141
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Resent her? You must be joking.</font>

142
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh yeah?</font>

143
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not coming, Mommy?</font>

144
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}11 YEARS AGO, WINTER</font>

145
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, dear. 
I know it's your first real party.</font>

146
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To make it up to you... Here.</font>

147
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Special occasion cookies!</font>

148
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make lots of friends, okay?</font>

149
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

150
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Pamela Francis.</font>

151
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you ever so much 
for inviting me toda—</font>

152
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You stink!</font>

153
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stink to high heaven.</font>

154
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, what a horrible smell.</font>

155
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Maybe you smell the commoner on her?</font>

156
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh dear.</font>

157
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}She does reek.</font>

158
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, isn't her mother...</font>

159
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You there. You think so too, don't you?</font>

160
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't that girl smell just awful?</font>

161
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She doesn't smell bad at all.</font>

162
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, she smells like...</font>

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know! Cookies!</font>

164
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Pamela!</font>

165
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please wait for us!</font>

166
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want one?</font>

167
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I?</font>

168
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Delicious!</font>

169
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'm Kate. Kate Lorraine.</font>

170
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Connie!</font>

171
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate...</font>

172
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

173
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't just sit here and do nothing.</font>

174
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My.</font>

175
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And here I thought you'd do as you're told
 like a naive little simpleton again.</font>

176
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Grail.</font>

177
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Lordship.</font>

178
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look pale. Is something the matter?</font>

179
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What brings you here?</font>

180
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to put something to Scarlett.</font>

181
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was anyone else at that ball 
using Jackal's Paradise?</font>

182
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

183
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Don't breathe a word to anyone."</font>

184
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

185
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Nothing.</font>

186
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to tell His Lordship, 
but if I do, what about Kate?</i></font>

187
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Norman Holden.</font>

188
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he was there too, 
and he had quite the Jane habit.</font>

189
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She, uh, says that 
there was a Norman Holden.</font>

190
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's certain?</font>

191
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

192
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I'll look into him, then.</font>

193
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In the end,</i></font>

194
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I got her involved in 
the worst way possible.</i></font>

195
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm certain our friendship 
will never be the same.</i></font>

196
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But even so...</i></font>

197
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop right there.</font>

198
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate!</font>

199
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you come, you dunderhead?!</font>

200
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why? It's my fault you—</font>

201
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't <i>want</i> to be saved
 if it comes at your expense!</font>

202
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly...
You never think things through.</font>

203
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not cross with me?</font>

204
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came alone like you asked,
 so let Kate go!</font>

205
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take her away.</font>

206
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure you finish the job.</font>

207
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What are you...</font>

208
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't have her talking, obviously.</font>

209
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And dead girls tell no tales.</font>

210
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait...</font>

211
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Constance Grail!</font>

213
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Follow your own path.</font>

214
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate?</font>

215
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hey! Get a move on!</font>

216
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

217
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't what you promised!</font>

218
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, little lady,</font>

219
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it's your own fault
 for falling for it.</font>

220
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Let go of me!</font>

221
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate! Kate!</font>

222
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Pipe down!</font>

223
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Quit struggling!</font>

224
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop that man!</font>

225
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll tell you everything! 
I'll do anything!</font>

226
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other girl kept a cooler head.</font>

227
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was prepared for the worst all along.</font>

228
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... Kate!</font>

229
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ka—</font>

230
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

231
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then...</font>

232
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't move.</font>

233
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Lordship...?</font>

234
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way! The Security Force?</font>

235
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

236
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I regret to inform you we've already 
arrested your friends in the back.</font>

237
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then Kate must be...!</i></font>

238
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it! You tricked me!</font>

239
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, do forgive us.</font>

240
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's your own fault 
for falling for it!</font>

241
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Earl Norman Holden
 passed away 13 years ago.</font>

242
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He couldn't have attended that ball.</font>

243
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was an old coot whose hobby was 
preaching the goddesses' word at people.</font>

244
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One day, someone flew 
into a rage over it and killed him.</font>

245
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His last words were...</font>

246
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"O gods, save me!"</font>

247
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you gave me his name
to send His Lordship a message?</font>

248
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Scarlett.</font>

249
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Moreover, as I've already told you, 
you're hopeless at lying.</font>

250
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

251
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you apologizing for?</font>

252
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For, um, worrying you, I suppose.</font>

253
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, you weren't worried 
about me at all, I'm sure!</font>

254
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, you were merely doing your job.</font>

255
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How silly of me! I just got 
carried away and wasn't thinking!</font>

256
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

257
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was worried, was I?</font>

258
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Does he mean...</i></font>

259
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe it!</font>

260
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This emotionless, stick-in-the-mud
 blockhead actually...</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crown Princess Cecilia... has the blood 
of a prostitute in her veins.</font>

274
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unbelievable, right?</font>

275
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her family, the Luzes, are a proper line
 of blue-blooded viscounts, after all.</font>

276
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I got a tip that their family register
 shows signs of tampering.</font>

277
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Viscount Luze had a daughter
 with his wife, it's true.</font>

278
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, apparently, the girl died 
in an epidemic quite some time ago.</font>

279
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet <i>she</i> was the one 
with the weak constitution.</font>

280
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Turns out the viscount
 had another daughter.</font>

281
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although her rose-red eyes 
proved she was of Luze blood,</font>

282
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he'd given her to an orphanage 
because her mother was only his mistress.</font>

283
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say this girl and a boy at 
the same orphanage swore eternal love.</font>

284
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her name was... Oh, right. Cici.</font>

285
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The crown princess often slips out of the 
palace to visit the people of the slums.</font>

286
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's famously proof of her virtue...</font>

287
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what if she's really been 
rendezvousing with her old lover?</font>

288
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too bad my source went 
and turned into a drug addict on me!</font>

289
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember Teresa Jennings, 
who killed herself?</font>

290
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her husband.</font>

291
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Drugs...?</font>

292
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, now I need a new helper 
who can get close to the crown princess!</font>

293
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm counting on you, 
my sincere Miss Grail.</font>

294
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait just a—</font>

295
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett, did you know?</font>

296
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's news to me.</font>

297
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Connie?</font>

298
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kate!</font>

299
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness! Oh, thank goodness!</font>

300
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I made it out, didn't I?</font>

301
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry, Kate. 
You must have been terrified.</font>

302
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so, so very...</font>

303
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Connie.</font>

304
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Kate.</font>

305
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something I want you to hear.</font>

306
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kiriki kirikuku.</font>

307
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lie low and stay calm.</font>

308
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my lucky day.</font>

309
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up and untie me.</font>

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hi there, Cess.</font>

311
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or, given where we are, should I say...</font>

312
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crown Princess Cecilia?</font>

313
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Out of my sight, merchant. You're barred.</font>

314
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have a heart! You banned me 
from the palace yourself.</font>

315
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, about the abortion drug...</font>

316
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who was it who assured me 
its odor was too faint to detect?</font>

317
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that was me.</font>

318
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, why not take the chance 
to bear the prince's child?</font>

319
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The higher-ups have been pestering you 
to have a kid, haven't they?</font>

320
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would be harder to get 
anything done while carrying.</font>

321
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think I ordered that medicine?</font>

322
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, no skin off my nose.</font>

323
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate using kids as much as you do.</font>

324
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, why are you here?</font>

325
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a message from headquarters.</font>

326
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,540
