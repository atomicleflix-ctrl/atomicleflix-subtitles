2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all still here?</font>

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bernd?</font>

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where have you been?</font>

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was inside the mansion.</font>

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured if it was all gonna burn anyway,
 I'd grab some of it as severance pay.</font>

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But don't worry.
I'll split it with the rest of you.</font>

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'll be on my way.</font>

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Elise, I'll be in touch!</font>

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mistress.</font>

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you intend to do now?</font>

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid you got to see 
the absolute worst of all of us last night.</font>

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure it left 
a very unpleasant impression.</font>

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, we still do view you as family.</font>

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes'm, indeedy. 
You're like a baby sister to us.</font>

18
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why don't we all stay together?</font>

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've all supported me 
through everything up until now.</font>

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I think this is a good time
 for me to leave the nest.</font>

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise to come see you.</font>

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I want to be able to stand 
proudly on my own two feet.</font>

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will meet again.</font>

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne.</font>

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it true I was never human to begin with?</font>

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I never expected the mistress
to have already been bled.</i></font>

29
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It appears she was already not human.</i></font>

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must mean... 
From the very beginning...</font>

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-L-Lord Arne?</font>

32
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't carrying my blood after all.</font>

33
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Huh?</font>

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look in the mirror.</font>

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! I have a reflection!</font>

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did it take you this long to realize?</font>

37
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, whenever I drink your blood,
 it revitalizes me.</font>

38
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Blood from animals and 
other species doesn't do that.</font>

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, you are definitely human.
 Both then and now.</font>

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, why...</font>

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand it either. 
But does it really matter that much?</font>

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

43
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whether you're human or something else,</font>

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you're still Lynn Reinweiß, correct?</font>

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As surely as you are Lord Arne.</font>

46
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I believe I have fulfilled 
my contract with you, human.</font>

48
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,060

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After that, we became inseparable.</i></font>

138
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We had both been all alone before.</i></font>

139
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You were alone?</i></font>

140
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd gotten separated from my pod.</i></font>

141
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't really know what Hanna's deal was,</i></font>

142
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but she said she could never go home again.</i></font>

143
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ouch.</font>

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Every day with her was so much fun.</i></font>

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We were only together 
for a short while, though.</i></font>

146
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it lovely?</font>

147
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like a real summer romance!</font>

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why did Hanna attack her?</font>

149
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No deductive reasoning necessary.</font>

150
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The woman was probably after 
the mermaid's flesh and blood.</font>

151
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flesh and blood?</font>

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, her flesh and her blood.</font>

153
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When humans eat mermaid flesh,
 they become immortal.</font>

154
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of that, 
many humans hunt mermaids.</font>

155
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But not her. Hanna was different!</font>

156
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, she swore eternal love to me.</font>

157
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eternal? Even though 
human life is so short?</font>

158
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe she was just promising to love her
and stay with her until the day she died!</font>

159
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, then perhaps she decided 
to kill her out of love?</font>

160
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill her...</font>

161
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and make Yurate hers forevermore?</font>

162
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand what you mean!</font>

163
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's probably something like that.</font>

164
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:19,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe she wanted to stuff and mount 
the dead mermaid to keep her forever.</font>

165
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your reasoning is too sloppy!</font>

166
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she'd meant to kill her from the start, 
she'd already had plenty of chances.</font>

167
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True. And even if it was
 just for a short time,</font>

168
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there was probably no need 
to start living together.</font>

169
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take the job.</font>

170
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll kill some time, at the very least.</font>

171
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That night, I was sleeping 
in the shack like always.</font>

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna?</font>

173
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

174
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yura...</font>

175
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What? Why?!</font>

176
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please understand, Yura.</font>

177
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Stop!</font>

178
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna! Please!</font>

179
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop!</font>

180
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna?</font>

181
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna! Hanna!</font>

182
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was she going to use the syringe to drain 
her blood and the knife to carve her up?</font>

183
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was there anything unusual about 
the woman before she attacked you?</font>

184
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that you mention it, she'd seemed 
to be researching something recently.</font>

185
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you looking at?</font>

186
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

187
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A nautical chart?</font>

188
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Yura. Are you sure
you're the only mermaid left?</font>

189
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

190
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you have friends?</font>

191
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you know where
 to find other mermaids?</font>

192
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I don't.</font>

193
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

194
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After that, Hanna stopped talking to me.</i></font>

195
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must have been 
searching for mermaids.</font>

196
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps she was planning to build
 a harem of mermaids. Dirty girl.</font>

197
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More like eat 'em all alive.</font>

198
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... So Hanna really did mean to do it?</font>

199
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you feeling okay?</font>

200
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry.</font>

201
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm glad I at least 
threw up in the tank.</font>

202
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, y-you are?</font>

203
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'll help you clean it later.</font>

204
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you. You're very kind.</font>

205
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really shouldn't be doing this.</font>

206
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I keep saying I want to 
understand her reasons, but...</font>

207
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why shouldn't you?</font>

208
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had been alone for a long time.</font>

209
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd gotten separated from my pod
 a very long time before.</font>

210
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I was so lonely.</font>

211
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But then, Hanna made me a promise.</font>

212
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong, Yura?</font>

213
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know. I just feel so happy.</font>

214
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never knew my heart 
could feel this full.</font>

215
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't help but laugh.</font>

216
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I know that's because I'm with you.</font>

217
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna?</font>

218
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get married, Yura.</font>

219
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

220
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I, Hanna, hereby swear to love you
 for all eternity, Yurate.</font>

221
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All eternity?</font>

222
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, all eternity. As in forever.</font>

223
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forever?</font>

224
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Forever" it is.</font>

225
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I lied. I don't want to know why.</font>

226
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yurate?</font>

227
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The truth is, I probably just want
 to hear someone tell me</font>

228
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that Hanna wasn't actually
 trying to kill me.</font>

229
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why did this happen?</font>

230
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to know, but I'm also scared.</font>

231
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's best if I never find out.</font>

232
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that isn't right.</font>

233
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You cared about her that much, 
but you'd rather not know what happened?</font>

234
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe that at all.</font>

235
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it's scary, but knowing what 
happened should bring you peace,</font>

236
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and help you find a way to move on.</font>

237
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to believe Hanna 
was sincere in her promise.</font>

238
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if she swore eternal love,</font>

239
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">compared to an immortal mermaid,</font>

240
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a human life would pass by
 in the blink of an eye.</font>

241
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure it must be terrible to die first,
 leaving your loved one behind.</font>

242
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mermaids aren't immortal.</font>

243
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

244
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They certainly live much longer 
than humans, but they're mortal.</font>

245
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? But I was sure...</font>

246
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring her in here, Lynn Reinweiß.</font>

247
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My original hypothesis still stands.</font>

248
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The woman assaulted the mermaid 
because she wanted to become immortal.</font>

249
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you said there was no point in living 
together if she just wanted to kill her.</font>

250
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was a point. 
That was the woman's ultimate goal.</font>

251
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goal?</font>

252
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The woman wanted to continue 
living with the mermaid,</font>

253
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so she tried to eat her.</font>

254
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

255
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that would defeat the purpose.</font>

256
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, sure would. Unless...</font>

257
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What if that woman believed
mermaids were immortal, too?</font>

258
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's 200 years old,
 but just look at her.</font>

259
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wouldn't be unusual for a human
 to assume she's immortal.</font>

260
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you agree?</font>

261
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

262
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the syringe the woman 
used during the crime</font>

263
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">likely wasn't meant 
for draining her blood.</font>

264
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only someone like you, Lynn Reinweiß, 
would jump to a conclusion like that.</font>

265
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are many other possibilities.</font>

266
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking a blood sample, poisoning her,
 giving her an anesthetic...</font>

267
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe she wanted to make the procedure 
as painless as possible for the mermaid.</font>

268
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was gonna eat her, after all.</font>

269
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would she bother doing that?</font>

270
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to ask one thing first.</font>

271
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much time did you 
spend with the woman?</font>

272
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know. I wasn't counting.</font>

273
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe half of a hundred years?
 Or a little more?</font>

274
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A <i>hundred</i>? But you said 
you were only together a short while.</font>

275
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That isn't very long.</font>

276
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Different species 
experience time differently.</font>

277
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the mermaid's eyes, the woman likely
looked the same as when they met.</font>

278
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, time had surely taken its toll.</font>

279
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nearing the end of her life,</font>

280
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the woman was probably afraid of dying 
and leaving the mermaid behind.</font>

281
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she died, the mermaid 
would be alone again.</font>

282
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So she decided to use the mermaid's flesh
 to become immortal</font>

283
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and continue living together,</font>

284
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">thereby fulfilling her promise
 of eternal love.</font>

285
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But...</font>

286
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"It must be terrible to die first, 
leaving your loved one behind."</font>

287
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those were your words.</font>

288
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna.</font>

289
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a relief.</font>

290
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

291
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love can take many forms. 
Isn't that what makes it wonderful?</font>

292
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes, I have trouble 
understanding the way people think.</font>

293
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, those two will never—</font>

294
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-huh?</font>

295
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so cute when you're sad, Lynn.</font>

296
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does <i>that</i> have to do 
with what I was just saying?</font>

297
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One sip of mermaid blood.</font>

298
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How silly.</font>

299
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,410
