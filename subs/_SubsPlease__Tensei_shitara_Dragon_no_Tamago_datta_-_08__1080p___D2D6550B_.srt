63
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We searched all through the village
and there's no sign of Myria.</font>

64
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I knew it!</font>

66

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just to make sure, will you
go looking around the village again?</font>

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's a chance Myria
will come back here.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Like that cave
with a jar full of Piperis we found.</font>

78
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">On top of that,
you mentioned seeing a Plague Dragon?</font>

79
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Either way,</font>

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">we concluded that it was too risky for the
two of us to continue investigating alone,</font>

81
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and that's why we called for you.</font>

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Are we going to start searching now?</font>

83
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, we're headed to the village first.</font>

84
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll meet with the client</font>

85
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and get permission to proceed
with our full roster.</font>

86
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Let's go.</font>

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Damn it, they're so persistent!</font>

88
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And there's a lot more than before!</font>

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right!
I won't get surrounded over here!</font>

90
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can protect Myria!</font>

91
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come and get me, jerks!</font>

92
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Time to meet your maker!</font>

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Kinda weird
how they never tried to retreat.</font>

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why is that?</font>

95
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Because you have maxed out your level,
you cannot gain experience points.</font>

96
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I know that.</font>

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Myria?</font>

98
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So, what should I do?</font>

99
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is it okay for me to bring Myria
to the village like this?</font>

100
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But I think the same thing
will happen again.</font>

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Help!</font>

102
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, I'm just-</font>

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,960

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm trying to help her!</font>

105
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What was Myria doing alone
in the forest to begin with?</font>

106
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's no way that she doesn't know
how dangerous it is.</font>

107
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Man...</font>

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'd understand everything
if I could just ask her directly.</font>

109
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Damn this language barrier!</font>

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, I guess I'll take her
to a safe place near the village for now.</font>

111
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, I kinda understood her that time.</font>

112
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I feel it.</font>

113
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I think she said "thank you"!</font>

114
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Would you like to view the evolution tree?</font>

115
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There you go again, putting a damper
on the feel-good moments!</font>

116

117
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll give it a gander.</font>

140
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,040

in speed over strength.</font>

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It is the speedster of the dragon world.</font>

142
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, obviously just uses
the "Roll" skill.</font>

143
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I mean, it's in the name!</font>

144
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Little Arc Dragon.</font>

145
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A light-type dragon.</font>

146
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It has high intelligence,
and makes use of white magic.</font>

can evolve into something so righteous!</font>

less evolution options later,</font>

150
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but I like the sound of white magic!</font>

152
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It has the body of a huge snake,</font>

153
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and its entire body is covered
with scales that contain a deadly poison.</font>

will become barren.</font>

155
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, hell no!</font>

156
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That'd make me
the number one enemy of humankind!</font>

157
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'd be dooming myself!</font>

158
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Jormungand is completely
out of the question, obviously.</font>

159
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I am interested in the Roll specialization

197
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is it because my skill leveled up?!</font>

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That didn't work.</font>

understand what she's saying,</font>

207
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,710

223
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well then, what should I call you?</font>

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've never thought about it.</font>

225
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,330

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,380

276
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They're real heavy.</font>

281
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll take a detour

312
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Why, though?
What does he want with the village?</font>

316
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It might be a Rock Dragon egg.</font>

317
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And if he brings it into the village...</font>

322
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is he leading it
to the village on purpose?</font>

323
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is this part of some revenge plan?</font>

324
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">And why is he riding
on the back of those monsters?</font>

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ah, my thoughts are all over the place!</font>
