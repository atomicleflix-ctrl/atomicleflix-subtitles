00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hmm, how interesting.</i></font>

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello.</font>

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you an applicant, too?</font>

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Hello.</font>

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you the saint of the Holy Kingdom?</font>

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what if I am?</font>

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you really are. Amazing!</font>

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a light attribute, right? 
I've never met one before!</font>

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you behave so familiarly.</font>

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the only attribute that 
allows you to heal, isn't it?</font>

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredible! I have so many questions!</font>

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're trying to hit on me, 
the answer is no.</font>

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please! Pretty please!</font>

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe over some sweets?</font>

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's quite a character.</font>

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

17
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THE ADVANCED CLASS</font>

18
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, I'm begging you!</font>

19
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to hear about light magic.</font>

20
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what do you plan
 to do after that?</font>

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Light stands higher than the 
magic of other attributes.</font>

22
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can inferior magic learn 
from superior magic?</font>

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

24
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no clear hierarchy in magic.</font>

25
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not aware of this myself,</font>

26
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I lack emotions 
compared to other people.</font>

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I'm speaking normally, 
but you may feel offended.</font>

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to let you know
that in advance.</font>

29
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your emotions?</font>

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a Hero's Scar.</font>

31
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hero's Scar?!</font>

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Like me, she carries the 
Curse of the Demon Lord.</i></font>

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The saint with light magic, 
and a Hero's Scar on top of that!</font>

34
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which makes you even more fascinating!</font>

35
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, I want to hear more!</font>

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because it's fate that we met here today!</font>

37
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no idea what you're talking about.</font>

38
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Save your flirting for later.</font>

39
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor Soff.</font>

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to make you wait.</font>

41
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So strong.</i></font>

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this everyone, Ms. Sayfie?</font>

43
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Soff Cricket.</font>

45
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am a professor here at 
the Dirashik School of Magic.</font>

46
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my assistant, Ms. Sayfie.</font>

47
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Sayfie.</font>

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not an official employee,
 but I'm like an associate professor.</font>

49
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now...</font>

50
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All four of you, congratulations 
on your enrollment.</font>

51
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We passed?</font>

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what about the exam?</font>

53
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this school, you can basically 
pass if you're a sorcerer.</font>

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I heard.</font>

55
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We never announce that to the public.</font>

56
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorcerers with crests 
are rare and precious.</font>

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would we leave you alone?</font>

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I studied so much for the exam.</font>

59
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course you'll take the exam.</font>

60
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why we asked you four to be here.</font>

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are three courses at 
the Dirashik School of Magic.</font>

62
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The First Level, 
also known as Fundamentals.</font>

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a class to learn the basics 
of magic, as the name suggests.</font>

64
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Second Level is 
called Teacher-Assisted,</font>

65
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it's closer to how a class 
is taught in a normal school.</font>

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This class has the most students.</font>

67
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the advanced Third Level class
 is also called Independent Research.</font>

68
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're usually not in their classroom.</font>

69
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They can choose what they want to do,</font>

70
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what to learn, and study 
it wherever they like.</font>

71
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can choose to improve your 
magic skills or devise new spells.</font>

72
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or write grimoires or 
invent new magic tools.</font>

73
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The advanced class. I get to research 
what I want? That's perfect!</i></font>

74
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the advanced class is for 
fostering the top-tier sorcerers.</font>

75
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting into it and 
graduating won't be easy.</font>

76
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You four came with letters 
of recommendation,</font>

77
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from your country or 
your masters of magic.</font>

78
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They think you have enough skill 
to be in the advanced class.</font>

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The exam for the advanced class?</font>

80
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what do you think we'll be tested on?</font>

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm kind of excited, you know?</font>

82
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tch.</font>

83
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First is the practical skill test. Ready?</font>

84
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

85
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

86
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

87
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

88
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One by one, step forward and tell 
me your crest's attribute, its rank,</font>

89
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the number of spells you can use.</font>

90
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hank Beat.</font>

91
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

92
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Hank Beat.</font>

93
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a two-star fire crest.</font>

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can use seven spells.</font>

95
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show me your best spell.</font>

96
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ka-ryu.</font>

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow.</font>

99
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ka-ryu.</i></font>

100
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Flame goes up along the magical 
power that precedes it.</i></font>

101
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's an elementary spell 
that's not too difficult.</i></font>

102
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The magical power to determine</i></font>

103
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the route seems more important 
than the flame itself.</i></font>

104
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The structure is simple, so its 
applications are limitless.</i></font>

105
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Very informative.</i></font>

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, not bad.</font>

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your control is especially excellent.</font>

108
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next.</font>

109
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

110
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Riyah Houghs.</font>

111
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My attribute is wind, and I'm a two-star.</font>

112
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have eight spells I can use.</font>

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eight at your age?</font>

114
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's incredible.</font>

115
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a wind crest, too.</font>

116
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes me want to root for you.</font>

117
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you very much.</font>

118
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, excuse me, but please 
keep your distance.</font>

119
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

120
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's so big.</i></font>

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fu-garu.</font>

122
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An intermediate spell.</font>

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is something.</font>

124
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Fu-garu draws the magical power in the sky</i></font>

125
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to collect air and turns 
it into wind to release it.</i></font>

126
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It seems the intermediate magic 
uses way more magical power.</i></font>

127
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, not that I actually see it.</i></font>

128
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Quite different from the elementary 
magic. Very interesting.</i></font>

129
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Reyes Saint-Lance.</font>

130
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My attribute is three-star light.</font>

131
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can use five spells.</font>

132
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,140

133
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And three stars. Even more fascinating!</i></font>

134
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My best spell is healing magic,
 but no one is injured right now, so...</font>

135
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,500

136
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,190

137
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You can't evade this unless 
you react before she casts it!</i></font>

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't contain my curiosity!</i></font>

139
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, lastly, Kunon Gurion.</font>

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

141
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Kunon Gurion, a two-star of water.</font>

142
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have two spells I can use.</font>

143
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two?</font>

144
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, two!</font>

145
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Elementary A-ori and A-rubu.</font>

146
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only two elementary spells.</font>

147
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite that, I've been told 
to make your exam extra hard.</font>

148
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

149
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have two letters of 
recommendation under your name.</font>

150
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One is from the Grand Master of 
the Royal Sorcerers of Hughlia,</font>

151
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Londimonde.</font>

152
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grand Master Blue Cheese?</font>

153
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, who?</font>

154
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And another letter,</font>

155
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the request to make your exam 
challenging, came from your master.</font>

156
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My master?</font>

157
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Zeonly Finroll.</font>

158
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The</i> Zeonly Finroll?</font>

159
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the student of the 
best-selling sorcerer?</font>

160
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tch.</font>

161
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know my master?</font>

162
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every sorcerer in education knows him.</font>

163
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And according to him...</font>

164
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll complete any assignment 
you give, so make it extra hard.</font>

165
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll show you what my 
student is capable of.</font>

166
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watch and be amazed, you fools.</font>

167
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what he said.</font>

168
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, so that's what he's like.</i></font>

169
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

170
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If my master insists, then so be it.</font>

171
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll do it? Okay, then.</font>

172
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see your impudence comes from that man.</font>

173
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're so audacious.</font>

174
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate your pretentious calmness 
and how flirty you are.</font>

175
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should keep that to yourself.</font>

176
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who cares?</font>

177
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The boy is supposed the masterpiece of 
that man who rarely acknowledges anyone.</font>

178
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's give him the toughest 
exam and send him back home.</font>

179
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor Sayfie, do you 
have history with my master?</font>

180
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not.</font>

181
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would I?!</font>

182
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you do...</font>

183
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well then, let's begin Kunon 
Gurion's practical skill test.</font>

184
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity.</font>

185
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I'll give it my all, 
so will you watch me?</font>

186
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And maybe we can go somewhere 
together afterwards?</font>

187
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough. No flirting, okay?</font>

188
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fu-ruguru.</font>

189
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try and hit me with your magic.</font>

190
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fu-ruguru.</font>

191
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An intermediate spell that creates 
a wall of wind around the caster.</font>

192
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amazing! It's a whirlpool 
of magical power.</font>

193
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Water will be repelled easily.</font>

194
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Touch carelessly, and you'll 
be shredded to pieces.</font>

195
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Strong wind will shut out water.</i></font>

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Those with no attack magic can't 
possibly break through this.</i></font>

197
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I'm on my guard.</i></font>

198
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even a fairly skilled sorcerer would 
find this assignment difficult.</i></font>

199
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not to mention you only 
have two elementary spells.</i></font>

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Now, what would you do?</i></font>

201
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? That's all?</font>

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

203
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought it'd be more challenging.</font>

204
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? You sound unsatisfied, but let's 
see you complete the assignment first.</font>

205
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girls won't like you if you're 
all talk and no action.</font>

206
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I can't have that.</font>

207
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, here I go.</font>

208
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

209
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A-ori? He sure produced
a lot of them, but still...</i></font>

210
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey now, you won't be able to break 
through my Fu-ruguru with that.</font>

211
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply.</font>

212
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply.</font>

213
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply.</font>

214
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply.</font>

215
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply.</font>

216
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply.</font>

217
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Color!</font>

218
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Red mist.</font>

219
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's surrounded me.</i></font>

220
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So I have nowhere to run. But...</i></font>

221
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So? Is that all?</font>

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-ori.</font>

223
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? It is over, isn't it?</font>

224
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can keep this up for at least two days.</font>

225
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what about you?</font>

226
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long can you sustain a spell 
that requires so much magical power?</font>

227
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't last for half a day, will you?</font>

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was no rule about time limit,</font>

229
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so this assignment is over.</font>

230
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's the strength of the elementary magic.</i></font>

231
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He made this assignment 
into a test of endurance,</i></font>

232
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and I'm quite at a disadvantage.</i></font>

233
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I use less magical power, 
the red mist will overwhelm me.</i></font>

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Compared to intermediate magic, 
elementary magic is easy to sustain.</i></font>

235
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And most likely he has...</i></font>

236
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. You win.</font>

237
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

238
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Who knew he'd beat me so easily?</i></font>

239
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Zeon has sent me a child 
with frightening potential.</i></font>

240
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you see that? Did you?</font>

241
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to try shooting super-fast 
water like your light beam.</font>

242
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me how you do it! Please!</font>

243
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor Soff, it's almost 
time for the interview.</font>

244
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, my gosh! A sea of blood?!</font>

245
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oops.</font>

246
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to combine your light 
magic and my water magic.</font>

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's try it!</font>

248
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not interested.</font>

249
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I am.</font>

250
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know! I'll buy you a Dirashik 
specialty, a magic parfait.</font>

251
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You there, stop flirting.</font>

252
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now you'll have an individual interview.</font>

253
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any questions?</font>

254
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

255
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The saint totally shuts me down.</font>

256
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please give her a warning!</font>

257
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard many questions in my life, 
but that "question" is definitely a first.</font>

258
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should send him back home.</font>

259
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now, Ms. Sayfie.</font>

260
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyhow, no more flirting 
until the exam is over.</font>

261
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not disturb others' peace of mind,
because this is a critical moment.</font>

262
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

263
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

264
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Ladies' hearts race faster 
when an attractive gentleman hits on them.</font>

265
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It throws you off balance, doesn't it?</font>

266
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will begin the interview!</font>

267
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hank Beat, follow me.</font>

268
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, ma'am.</font>

269
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor, who will interview 
me and about what?</font>

270
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll see.</font>

271
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The topics can change, so it depends.</font>

272
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Like the type of ladies I like,</font>

273
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or how many ladies I've 
fallen in love with?</font>

274
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who would ask such questions 
to a 12-year-old?</font>

275
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are so many things I'd like to 
ask you about wind magic. May I?</font>

276
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm? Yes, of course.</font>

277
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Riyah Houghs.</font>

278
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes!</font>

279
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will we be dismissed after the interview?</font>

280
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's correct.</font>

281
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't goodbye, right?!</font>

282
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be in the same class, I hope!</font>

283
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can tell me about light magic then!</font>

284
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reyes Saint-Lance.</font>

285
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

286
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd rather be alone with a lady.</font>

287
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a coincidence. Same here.</font>

288
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Kunon.</font>

289
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the practical skill test,</font>

290
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you had a next move in mind if 
there was a time limit, didn't you?</font>

291
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I was thinking of a direct approach.</font>

292
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was hoping I could do something with 
erosion, fusion, and gaining control.</font>

293
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eroding my wind with 
your mist to fuse with it,</font>

294
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then interfering with my magical power 
to gain control of the wind?</font>

295
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something like that.</font>

296
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You thought it was possible?</font>

297
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My gut said it was.</font>

298
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gaining control of another is easier 
from the inside rather than the outside.</font>

299
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic is connected to the 
caster, so introduce water...</font>

300
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or rather, let it interfere 
with the other's magic.</font>

301
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Water can penetrate most materials.</font>

302
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

303
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor, I think water 
is the best attribute.</font>

304
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I could say that 
it was also the strongest,</font>

305
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I didn't beat my master, 
so I can't claim that yet.</font>

306
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I want to study a 
lot here, learn many things,</font>

307
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and surpass my master someday.</font>

308
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, you surprised me.</font>

309
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought it was almost time.</font>

310
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my turn, right? Let's go.</font>

311
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Okay.</font>

312
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor, may I ask 
you to lead me by hand?</font>

313
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not possible, because 
you're Zeon's student.</font>

314
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please go in.</font>

315
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Professor Sayfie, what's on 
the other side of the door?</font>

316
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you really can't see.</font>

317
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wind?</font>

318
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does it lead to outside?</font>

319
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one knows for sure, but to put it 
simply, it's night beyond this door.</font>

320
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Night?</font>

321
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there solid ground?</font>

322
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't fall.</font>

323
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right by yourself?</font>

324
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can come along if necessary.</font>

325
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be fine.</font>

326
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Night, huh?</font>

327
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is absolutely fascinating.</font>

328
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't see anything.</i></font>

329
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My magical power can't detect anything,</i></font>

330
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and my Glass Eye can't 
see anything, either.</i></font>

331
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's been a while since 
I've become totally blind.</i></font>

332
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The ground is earth. I feel wind.</i></font>

333
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I smell dirt and grass.</i></font>

334
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's probably a sky 
full of stars above me.</i></font>

335
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't see it, though.</i></font>

336
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're Zeonly's student?</font>

337
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When did they...?</i></font>

338
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There are seven of them in total.</i></font>

339
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Kunon Gurion.</font>

340
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That man was a prodigy, enough 
to make me acknowledge him.</font>

341
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, what about you—</font>

342
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please do not get too close to me.</font>

343
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

344
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a fiancée, so I should 
not get too close to other women.</font>

345
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I see you incessantly 
hit on the saint?</font>

346
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I just wanted to ask 
her about magic. Alone.</font>

347
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And being alone with her is...?</font>

348
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that aside, I'm an old 
hag, much older than you are.</font>

349
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it still an issue?</font>

350
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. A gentleman never changes how 
he treats women based on their age.</font>

351
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a mature lady who knows 
both the bitter and the sweet.</font>

352
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I bet you're even more skilled 
as a sorcerer than my master.</font>

353
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm already so fascinated by you!</font>

354
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What if there's a mistake?</font>

355
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter how old you get, you just 
never know between a man and a woman.</font>

356
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

357
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you learned anything today?</font>

358
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

359
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The magic I saw was all new to me, 
and I'd love to apply it to mine!</font>

360
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to try it out 
as soon as I get home.</font>

361
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just can't wait!</font>

362
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How energetic you are.</font>

363
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's fine.</font>

364
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The interview is over.</font>

365
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is? May I leave?</font>

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I will put you in the 
advanced class, like you wanted.</font>

367
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

368
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Study hard there and 
build your track record.</font>

369
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then eventually, I, Gray Rouva, shall—</font>

370
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for your time!</font>

371
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That stings a bit.</font>

372
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I told Zeonly I would teach him,
 his face lit up with joy.</font>

373
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter. Take good care of 
this year's trainees, okay?</font>

374
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've taken in a student.</i></font>

375
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm very proud of him.</i></font>

376
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's one in a million, and he'll 
easily surpass you in a few years.</i></font>

377
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not as special as me, of course.</i></font>

378
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He hasn't changed.</font>

379
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I know I overdid it at school.</i></font>

380
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But please don't take 
what I did out on my student.</i></font>

381
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's still a kid and sensitive.</i></font>

382
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So allow him time to grow 
into a troublemaker.</i></font>

383
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Kunon! Welcome back!</font>

384
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How was school?</font>

385
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was fun. But I missed you, Rinko.</font>

386
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same here!</font>

387
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I missed you so much that I had</font>

388
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">three yummy parfaits while 
I was waiting for you.</font>

389
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me where you went later.</font>

390
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! So you can go on a date?</font>

391
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you ask a girl out already?!</font>

392
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I would never.</font>

393
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only have eyes for you, Rinko.</font>

394
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, it sounds so flat.</font>

395
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't ask anyone out, did you?</font>

396
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't, right?!</font>

397
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow him to grow into 
a troublemaker, huh?</font>

398
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kunon Gurion...</i></font>

399
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I know he will become 
the Cerulean Sorcerer.</i></font>

400
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In any case, that boy...</font>

401
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He tried to see something.</font>

402
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:46,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was still unfinished, but he used 
a spell I've never seen before.</font>

403
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is why magic is so fun.</font>
