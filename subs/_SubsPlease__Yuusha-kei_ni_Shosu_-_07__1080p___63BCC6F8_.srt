1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did well, Xylo.</font>

2
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me to praise you as well.</font>

3
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo Forbartz.</font>

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's talk about what happened 
after you defeated Demon Lord Iblis.</font>

5
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not in the mood for 
all that politicking crap.</font>

6
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'd like you to hear this.</font>

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need you to, in fact.</font>

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Bring that over here!</font>

9
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}S'more where that came from!</font>

10
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Everything's fresh!</font>

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Get it moving.</font>

12
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}As such, you and Goddess Teoritta...</font>

13
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}have officially been allotted to 
my Thirteenth Order of Holy Knights.</font>

14
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Allotted to"?</font>

15
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are we, equipment?</font>

16
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The military and the Temple
 are still debating</font>

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goddess Teoritta's 
questionable standing,</font>

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but your incredible accomplishments 
at the fortress have caused a sea change.</font>

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo. I want you to continue 
protecting Goddess Teoritta.</font>

20
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want me to protect her...</font>

21
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't had a single day off in ages.</font>

22
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take us off the front lines.</font>

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was already the plan.</font>

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm assigning your hero unit to protect
 Goddess Teoritta, here in Port City Ioff.</font>

26
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying this city's more dangerous
 than the battlefield?</font>

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your assessment is correct.</font>

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A group of heretics 
expelled from the Temple</font>

29
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are refusing to accept this new goddess.</font>

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've joined with a religious order 
of assassins and intend to do her—</font>

31
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough. You can fill me in later.</font>

32
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo.</font>

33
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shall protect me.</font>

34
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We and the heroes...</font>

35
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have time off, Xylo!</font>

36
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear you've put down 
a few Demon Blights, Xylo.</font>

37
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. Hey, Jayce.</font>

38
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard about those 
three Demon Lords you dealt with.</font>

39
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounded like Dotta and Norgalle 
did most of the work,</font>

40
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm willing to accept
that Iblis was all you.</font>

41
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got two, though.</font>

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not inflating those numbers?</font>

43
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rhyno was on the western front with you.</font>

44
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was being insubordinate again.</font>

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll be in a cell for a while.</font>

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A prison cell for a penal hero, huh?</font>

47
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, I've taken down two to your one.</font>

48
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That means I win, loser.</font>

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I beg your pardon?</font>

50
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo is my knight.</font>

51
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will not malign him so.</font>

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're the goddess? 
I hear Dotta found you.</font>

53
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Must be nice to have 
a kid to keep you safe.</font>

54
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-The sheer insolence!</font>

55
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have never experienced 
such a total lack of respect!</font>

56
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't bother. He won't change 
just because you get mad with him.</font>

57
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Dotta didn't find her. He stole her.</font>

58
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the Holy Knights.</font>

59
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same thing, if you ask me.</font>

60
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I give a damn 
about human legalities.</font>

61
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, pony up. I gotta get back 
before Neely starts sulking.</font>

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give my best to Neely.</font>

63
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo! What is wrong with that man?</font>

64
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Jayce. He's our unit's dragoon.</font>

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's an idiot who grew and sold 
illegal substances for dragons.</font>

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They made him a hero for that?</font>

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That and insurrection.</font>

68
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say he went against the military 
in hopes of freeing their dragons.</font>

69
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Normally, they would've had him 
in custody in a day,</font>

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he's from a big-name noble family, 
and dragons love the guy.</font>

71
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It became a big enough deal
they named it: "Jayce's Revolt."</font>

72
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heroes truly are an eccentric bunch.</font>

73
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I may...</font>

74
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Let's keep a cool head, Xylo. Please.</font>

75
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait a minute. If the Mastibolt cavalry
hadn't showed up when they did,</font>

76
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it would've been much worse,
 don't you agree?</font>

77
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup. That's why I'm only hitting you twice.</font>

78
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo! Violence is not the answer!</font>

79
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I disagree. There's still something
 he's not telling us.</font>

80
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's not true.</font>

81
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well, Frenci <i>may</i> have said 
she wanted to speak with you,</font>

82
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that she'd kill me if I didn't 
make it happen right away...</font>

83
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frenci? Who might that be?</font>

84
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My former fiancée.</font>

85
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're in an awful state, Xylo.</font>

86
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong with you? Sit down at once.</font>

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't grown in the slightest.</font>

88
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were on the level of a fly before, 
but now, you're like a caterpillar.</font>

89
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A grave situation.</font>

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think you could be less insulting 
with your comparisons?</font>

91
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Do flat-landers consider 
that expression insulting?</font>

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am merely encouraging you 
to behave in a way</font>

93
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that befits a future member
 of the Mastibolt family.</font>

94
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess it's a cultural difference.</font>

95
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll revise my thinking.</font>

96
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did not mean to cause offense.</font>

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is the goddess in question?</font>

98
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't glare at her. You'll scare her.</font>

99
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I am not afraid of her.</font>

100
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I <i>am</i> a goddess, you know.</font>

101
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nor should you be. I am not glaring.</font>

102
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frenci was your name, yes?</font>

103
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What precisely is your relationship 
to my knight, Xylo?</font>

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you that earlier. 
She's my former fiancée.</font>

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Former" is inaccurate.</font>

106
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our oath remains intact, Xylo.</font>

107
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, come on. I'm a hero, remember?</font>

108
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have the right to get married.</font>

109
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Legally, I'm not even considered human.</font>

110
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frenci, was it?</font>

111
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This man is a hero and my knight.</font>

112
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:57,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He has devoted his life 
to offering me reverence and praise.</font>

113
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Therefore, I regret to inform you...</font>

114
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He <i>cannot</i> be married!</font>

115
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo, another curious creature
 has taken to you.</font>

116
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm reminded of the time my father's 
long-eared armadillo took a liking to you.</font>

117
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, while it scratched <i>you</i>.</font>

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Only because that western merchant—</font>

119
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait one moment! It is unfair to recount
 your shared history in my presence.</font>

120
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it is the height of disrespect 
to compare a goddess to an animal.</font>

121
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:30,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regardless, I am attempting 
to arrange a pardon for you.</font>

122
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute. I—</font>

123
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will remain in this city for some time.</font>

124
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see...</font>

125
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must locate the Demon Blight.</font>

126
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean by that?</font>

127
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How it sounds.</font>

128
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About one month ago,</font>

129
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the night-gaunt chiefs and I embarked
 on maneuvers to track a Demon Blight.</font>

130
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But a few days ago, their entire force 
disappeared in the vicinity of this town.</font>

131
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Disappeared?</font>

132
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Demon Blight 
Number Fifty-Nine: "Spriggan."</font>

133
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe...</font>

134
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it has disguised itself as a human.</font>

135
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Demon Lord disguised 
as a human? Spriggan?</font>

136
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A rare ability among Demon Lords.</font>

137
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn. That's a real headache.</font>

138
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may already have infiltrated the city.</font>

139
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be careful.</font>

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The creature has already laid waste 
to one of our territories.</font>

141
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This concludes our discussion. However...</font>

142
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I ask who is eavesdropping over there?</font>

143
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I didn't intend...</font>

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a rule. As their supervisor, I must 
monitor interactions with the heroes.</font>

145
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I will be leaving, then.</font>

146
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I advise you to come up 
with a better excuse next time.</font>

147
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I very much wish to go.</font>

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Venetim and Dotta told me all about it.</font>

149
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The west and north sides of the city
 are full of rare goods,</font>

150
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and all of the food is free.</font>

151
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only free for 
that sticky-fingered Dotta.</font>

152
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we're not going sightseeing.</font>

153
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:17,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're trying to lure out those Temple
 heretics after you and arrest them.</font>

154
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, we are. I am well aware.</font>

155
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just a bit of advice:</font>

156
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell anyone about that Holy Sword.</font>

157
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If those Galtuile bastards find out 
about it, our lives will get a lot harder.</font>

158
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Worry not.</font>

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am a goddess. I know just what to do.</font>

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll accompany you in town.</font>

161
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be the goddess's sword and shield
 should anything happen.</font>

162
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, the question is...</font>

163
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who else to bring?</font>

164
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Venetim's no use as a bodyguard.</font>

165
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't let Dotta stroll 
around town without shackles.</font>

166
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Majesty will make a fuss about 
how he <i>himself</i> needs bodyguards.</font>

167
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for Tatsuya...</font>

168
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's best we keep him out of the public eye.</font>

169
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a lot of options to choose from.</font>

170
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those morons expect me 
to keep Neely in here?</font>

171
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm at least gonna give her room 
to spread her wings and tail.</font>

172
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, Jayce...</font>

173
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have some important commander
 work to get on with. May I go yet?</font>

174
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's the most powerful 
force in this unit?</font>

175
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and Neely, of course.</font>

176
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So do what it takes 
to keep it in fighting form.</font>

177
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And shut your mouth, conman.</font>

178
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just hold on a little longer, Neely.</font>

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make you a really nice bed soon.</font>

180
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, those other dragons? 
I was just measuring them, you know.</font>

181
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't peeking under 
their wings or anything.</font>

182
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't. I swear.</font>

183
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Have I ever lied to you, Neely?</font>

184
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This could go on a while.</font>

185
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Wait! Wait!</font>

186
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}She asked me to do it. 
I didn't have a choice.</font>

187
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just one option left.</font>

188
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, lemme tell you! 
Those guys are the <i>worst</i>!</font>

189
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gwen Mohsa calls itself
a religious order, right?</font>

190
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they raised me, and even <i>I</i> thought 
those guys were pure evil.</font>

191
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're talking human sacrifice, 
offering kids to the goddesses...</font>

192
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then there's "Holy Communion," which—</font>

193
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop now.</font>

194
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Kay.</font>

195
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he's going to go on like that, 
why did we bother with disguises?</font>

196
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of...</font>

197
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yours is excellent.</font>

198
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't expecting you to dress as a man.</font>

199
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the perfect bodyguard guise.</font>

200
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Xylo.</font>

201
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us buy a keepsake.</font>

202
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To remember this day.</font>

203
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember what, exactly?</font>

204
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How a great goddess 
and her equally great knight</font>

205
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">toured a city's streets together
 for the first time.</font>

206
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, for that, huh?</font>

207
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what do you want?</font>

208
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must join me in choosing.</font>

209
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It <i>is</i> for both of us, after all.</font>

210
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This fabric, perhaps?</font>

211
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does it not shimmer in the light?</font>

212
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must've been brought 
from the west, across Korio Bay.</font>

213
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lots of odd knickknacks here.</font>

214
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what about this bracelet?</font>

215
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you not think it would suit me?</font>

216
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like jade. You could buy 
a house for that money.</font>

217
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd better keep Dotta away from here.</font>

218
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did not ask the price.
Nor does this concern Dotta.</font>

219
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav. If you were the assassin, 
what would you do here?</font>

220
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd probably mix in with the crowd.</font>

221
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A quick slash as I walked past.</font>

222
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo! You must listen to me.</font>

223
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish you to choose our keepsake.</font>

224
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine.</font>

225
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, even I can judge 
the quality of these.</font>

226
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knives?</font>

227
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe not. Giving weapons 
to children is too dangerous.</font>

228
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shall teach me to wield it.</font>

229
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pick one now.</font>

230
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

231
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about this one?</font>

232
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent. It is beautiful.</font>

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take this.</font>

234
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one, too.</font>

235
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I pay with scrip?</font>

236
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teoritta. Use this if it comes to it.</font>

237
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

238
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey. Sweet gear.</font>

239
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo, swap to the alternate route!</font>

240
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

241
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Teoritta.</font>

242
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Has it begun?</font>

243
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. We'll do our sightseeing this way.</font>

244
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on here? Why aren't
 the Holy Knights here to meet us?</font>

245
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't good. 
Something must have happened.</font>

246
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those guys back there weren't 
religious order assassins.</font>

247
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't seem like they'd had
 any real training.</font>

248
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They could be allies of the Demon Blight.</font>

249
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coexisters, huh?</font>

250
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One way or another, it's someone 
who benefits from the goddess's death.</font>

251
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think they'd infiltrated 
the military, but...</font>

252
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Freaky!</font>

253
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who the hell <i>are</i> you?</font>

254
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's got nasty tricks, bro.</font>

255
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This freakin' hurts.</font>

256
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo. What should I...</font>

257
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay back. We'll deal with this quickly.</font>

258
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't!</font>

259
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A seal compound?</font>

260
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this.</font>

261
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you keep going?</font>

262
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do you think you're talking to?</font>

263
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be quiet and focus.</font>

264
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough, Shiji Bau.</font>

265
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're fighting the penal hero 
who accompanies a goddess.</font>

266
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your chance of victory 
is one in a thousand.</font>

267
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's time to withdraw.</font>

268
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear me, Shiji Bau?</font>

269
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You rank amateur.</font>

270
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not supposed to 
blurt out my name, Boojum.</font>

271
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I see. I didn't realize.</font>

272
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know how things work
 in this business.</font>

273
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you'll continue instructing me
 as the more experienc—</font>

274
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir, hurry! Before the Holy Knights arrive!</font>

275
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quiet.</font>

276
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm talking to Shiji Bau.</font>

277
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's rude to interrupt.</font>

278
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you forget being told 
to avoid unnecessary killing as well?</font>

279
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Killing?</font>

280
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't kill him.</font>

281
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be mean.</font>

282
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still ripped off his jaw.</font>

283
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a ridiculous person, 
from start to finish.</font>

284
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kivia!</font>

285
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Niskeph!</font>

286
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't fire your lightning staves.</font>

287
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting shot in the back hurts a little.</font>

288
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you be the infamous
 penal hero, Xylo Forbartz?</font>

289
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your name is Boojum, huh? 
Were you in a circus troupe at some point?</font>

290
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

291
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're an excellent 
knife-thrower, though.</font>

292
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd fit in well at the circus yourself.</font>

293
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I performed in one for three years.</font>

294
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The flying trapeze was my specialty.</font>

295
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? That explains it, then.</font>

296
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can say without exaggeration 
that you're the best I've ever seen.</font>

297
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have my respect.</font>

298
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boojum. Watch your mouth.</font>

299
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't give them extra information.</font>

300
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. That makes sense.</font>

301
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm learning a lot today.</font>

302
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This ain't good.</font>

303
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That woman, Shiji Bau, 
is a famous adventurer.</font>

304
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet she's got a better kill rate 
on her hits than you.</font>

305
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably. I'm such 
a sweet li'l softie, after all.</font>

306
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo. Shall I call the rain of swords?</font>

307
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Better not.</font>

308
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I could—</font>

309
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know how painful it is 
for a goddess to hurt a human.</font>

310
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But something is wrong.</font>

311
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have the strangest feeling...</font>

312
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bro, we got incoming.</font>

313
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, just in time.</font>

314
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Help!</font>

315
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

316
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We came to this cramped little place
 like you asked.</font>

317
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better show Neely some gratitude.</font>

318
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Thanks, Neely.</font>

319
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks a bunch, Big Sis Neely!</font>

320
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neely, you're so kind.</font>

321
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll get a real day off soon.</font>

322
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's fly out over the sea tomorrow.</font>

323
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

324
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dragon flames are a challenge to endure.</font>

325
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have enough blood.</font>

326
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was educational.</font>

327
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be going now.</font>

328
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was that guy made of?</font>

329
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After being burned by Neely's flame...</font>

330
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teoritta.</font>

331
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What were you about to say 
about that hunchbacked man?</font>

332
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is difficult to describe.</font>

333
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But for some reason, I felt very little 
hesitation over attacking him.</font>

334
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is possible the man 
we just saw was Spriggan.</font>

335
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Impact"><b><font size="45"><font color="#090000">Sentenced to Be a Hero</font></font></b></font></font>
