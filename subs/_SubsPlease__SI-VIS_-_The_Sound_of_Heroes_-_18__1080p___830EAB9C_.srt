184
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do I smile? Do I raise a cry of victory?</font>

185
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I be relieved

187
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,550

196
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything about you is inadequate!</font>

199
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,180

201
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,030

202
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samael and Medea were mistaken.</font>

203
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I fail to see the value they saw in you.</font>

207
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,420

208
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is too early to turn our backs on Nagi.</font>

209
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she was unable to do anything.</font>

210
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she couldn't drive me away 
or protect her friends,</font>

211
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's no way she could save XENOS.</font>

212
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She grew up on Earth.</font>

213
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will take time for her to gain 
XENOS's, the Diva's, power.</font>

214
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not everyone is strong, almighty,

215
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, neither am I.</font>

216
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yes, Medea. You're inadequate.</i></font>

217
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your loyalty to XENOS, 
your devotion to your duty.</font>

218
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I devote my life to righteous duty.</font>

219
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But does your decision 
fall under that category?</font>

220
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You doubt my judgment?</font>

221
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she disappears, so does 
the hope for Earth.</font>

229
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is true that Earth may 
not have the order we do.</font>

230
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're cumbersome, 
disorganized, and incohesive.</font>

231
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're animals who release

232
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,790

234
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're doing something we can't.</font>

254
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,690

263
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you come with me, Miss Diva?</font>

264
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I kindly gave you a chance for survival.</font>

265
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd be better off doing exactly

266
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A chance for survival?</font>

267
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, because you're Eden the Diva's—</font>

268
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there a chance for Kyoya to survive?</font>

269
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

270
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A chance for μ, Soji, June-san...</font>

271
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:57,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">everyone at Harmonia, everyone 
Kyoya holds dear, to survive?</font>

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Look at that.</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's shamefully begging for their lives!</i></font>

274
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me!</font>

275
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:14,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you stay here until the Mirage closes, 
then you disappear along with SI-VIS.</font>

276
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, SI-VIS, Harmonia, they all disappear 
from the memories of the world.</font>

277
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we'll take this world 
without any resistance.</font>

278
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the exact outcome Apollo had in mind.</font>

279
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you agree to my condition, 
you can hold on to a glimmer of hope.</font>

280
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although that choice may be 
a double-edged sword for Earth.</font>

281
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your condition?</font>

282
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't do it, Nagi.</font>

283
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't listen to what they tell you.</font>

284
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoya!</font>

285
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here we go.</font>

286
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you want to say goodbye?</font>

287
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

288
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know I'll be seeing him again very soon.</font>

289
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:03,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring Pandora to Earth, and give 
the one-and-only Elpis to SI-VIS.</font>

290
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Medea, you take this one.</font>

291
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's getting exciting.</font>

292
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With our convictions at stake,
why don't we destroy each other?</font>

293
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

294
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that? Is it floating?</font>

295
