00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's one thing I want to tell 
you about the Blood Rage...</font>

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You don't know everything

5
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}There's actually a technique to raise</font>

6
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}the purity of your dragon blood 
and empower your bloodline,</font>

7
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">while remaining unaffected by it.</font>

8
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But since it drains you heavily, 
it uses a dragon blood serum.</font>

9
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But we only have enough for one person.</font>

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Do you know about the Nibelungen Plan?</font>

11
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's something the School Board
 has been plotting.</font>

12
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The most talented student will be
 chosen to employ that technique.</font>

13
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Meanwhile, they also aim to eradicate 
individuals with dangerous bloodlines.</font>

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You, for instance.</font>

15
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Or perhaps Lu Mingfei.</font>

16
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,970
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If this is a Gattuso family project,</font>

17
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the one they opt for will
 definitely be Caesar.</font>

18
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Correct. But it means more 
to you than it does to him.</font>

19
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,800
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">For you, it's the only way to survive.</font>

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What do I do?</font>

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Prove yourself greater than Caesar.</font>

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Go to Shin and kill a Dragon 
Emperor, just as Caesar did.</font>

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Understood.</font>

24
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Everyone should have an equal chance.</font>

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Make haste and prepare.
 You leave in three hours.</font>

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why are you forcing Finger to go?</font>

27
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He was originally an A-rank student.</font>

28
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He was wounded on a certain mission 
and ended up in his current state.</font>

29
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Ten years ago, he was much like you.</font>

30
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He needs a chance to find himself again.</font>

31
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A knife?</font>

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It has the power to slay the Four Rulers.</font>

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A friend's family had an 
alchemical weapon that shattered.</font>

34
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The fragments were used to create this.</font>

35
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Best of luck.</font>

36
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thank you, Principal.</font>

37
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll leave in two hours.</font>

38
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I have prepared the weapons we need.</font>

39
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's that?</font>

40
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A modified blowtorch.</font>

41
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We call it "Dragon's Breath."</font>

42
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Its chemical fuel is nitroglycerin, 
and you can infuse it with mercury.</font>

43
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,800
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It can do some damage, but if you run 
into a first generation dragon...</font>

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well, you can use it as a flashlight.</font>

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This is a lighter?</font>

46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Did you turn it into a bomb?</font>

47
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,410
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Anyone could do that.</font>

48
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So instead I gave it voice 
capabilities and a speaker.</font>

49
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,430
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's so cool!</font>

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Senpai, can I take it?</font>

51
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Of course. I assume you'll
 want a bazooka too?</font>

52
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll pass.</font>

53
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I helped Chu Zihang, 
but we're not friends.</font>

54
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Will you accept a gift from an enemy?</font>

55
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Or will you join the Student 
Union and become my friend?</font>

56
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Sure. But as a spy.</font>

57
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is that all right?</font>

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll consider it.</font>

59
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Caesar, I have something special for you.</font>

60
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,660
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The School Board told me to 
give it to you personally.</font>

61
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Interesting. Want to see what's in it?</font>

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Sure.</font>

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A crossbow?</font>

64
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Philosopher's stone?</font>

65
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Pseudomatter. Crystallized fire element.</font>

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Specially refined.</font>

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Seems strong.</font>

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Gattuso family is giving 
you all the support it can.</font>

69
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please slay the Dragon Emperor 
of Earth and Mountains.</font>

70
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Are you from the clan?</font>

71
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm the Deputy Leader of 
the Equipment Department.</font>

72
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If you run into a Dragon 
Emperor, don't hesitate.</font>

73
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,330
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They won't give you time to think.</font>

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Senpai!</font>

75
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Can you give us some privacy?</font>

76
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll meet in two hours, 
then leave for Shin immediately.</font>

77
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Okay, I'll bring Nono, 
and I won't be late!</font>

78
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The photocopies of those 
documents you requested.</font>

79
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Lionheart Society had them.</font>

80
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's all there is to know
 about Blood Rage.</font>

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You should be able to interpret them.</font>

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You keep your promises.</font>

83
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Chu Zihang lets you handle these 
things because he trusts you.</font>

84
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Aren't you betraying him 
by giving this to me?</font>

85
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's none of your business.</font>

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,660
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That was the deal, right?</font>

87
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If you supported him at the hearing, 
I would give you these copies.</font>

88
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I've got other stuff to do. Goodbye.</font>

89
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Won't Chu Zihang hate you</font>

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">when he finds out that someone 
else can use Blood Rage?</font>

91
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's just a selfish child who 
can't take care of himself.</font>

92
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A selfish child?</font>

93
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes. A stubborn, selfish child.</font>

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,900
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He wants everyone else to save him.</font>

95
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're going a little 
too far to help him.</font>

96
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Me liking him and him liking 
me are two separate things.</font>

97
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If I were you, I'd fight to win him.</font>

98
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Goodnight.</font>

99
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Thank you for flying with us.</i></font>

100
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The seats are so cramped.</font>

101
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's a direct flight. Fourteen hours.</font>

102
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Get some rest, and you'll be
 good to go when we land.</font>

103
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Always the perfect student.</font>

104
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,690

105
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,690
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Night.</font>

106
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I guess I'll hit the can.</font>

107
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Th-They're all...</font>

108
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Are you looking for your seat?</font>

109
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm sorry, everyone on this flight is...</font>

110
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm aware.</font>

111

cannot board this flight.</font>

113
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,220

114
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,550
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">...is a flying hybrid fortress.</font>

115
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,600

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why are you being so stingy
 if we're related?</font>

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Two drinks for the whole flight?</font>

118

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is that you, Tang? It's been forever!</font>

132
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We meet again!</font>

133
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,360
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">These are my friends, 
Finger and Chu Zihang.</font>

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Nice to meet you.</font>

135
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,830
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thanks.</font>

136
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Are they dragonslayers too?</font>

137
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">"Too"? Do you mean...</font>

138
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes. This is a charter flight, after all.</font>

139
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,150
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Passengers are checked before the 
flight. They're all hybrids.</font>

140
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They're here to slay the dragon.</font>

141
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Do you need that many people?</font>

142
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Listen, mister, are you serious 
about killing a dragon?</font>

143
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm not that arrogant.</font>

144
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,400
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's a big event. I want to see 
it for myself, or I'll regret it.</font>

145
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So I took time off and came 
with some friends of mine.</font>

146
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,970
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll have a vacation, too.</font>

147
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Look, some people are 
bringing their families.</font>

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So if you can't kill the dragon,
you just go on vacation?</font>

149
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll look for dragons while 
we enjoy our vacation.</font>

150
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Great plan...</font>

151
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I think I've felt this presence before...</font>

152
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's right! A tanker just ran 
aground and sank five minutes ago.</font>

153
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Self driving again? You're so lazy.</font>

154
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Renewable energy stocks are 
going to go through the roof!</font>

155
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So...</font>

156
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,960
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Looks like you're keeping busy here.</font>

157
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Don't touch me.</font>

158
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It won't kill you, will it?</font>

159
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Did you look at the documentation?</font>

160
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That bounty site that's 
recruiting hunters?</font>

161
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I saw it. Whoever posted it is clever.</font>

162
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They've gathered hybrids 
from all around the world.</font>

163
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">In just the past week, three charter 
flights came from An to Shin.</font>

164
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Over 1,000 hybrids are here in Shin.</font>

165
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,690
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Some of them have such weak bloodlines</font>

166
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">that just getting close to the 
Dragon Emperor will kill them.</font>

167
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They're coming not just from within 
Shin, but around the world.</font>

168
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And that includes Finger von 
Frings, Chu Zihang, and Lu...</font>

169
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I saw our little baby.</font>

170
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Which means we should have new 
orders from the boss, right?</font>

171
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,830
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I got an email from the 
boss three hours ago.</font>

172
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We're to make sure Lu Mingfei 
personally slays the Dragon Emperor.</font>

173
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Not again...</font>

174
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">How much time do we have to spend 
looking out for that loser?</font>

175
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">How lucky can one guy get?</font>

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Everybody wants to be his babysitter.</font>

177
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I don't know what the boss is thinking,</font>

178
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but orders are orders.</font>

179
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lu Mingfei has to kill the Dragon Emperor,</font>

180
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and anyone else who sees the 
Dragon Emperor has to die.</font>

181
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So the charter flights were cursed, huh?</font>

182
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Fine, I'll take them out, too.</font>

183
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But the problem is Lu Mingfei.</font>

184
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">How does that loser 
kill a Dragon Emperor?</font>

185
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I think it's doable.</font>

186
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's got the Seven Deadly Sins.</font>

187
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They're capable of killing 
any Dragon Emperor.</font>

188
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's just a matter of 
whether he can draw them.</font>

189
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Do we really have to do all 
this to help that kid?</font>

190
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's going through the boss's head?</font>

191
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Nothing, probably.</font>

192
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lu Mingfei's a lucky boy.</font>

193
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is he really happy to have 
everyone helping him?</font>

194
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,690
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Nobody can give him happiness.</font>

195
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's standing on the edge of loneliness.</font>

196
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And each time he's about to fall 
into the abyss of sadness,</font>

197
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">somebody reaches out and 
offers a hand to stop him.</font>

198
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I've got this feeling...</font>

199
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That if someday he really does despair...</font>

200
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What'll happen?</font>

201
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He might turn into a demon.</font>

202
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lots of data, no clues.</font>

203
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Can we really find the 
Dragon Emperor like this?</font>

204
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Where'd Lu Mingfei go?</font>

205
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Net cafe.</font>

206
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He said he'd get in the 
way if he gamed here.</font>

207
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,810
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We're relying on you.</font>

208
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They're a team of elites, 
but we're just the unwanted stepchildren.</font>

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're not using that phrase right.</font>

210
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A stepchild is a child 
from a previous marriage.</font>

211
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Like me, for instance.</font>

212
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What are you fiddling with?</font>

213
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Aren't we here to slay dragons?</font>

214
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Shouldn't we go grab our gear
 and hunt some dragons?</font>

215
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If "gear" means "cameras," 
 then everybody's doing it for us.</font>

216
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,830
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They went straight to the tourist 
spots from the airport.</font>

217
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There are many traces of dragons,</font>

218
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and both the geography and 
buildings have dragon designs.</font>

219
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But the real information 
we need is still hidden.</font>

220
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's why I'm looking into seismic 
data from the past few years.</font>

221
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,660
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Earthquakes went up by a 
factor of ten this year.</font>

222
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I built an inference model 
that might help us pinpoint</font>

223
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the epicenter where 
the Dragon Emperor is.</font>

224
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,400
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Wow! I'm impressed!</font>

225
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A little hard to understand 
for a humanities student, huh?</font>

226
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Am I in humanities?</font>

227
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I've been at the school nine years,
 and I never knew!</font>

228
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So your theory is that the Dragon 
Emperor is in a single place?</font>

229
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,830
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Any chance he's moving around?</font>

230
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why would he?</font>

231
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is he commuting to work?</font>

232
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,670
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Fair point.</font>

233
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He'd stay hidden and build his power.</font>

234
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's planning on reviving at full 
strength and wiping us all out.</font>

235
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But that data will help us 
get one up on Caesar's team.</font>

236
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Maybe. There's a lot of stuff in 
a city that can cause tremors.</font>

237
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And we don't have time 
to examine every one.</font>

238
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Chu Zihang!</font>

239
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Xia Mi is here!</font>

240
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Come in!</font>

241
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hello, Senpai!</font>

242
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What a mess...</font>

243
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So this is like a boys' dorm?</font>

244
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Wow, she's so cute!</font>

245
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Let your Senpai give you a hug!</font>

246
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I figured you'd be hungry, 
so I brought you some snacks.</font>

247
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Wow! Local gourmet food?</font>

248
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Huh? Where's Lu?</font>

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's off training.</font>

250
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,510
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We can split his share.</font>

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm local, so I bought these while 
I was taking a side trip home.</font>

252
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm so happy I could cry!</font>

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's our spy for you!</font>

254
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So your heart's always with us, huh?</font>

255
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Of course!</font>

256
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're the most wonderful 
guy of all, Finger!</font>

257
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey, Chu Zihang! Did you hear that?</font>

258
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My irresistible charm is giving us an 
escape from eating just junk food!</font>

259
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,900
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Senpai, what's this?</font>

260
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Looking for the Dragon 
Emperor using seismic data?</font>

261
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes. But there's too much 
data for me to analyze.</font>

262
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Like waves on the surface while the 
fish hides at the bottom of the lake.</font>

263
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">When it fully awakens, it'll burst 
through the water in dragon form.</font>

264
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But it'll be too late then.</font>

265
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So for now, it's in human form?</font>

266
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Correct.</font>

267
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Which is why it was able to destroy those 
buildings without attracting suspicion.</font>

268
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But its power is limited like that.</font>

269
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's the same as it was with 
Dragon Emperor Norton.</font>

270
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It takes time to assume a dragon 
body... Like hatching an egg, huh?</font>

271
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Okay, before that happens, why 
don't you come eat with my family?</font>

272
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,800
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why?</font>

273
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I told them how nice you've 
been, and my parents said—</font>

274
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hold it! You're introducing 
him to your parents?</font>

275
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It was such a brief dream...</font>

276
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,430
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What does that mean?</font>

277
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,580
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Xia Mi, as you can see, I'm busy now.</font>

278
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I don't think I'll have time to go.</font>

279
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Tell them I said hi.</font>

280
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's just a meal. It won't 
take more than a few hours.</font>

281
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My brother wants to see you too.</font>

282
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He was shouting on the phone about 
how much he wants to play with you.</font>

283
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,510
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's why I'm asking you.</font>

284
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Don't say no.</font>

285
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">When is it?</font>

286
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Tomorrow at noon. How does gyoza sound?</font>

287
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Okay.</font>

288
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Sorry, I'm busy.</font>

289
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'd like to go with you, 
but I won't have time.</font>

290
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Busy with what?</font>

291
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Visiting a museum.</font>

292
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Anyway, Miss Spy, where is Caesar now?</font>

293
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The antiques district, I think.</font>

294
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So you're Mr. Lin Fenglong, who 
uses the name "Phoenix" online?</font>

295
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Mr. Caesar Gattuso?</font>

296
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So young.</font>

297
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I didn't come to drink tea.</font>

298
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,190
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll buy your information 
on the dragon for $200,000.</font>

299
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I guess some hunters don't 
mind spending money.</font>

300
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll both get what we want.</font>

301
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's a certain spot on a 
street not far from here...</font>

302
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">During the days of the old dynasty, 
they made gunpowder there.</font>

303
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Back then, it had another name.</font>

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">"The Gunpowder Bureau."</font>

305
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Gunpowder Bureau explosion 
ranks among the top three in history.</font>

306
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's said that all three were caused 
by awakening Dragon Emperors.</font>

307
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Four hundred years ago...</font>

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A certain Dragon Emperor 
revived in this city.</font>

309
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The one you're looking for.</font>

310
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This old book dates from the dynasty era.</font>

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's made from mulberry bark 
and dragon beard grass.</font>

312
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,580
<font size="22"><b><font size="13"><font color="#ffffff"> Records 
of Strange
 Disasters</font></font></b></font>

313
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's written by an unknown author,</font>

314
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,300
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and contains more information about 
the explosion than any other book.</font>

315
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's the only one of 
its kind in the world?</font>

316
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,660
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">No, there are plenty of copies.</font>

317
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,970
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But the one you're holding is 
quite different from the others.</font>

318
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,580
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It contains an extensive 
section on geomancy.</font>

319
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Geomancy?</font>

320
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Feng Shui.</font>

321
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It explains in detail how 
to find dragon veins.</font>

322
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And that's where you'll find the dragon.</font>

323
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Most addresses are the same today as 
they were during the dynasty days.</font>

324
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But some names have changed.</font>

325
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">As thanks for your purchase, 
I'll give you a map from that era.</font>

326
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is it part of your collection?</font>

327
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Nope. It was published by the Shin 
Map Publishing company 20 years ago.</font>

328
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We have a deal.</font>

329
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thank you for your business.</font>

330
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll tell you one thing.</font>

331
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I paid for this because it's real.</font>

332
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But if you've got some other game 
you're playing, you'll regret it.</font>

333
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,970
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Will this do?</font>

334
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I told him what you asked me to.</font>

335
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You can hide, but it won't work.</font>

336
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">His Yanling is "Wind Devil."</font>

337
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm more curious whether that book
 has clues to the Dragon Emperor.</font>

338
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I assume so, but I've failed 
to find it for years.</font>

339
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And there's more and more 
of those small quakes.</font>

340
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">As you people are assuming, the Dragon 
Emperor is running out of patience.</font>

341
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Also, you still owe me another 
payment of 2,500,000 dollars.</font>

342
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's been paid.</font>

343
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But greed will invite your downfall.</font>

344
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What else could someone my age want?</font>

345
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm more curious, actually...</font>

346
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You bought that book from me 
for five million dollars,</font>

347
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and then asked me to hand it to him.</font>

348
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You could have simply 
given it to him yourself.</font>

349
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He doesn't want help.</font>

350
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's in a rebellious phase.</font>

351
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But if he thinks he slew the 
dragon emperor alone...</font>

352
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Won't he simply rebel more?</font>

353
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Even a proud bird will 
someday return to the nest.</font>

354
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,090
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Close this shop and be gone.</font>

355
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I...</font>

356
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Don't try to tell me you're already dead.</font>

357
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You've been crossed off the list,</font>

358
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but your old friend Anjou has 
been looking for you for years.</font>

359
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Mr. Friedrich von Ron.</font>

360
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,670
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Frost talks too much.</font>

361
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:20,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I hope you're the last person 
to learn my name, Mr. Parsi.</font>

362
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's no need to threaten me.</font>

363
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I won't be alive much longer anyway.</font>

364
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Appreciated.</font>

365
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,960
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thank you, sir!</font>

366
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What was that about?</font>

367
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,360
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Two executors went missing in Shin. 
These were their belongings.</font>

368
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Something might be useful.</font>
