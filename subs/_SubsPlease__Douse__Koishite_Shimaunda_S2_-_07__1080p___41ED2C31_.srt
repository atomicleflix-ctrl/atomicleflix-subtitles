00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop grinning at me like 
that while eating.</font>

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't help it. It's good.</font>

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always make a scary face, Syugo.</font>

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so shocked 
when you jumped at Kizuki.</font>

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't seen you make 
a face like that before.</font>

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a chef, what will you do 
if you hurt your hand?</font>

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you out of your mind?</font>

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and Kizuki!</font>

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Throwing hands at each other like that—</font>

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No more talking about Kizuki.</font>

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now...</font>

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The person in front of you...</font>

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is me.</font>

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Out of anyone else, 
the one by your side...</font>

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is me.</font>

19
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2030</font></font>

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My apartment's small, 
but make yourself at home.</font>

21
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

22
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the heck were you and Syugo 
doing in front of Mizuho?</font>

23
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I wanted to be 
the one to lay it on you.</font>

24
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You abandoned Mizuho for three years.</font>

25
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

26
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot.</font>

27
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one you need 
to apologize to is Mizuho.</font>

28
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I ask you something?</font>

29
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd you break up with Mizuho?</font>

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I ran away.</font>

31
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2021</font></font>

32
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget him.</font>

33
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's forget about Kizuki.</font>

34
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet everyone else thinks so too, right?</font>

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough, Kai.</font>

36
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Kizuki's our friend.</font>

37
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate that part about adults.</font>

38
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kai-kun. Everyone...</font>

39
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry.</font>

45
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You idiot!</font>

46
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were so close to finishing that!</font>

47
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're useless! You held me back!</font>

48
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're no friend, Kizuki!</font>

49
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When are we <i>ever</i> going to 
defeat the dragon at this rate?!</font>

50
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys...</font>

51
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long are you going to play games?</font>

52
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about making plans for Kizuki's birthday?</font>

53
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is Kizuki even here?!</font>

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a mess!</font>

55
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now.</font>

56
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You play the game 
for us instead, Shin-chan.</font>

57
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll come back after I take a bath.</font>

58
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to bed!</font>

59
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kai's angry.</font>

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mizuho.</font>

61
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How should I have used this item?</font>

62
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm cramping from laughing so much.</font>

63
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Your timing was completely off.</font>

64
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuho.</font>

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Let me see. For that item...</font>

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to go home.</font>

67
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's almost midnight.</font>

69
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I told my dad.</font>

70
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't be in the room of a guy</font>

71
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who isn't your boyfriend 
this late at night.</font>

72
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You're right.</font>

73
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll head home soon, then.</font>

74
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki. Go drop her off.</font>

75
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. Okay.</font>

76
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for having me over.</font>

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As expected of an honor student.</font>

78
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No "I'll take you home" 
or anything like that?</font>

79
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you thinking, Shin-chan?</font>

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? It's common sense.</font>

81
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leaving those two alone 
on a day like this...</font>

82
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to pretend 
that you're fine.</font>

83
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What?!</font>

84
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You surprised me!</font>

85
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since it's going to be 
tomorrow in ten minutes...</font>

86
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to give you one last kiss 
while I'm still 16.</font>

87
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki.</font>

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anything you want 
for your birthday?</font>

89
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing, really.</font>

90
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's something I want to know.</font>

91
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about me made you like me, Mizuho?</font>

92
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, well...</font>

93
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is so sudden.</font>

94
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

95
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Wha—?</font>

96
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then let's take the scenic route.</font>

97
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not going home until you tell me!</font>

98
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a ton of things I like 
about you, Mizuho.</font>

99
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

100
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way you chase your 
dreams of writing manga.</font>

101
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How you cheer me on when I'm swimming.</font>

102
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How your hair is a mess because 
you're too tired in the mornings.</font>

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

104
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you dissing me in the last one?</font>

105
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What I...</font>

106
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like about you...</font>

107
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why it had to be you...</font>

108
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't think of a word 
that perfectly describes that.</font>

109
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

110
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Hope."</font>

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever since we were kids...</font>

112
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter the hardships, you never 
gave up and swam towards your dreams.</font>

113
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a ray of hope to me.</font>

114
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I leave it at that?</font>

115
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was the time I thought to myself...</i></font>

116
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"I'll continue to swim 
for Mizuho no matter what."</i></font>

117
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wanted to continue 
being her ray of hope.</i></font>

118
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,350

119
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was your first kiss as a 17 year old.</font>

120
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy Birthday, Kizuki.</font>

121
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I really did think that.</i></font>

124
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so frustrated that 
I placed 3rd on that day.</font>

125
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You also accidentally wore 
your senpai's sandals, right?</font>

126
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you even record that?</font>

127
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you practicing too much, Kizuki?</font>

128
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The virus finally calmed down, so new 
matches could start up again this season.</font>

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,940

130
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,610

131

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was all pointless.</font>

267
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not pointless!</font>

268
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you don't really want to quit!</font>

269
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't decide that for me.</font>

270
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you giving up?!</font>

271
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you?</font>

272
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You gave up your dreams to write manga 
and ended up an office worker.</font>

273
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to give up.</font>

274
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep going.</font>

275
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it gets hard and you want to cry,</font>

276
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll wipe your tears away for you.</font>

277
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I decided to start job searching.</font>

278
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

279
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm starting so late that
 I'm worried I won't even get to be</font>

280
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a normal office worker.</font>

281
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Mizuho...</font>

282
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay with that?</font>

283
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

284
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can just read manga as a side hobby.</font>

285
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you to chase your dreams 
in my stead, Kizuki.</font>

286
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't I finally give up, too?</font>

287
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

288
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not a kid anymore.</font>

289
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm tired of foolishly chasing dreams.</font>

290
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not a kid anymore, yeah. But...</font>

291
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well then.</font>

292
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

293
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about us?</font>

294
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That day...</font>

295
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hurt Mizuho...</font>

296
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and ran away.</font>

297
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2030</font></font>

298
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Then I got a job. 
Cut off contact with you all.</font>

299
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And tried to forget everything.</font>

300
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

301
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just couldn't forget 
about swimming and Mizuho.</font>

302
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the end, I'm still 
that timid younger brother.</font>

303
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki. It's okay.</font>

304
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I brought this up.</font>

305
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must have been hard for you.</font>

306
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I found this where you 
and Syugo were fighting.</font>

307
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This old keychain...</font>

308
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long have you held onto this?</font>

309
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw this and immediately figured it out.</font>

310
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That your feelings for Mizuho 
haven't changed at all.</font>

311
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the youngest.</font>

312
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do things at your own pace.</font>

313
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a weakling.</font>

314
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too honest for your own good.</font>

315
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="28" color="#526779"><b>{\an7}Graduation

316
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew that you only had eyes 
for Mizuho for a long time, Kizuki.</font>

317
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's because Mizuho's 
always been looking my way.</font>

318
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even when I was weak with my asthma,</font>

319
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,060

320
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,050

321
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,750

323
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were always looking straight forward.</font>

324
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I loved about you.</font>
