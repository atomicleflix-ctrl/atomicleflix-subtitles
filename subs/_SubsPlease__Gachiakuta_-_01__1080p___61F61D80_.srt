<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay away from the dumpsites, okay?</font>

132
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might get it even worse next time.</font>

133
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously, it's not that bad.</font>

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Compared to the wounds 
my dad left me with, anyway.</font>

135
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Major crimes are an instant death sentence—
a drop into the Pit.</font>

136
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's been the rule of this city 
since ancient times.</font>

137
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your father was thrown into the Pit.</font>

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you should take care of yourself 
and the things you care about.</font>

139
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even in this shit heap of a world.</font>

140
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My hands have been pitch black like this 
for as long as I can remember.</i></font>

141
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sometimes this incredible pain 
runs through them.</i></font>

142
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The stares of people unnerved 
by the sight of my injury</i></font>

143
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>wore down my spirit a lot when I was a kid.</i></font>

144
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was when Regto gave me these gloves.</i></font>

145
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They were beat-up like this even then,</i></font>

146
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but they reduced the pain.</i></font>

147
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I owe Regto more than I can ever repay.</i></font>

148
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, Rudo.</font>

149
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better tell Chiwa how you feel fast, 
or someone's gonna take her from you.</font>

150
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's such a cutie, y'know?</font>

151
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go give her this tomorrow 
with a sweet li'l kiss.</font>

152
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like hell!</font>

153
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's pretty lowbrow, though.</i></font>

154
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do it, or you won't get fed!</font>

155
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do I have to?!</font>

156
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm saying this for your own good!</font>

157
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fix that sour look of yours, too!</font>

158
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on! Smile!</font>

159
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're gonna tear my face open!</font>

160
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Smile...</font>

161
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't smile with your own power,</font>

163
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talking like he knows so much...</font>

164
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way it'll work 
with a face like mine.</font>

165
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stupid busybody.</font>

166
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess she'll still be home now?</font>

167
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They say the Pit is a giant trash dump.</i></font>

168
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All trash ends up there in the end.</i></font>

169
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And anyone who commits a crime

171
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Send the filth to the Pit!</font>

172
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Send the filth to the Pit!</font>

173
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Send the filth to the Pit! 
Send the filth to the Pit!</font>

174
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}That blackness swallowed up my father, too.</i></font>

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}So I hear.</i></font>

176
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What happens to the people sent down there?</i></font>

177
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're sending down another criminal, huh?</font>

178
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

179
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Morning.</font>

180
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ch-Chiwa!</font>

181
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fancy running into you!</font>

182
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't see you around here often.</font>

183
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, well...</font>

184
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pretty awful view, huh?</font>

185
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In a lot of ways...</font>

186
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No different than anywhere 
else in the slums, right?</font>

187
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard they built the slums 
on the edge of the city</font>

188
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they could drive it into our heads...</font>

189
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"If you do anything bad, it's the Pit for you."</font>

190
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's awful, don't you think?</font>

191
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone who lives here has to see
the executions, whether we want to or not.</font>

192
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Rudo.</font>

193
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to see you thrown in there.</font>

194
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know there's a lot of trash that 
doesn't deserve to be thrown out,</font>

195
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if you put yourself in danger 
and get caught just for that...</font>

196
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really could end up getting sent to the Pit.</font>

197
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regto said the same thing.</font>

198
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He worries about you 
because he loves you, too.</font>

199
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Loves me, huh?</font>

200
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Loves me... <i>too</i>?</font>

201
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I didn't mean it like—</font>

202
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... um...</font>

203
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Rudo?</font>

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

205
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That stuffed animal...</font>

206
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This... I just saw it and 
thought you might like it, so...</font>

207
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might not like it, 
since it came from the dump.</font>

208
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I thought it'd be happier with you 
than just sitting there.</font>

209
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

210
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's lovely. I'll treasure him forever.</font>

211
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've gotta tell Regto right away.</i></font>

212
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,960

213
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are Apostles doing here?</font>

214
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen?</font>

215
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way...</font>

216
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've gotta tell him... I mean, brag!</font>

217
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I bet what he'll say is, "go back there

218
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm back. Listen up, Regto.</i></font>

219
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I ran into Chiwa and--</i></font>

235
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run!</font>

236
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Change this shit heap of a world!</font>

237
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

238
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Clear!</font>

239
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Turn yourself in!</font>

240
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We caught you red-handed!

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?</font>

257
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, did you hear?</font>

258
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rudo finally killed someone.</font>

259
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And his adoptive father, at that.</font>

260
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,210
