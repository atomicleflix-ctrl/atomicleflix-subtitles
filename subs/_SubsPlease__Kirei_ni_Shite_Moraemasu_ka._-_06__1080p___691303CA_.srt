45
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,920

when I was cleaning at home.</font>

46
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bought her for my daughter 
when she was little,</font>

47
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so it doesn't seem right 
to just throw her away.</font>

48
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I might clean her up 
so I can put her on display somewhere.</font>

49
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At first, I was planning 
to clean her myself,</font>

50
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but as soon as I tried combing her hair,</font>

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it got tangled up and I was afraid of
 damaging it or yanking some out.</font>

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It appears a little too difficult for me.</font>

53
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think? Or is a doll 
too far outside your area of expertise?</font>

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The fabric looks like 
it's probably real kimono material.</i></font>

55
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her makeup still remains intact,</i></font>

56
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but her face and hands are filthy.</i></font>

57
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But this is probably grime 
from being handled.</i></font>

58
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The hostess's daughter must have 
taken this doll with her everywhere.</i></font>

59
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I've never taken care of 
a traditional doll before,</font>

60
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm not sure if it will live up 
to your expectations or not,</font>
