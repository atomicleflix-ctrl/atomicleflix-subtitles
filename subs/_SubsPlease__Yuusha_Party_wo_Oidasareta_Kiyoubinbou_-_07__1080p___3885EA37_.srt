00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what happened?</font>

6
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were suddenly transported 
out of the dungeon!</font>

7
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,630

22

30
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's clear that Orhun was the 
one who beat the Black Dragon.</font>

32
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you accept your

33

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Damn it!</i></font>

40
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My report on the expedition's going 
to be about nothing but Orhun!</font>

41
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He gave me courage,</font>

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and helped me cast my 
first advanced spell.</font>

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He taught me about 
Parallel Construction...</font>

44
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And...</font>

45
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He defeated the infamous 
Black Dragon all by himself!</font>

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He saved my life again...</font>

47
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was so cool when he fought.</font>

48
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He always has such a 
kind expression, too...</font>

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that what they call a gap?</font>

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back...</font>

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sister, welcome... home...</font>

52
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her face is a mess.</i></font>

53
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's been forever since 
I've seen her this tired.</i></font>

54
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least take a shower before bed.</font>

55
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later...</font>

56
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go to the baths together, then!</font>

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to take a bath 
when you're tired, huh?</font>

58
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Sophia!</font>

59
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad you were safe today.</font>

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was thanks to Orhun.</font>

61
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was so cool today, huh?</font>

62
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Sophia.</font>

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did the fight between Orhun 
and the Black Dragon feel to you?</font>

64
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Well, he was really strong.</font>

65
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's the normal reaction.</font>

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's so much more powerful than us 
that I can't even understand him.</font>

67
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understood him.</font>

68
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

69
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me what you understood!</font>

70
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Calm down, S-Sister!</font>

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry...</font>

72
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His movements and magic were amazing,</font>

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I think the rest was all just basics.</font>

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basics?</font>

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was exactly what he taught us about 
how rear attackers and defenders fight.</font>

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I learned a lot!</font>

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's amazing that he can do 
all that by himself, huh?</font>

79
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought that I could never understand</i></font>

80
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the bottomless well of strength 
I saw in Orhun's fighting,</i></font>

81
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but Sophia was different.</i></font>

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She understood what she 
saw in her own way.</i></font>

83
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're amazing, Sophia.</font>

84
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not...</font>

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true.</font>

86
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're way more amazing, Sister!</font>

87
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia...</font>

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I respect you the most of all.</font>

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You walk on your own two feet.</font>

90
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so cool and a lot 
of people rely on you!</font>

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to be like you!</font>

92
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But don't push yourself too hard, Sis!</font>

93
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow...</font>

94
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Relieve Pain!</font>

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My whole body aches...</font>

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess it's close to noon.</font>

97
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I pushed myself to my limits 
yesterday, after all.</font>

98
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm lucky there are no bad aftereffects 
after all that magic I used.</font>

99
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma?</font>

100
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry to bother you today.</font>

101
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are you feeling?</font>

102
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you can see, I'm fine.</font>

103
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for coming all this way.</font>

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finished the teaching expedition 
with no casualties, thanks to you.</font>

105
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have our thanks.</font>

106
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop bowing!</font>

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somebody like you shouldn't be...</font>

108
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My position isn't what's important.</font>

109
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You saved me, and our new recruits.</font>

110
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I cannot thank you enough.</font>

111
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selma...</font>

112
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually...</font>

113
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you come to our clan right now?</font>

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our leader wants to meet you.</font>

115
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. I'm not doing anything today.</font>

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make this quick.</font>

117
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to join the 
Night Sky Silver Rabbits?</font>

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We want you to serve 
as a front-line attacker</font>

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for Unit 1, 
our clan's most powerful party.</font>

120
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I want to recommend you 
as a lieutenant of our clan.</font>

121
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lieutenant?</font>

122
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm far too young...</font>

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got more than enough 
experience and power.</font>

124
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're educated, 
serious, and a hard worker.</font>

125
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have what it takes to 
be one of our lieutenants.</font>

126
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You agree, right, Selma?</font>

127
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

128
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would like to work with 
you to support our clan.</font>

129
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Normally, anybody would jump 
at an offer like this, but...</i></font>

130
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

131
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you give me some time?</font>

132
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. Take your time.</font>

133
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

134
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take my leave, then.</font>

135
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, and the Adventurer's 
Guild wants to see you.</font>

136
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right. I'll head there.</font>

137
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't believe the Night Sky Silver 
Rabbits want to recruit me...</i></font>

138
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So I'd have comrades, again?</i></font>

139
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that funny, Old Man.</font>

140
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

141
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always seem like such a grown-up.</font>

142
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nice to see you 
acting your age for once.</font>

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm serious about this, you know.</font>

144
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true that they seem 
to think highly of me.</font>

145
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

146
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might end up used 
and thrown away, again.</font>

147
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

148
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Used" may not be a nice word,</font>

149
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I think that supporting each other</font>

150
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and making up for our weaknesses 
is how people grow.</font>

151
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree. But...</font>

152
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think about it some more, then.</font>

153
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came at the worst time...</font>

154
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the Black Dragon appeared on Floor 50,</font>

155
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you defeated it alone, I'm told.</font>

156
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, that's true.</font>

157
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Alone? Nah.</font>

158
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd already weakened it, and you were 
lucky enough to land the killing blow.</font>

159
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucky for you. We saved your life.</font>

160
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up. You're not a part of this.</font>

161
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

162
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Derick.</font>

163
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guild master, if I may?</font>

164
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oliver, why did you head straight 
to Floor 92 with your new Enchanter?</font>

165
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you think it would be easy because 
you'd been there so many times before?</font>

166
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm right, huh?</font>

167
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you numerous times</font>

168
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that it was dangerous to go ahead
before you got stronger.</font>

169
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There were a lot of times in the deep 
floors where someone almost died.</font>

170
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why we got a new Enchanter.</font>

171
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With someone whose support magic 
was more powerful than yours,</font>

172
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I assumed we could go deeper.</font>

173
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why you fired me.</font>

174
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That, I'm not mad about.</font>

175
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What makes me mad is how little 
you seem to think of Enchanters.</font>

176
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know exactly how much they're worth!</font>

177
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An Enchanter's important, 
which is why I got a new one!</font>

178
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why did you start 
with the deep floors?</font>

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know how much
concentration it takes</font>

180
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for an Enchanter when
they're dungeon-delving?</font>

181
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All an Enchanter has to 
do is sit where it's safe</font>

182
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and cast another buff when 
the first one runs out.</font>

183
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's simple!</font>

184
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you serious?</font>

185
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I am. It's the truth!</font>

186
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you.</font>

187
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oliver, 61 seconds.</font>

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anneli, 134 seconds.</font>

189
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Derick, 186 seconds.</font>

190
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how long each of your buffs last.</font>

191
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An Enchanter has to keep track of 
all those to refresh the buffs,</font>

192
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and also give commands 
to the rest of the party.</font>

193
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How is that easy? Tell me, Oliver!</font>

194
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia, did you hear anything 
about what Orhun will do next?</font>

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, nothing.</font>

196
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We never did get a chance 
to talk to him yesterday.</font>

197
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think he'll join the 
Night Sky Silver Rabbits?</font>

198
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You feel the same, huh?</font>

199
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were just saying that!</font>

200
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Sophia?</font>

201
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah.</font>

202
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why don't we ask him together?</font>

203
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great idea!</font>

204
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But where is he?</font>

205
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My sister might know!</font>

206
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun Dura...</font>

207
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to have him join us.</font>

208
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But is he ever going 
to want comrades again?</font>

209
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He can get by without them.</i></font>

210
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And...</i></font>

211
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My magic won't work?</font>

212
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need your buffs!</font>

213
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll throw me off 
from what I'm used to!</font>

214
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He doesn't need my help.</i></font>

215
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's someone far, far more 
powerful than I am right now.</i></font>

216
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I told him I'd like to 
"work with him to support the clan," huh?</i></font>

217
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sister!</font>

218
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, Sophia?</font>

219
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know where Orhun lives?</font>

220
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to meet with him and 
ask him to join the Rabbits!</font>

221
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you serious?</font>

222
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want him to join, too, but...</font>

223
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But with his power, he doesn't need us.</font>

224
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, at our level, 
we'll just slow him down.</font>

225
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know that.</font>

226
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I want him to join us anyway!</font>

227
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just being with him will show me 
what I need to learn, I think!</font>

228
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

229
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fun because when he teaches 
you, you can get a lot stronger!</font>

230
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:16,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'd love to have him with us more...</font>

231
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys...</font>

232
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, we may be 
slowing him down, yes.</font>

233
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But someday we'll get stronger</font>

234
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and make him recognize us as comrades!</font>

235
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right.</i></font>

236
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can just learn from 
him and get stronger!</i></font>

237
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It looks like I was thinking 
about it too much.</i></font>

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He went to the Adventurer's 
Guild. If you hurry...</font>

239
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it! Thanks!</font>

240
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

241
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go!</font>

242
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So now they're going to talk about the 
penalty for the force teleportation, huh?</i></font>

243
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sucks to be them, I guess.</i></font>

244
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel tired.</font>

245
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that them?</font>

246
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are they doing here?</font>

247
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's him!</font>

248
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun!</font>

249
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mister!</font>

250
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it...</font>

251
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The damage from yesterday 
is catching up with me.</font>

252
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why am I even running?</font>

253
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun?</font>

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We want to talk!</font>

255
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are you?</font>

256
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way!</font>

257
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

258
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun!</font>

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun!</font>

260
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd he go?</font>

261
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's look that way!</font>

262
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

263
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun!</font>

264
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whew.</font>

265
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

266
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's not here.</font>

267
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's strange.</font>

268
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know he went this way...</font>

269
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you avoiding them?</font>

270
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I decided I wasn't going 
to join another party.</font>

271
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that would make them sad.</font>

272
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're avoiding them?</font>

273
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like they matter a lot to you.</font>

274
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's odd.</font>

275
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is he avoiding us?</font>

276
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe he doesn't want to join 
the Night Sky Silver Rabbits.</font>

277
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why we're all 
going to ask him, right?</font>

278
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But what if he actually says no?</font>

279
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll quit the Rabbits 
and become his apprentice!</font>

280
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No fair! Me too, then!</font>

281
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And of course, Sophia will too, right?</font>

282
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

283
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to say goodbye to him.</font>

284
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They seem to look up to you a lot.</font>

285
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it, Old Man.</font>

286
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

287
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you ran in here, you looked 
like you were kind of enjoying it.</font>

288
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you're looking 
for a place to belong.</font>

289
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I think that you 
don't have to be alone.</font>

290
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can find your place alongside others.</font>

291
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Where I belong?</i></font>

292
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Orhun?</font>

293
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia!</font>

294
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, thank you for saving us yesterday!</font>

295
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, no...</font>

296
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been looking for you all day!</font>

297
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where have you been?</font>

298
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... I've been going around town.</font>

299
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing out here at this hour?</font>

300
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's close to our clan HQ.</font>

301
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's one of my favorite spots.</font>

302
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Favorite spots?</font>

303
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

304
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The moon here is beautiful.</font>

305
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know how even when it's totally dark,</font>

306
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the moon still shines bright?</font>

307
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I feel like when I look at 
the moon, it gives me strength.</font>

308
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know where the name of the 
Night Sky Silver Rabbits comes from?</font>

309
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

310
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The moon is also called 
"the guide of the night."</font>

311
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And...</font>

312
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Night Sky Silver Rabbits want 
to be a guide for adventurers.</font>

313
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's where the name comes from.</font>

314
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A guide...</i></font>

315
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I talked with someone about that, once...</i></font>

316
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um... Orhun!</font>

317
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you please join the 
Night Sky Silver Rabbits?!</font>

318
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to stay with you!</font>

319
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Sophia.</font>

320
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of place is the 
Night Sky Silver Rabbits to you?</font>

321
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">T-To me?</font>

322
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

323
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

324
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've taught me so many things,</font>

325
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">given me so many smiles...</font>

326
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can be proud to say that it's my home!</font>

327
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To me, it's the place where I belong!</font>

328
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The place where you belong...</font>

329
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like you have your answer, then.</font>

330
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Vince...</font>

331
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Leader.</font>

332
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please let me join the 
Night Sky Silver Rabbits.</font>

333
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're glad to have you.</font>

334
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations, Orhun!</font>

335
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's your guild uniform!</font>

336
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try it on!</font>

337
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia, is that true?</font>

338
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hooray!</font>

340
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From now on, I'm a part of 
the Night Sky Silver Rabbits.</font>

341
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I look forward to working with you.</font>
