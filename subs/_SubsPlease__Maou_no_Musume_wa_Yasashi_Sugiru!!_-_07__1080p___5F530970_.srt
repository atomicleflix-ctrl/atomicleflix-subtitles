<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. There were once ancient

 be a bit more dramatic about it.</font>

78
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we'd probably cause her trouble

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,730

81
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she'll see how ugly we

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's best that we're just alone.</font>

83
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because of that... we should 
probably bow out now, Little Bro.</font>

84
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. More importantly, 
what's Doux doing?</font>

85
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux is practicing scary faces! Rawr!</font>

86
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah. You mentioned that 
you wanted to be scary.</font>

87
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you wanna be scary?</font>

88
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux wants to be a full-fledged demon.</font>

89
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm not really good at doing bad

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what trials I give her, 
there's been no change in Lady Doux.</font>

91
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she'd at least try 
to look or act scary...</font>

92
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she might actually change.</font>

93
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I've been trying to make my face scary.</font>

94
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Doux isn't very good at that either.</font>

95
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone's got something they can't do.</font>

96
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got tons.</font>

97
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just keep practicing so that 
you'll be able to pull it off someday.</font>

98
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then who knows? 
Maybe it'll actually happen.</font>

99
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay! I will!</font>

100
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who would've thought a little kid 
would be so worried about something?</font>

101
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Little Bro?</font>

102
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm actually really 
worried right now, too.</font>

103
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Little Bro?!</font>

104
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I realized something when 
we were playing with Doux.</font>

105
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been fun being with 
just you, Big Bro,</font>

106
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it's even more fun with 
the three of us together!</font>

107
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that means it'd be even more 
fun if we were with even more people.</font>

108
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gauche, you...</font>

109
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Then let's go play with everyone!</font>

110
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's lots of humans and 
demons who live in the castle.</font>

111
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we all play together,
it'll be even more fun!</font>

112
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We can't do that.</font>

113
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone'll just be scared of us.</font>

114
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

115
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because we're so hard to look at.</font>

116
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're easy to look at though.</font>

117
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

118
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, look how big you are, 
Big Brother Gauche!</font>

119
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd be easy to find
if we played hide-and-seek!</font>

120
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux?</font>

121
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

122
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,970

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah... you're right!</font>

135
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Save us!</font>

136
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So scary!</font>

137
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Urun! Mr. Gauche!</font>

138
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We got to be scary!</font>

139
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, yup. You guys were pretty scary.</font>

140
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Big Bro?</font>

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, how about... <i>this</i> next?!</font>

142
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

143
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like this, Mr. Urun?!</font>

144
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Very good, very good!</font>

145
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll do the next one.</font>

146
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One more time!</font>

147
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Jahi!</font>

148
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only was she not in any danger,</font>

149
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but she even befriended 
the Monsters of Terror!</font>

150
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps Lady Doux is already 
amazing just as she is.</font>

151
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thunder, eh?</font>

152
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thunder... Oh, that reminds me.</font>

153
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear that on stormy nights 
with thunder and lightning,</font>

154
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a wailing ghost appears?</font>

155
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?!</font>

156
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've already got Monsters of Terror. 
Why'd something like that appear, too?</font>

157
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph. How stupid.</font>

158
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Something's definitely wailing, all right!</i></font>

159
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>C-C-Calm down. Who's scared of any ghost?</i></font>

160
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll make them regret it!</i></font>

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big Sister Jahi!</font>

162
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

163
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux. Is the thunder...</font>

164
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodness. What a fussy little ghost.</font>

165
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly.</font>

166
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're completely fine with the Monsters 
of Terror but scared of thunder.</font>

167
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess you really are still just a child.</font>

168
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodnight.</font>

169
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THE SPIRIT TOWER IS JUST TOO EXCITING!!</font>

170
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"The Spirit Tower Is Just Too Exciting!!"</i></font>

171
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, Jahi, how are Doux's trials going?</font>

172
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm terribly sorry.</font>

173
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I'm so inadequate...</font>

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you're stuck, 
there's always another path.</font>

175
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty?</font>

176
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jahi, I hereby give you a new mission.</font>

177
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A new mission?</font>

178
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a very important mission 
that I cannot trust to any other.</font>

179
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will be beneficial as you 
continue to give Doux her trials.</font>

180
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You honor me, Your Majesty.</font>

181
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I, Jahi, will see this mission through 
even at the cost of my own life.</font>

182
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Papa! I put this on all by myself!</font>

183
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, Doux!</font>

184
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look. If you just fix 
this part, it's perfect!</font>

185
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

186
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks wonderful on... wait!</font>

187
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came here because you said 
this mission was important,</font>

188
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but this is just a vacation!</font>

189
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be so naïve, Jahi!</font>

190
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the Spirit Tower.</font>

191
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Spirit Tower?</font>

192
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

193
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a giant ryokan that lies in the 
middle of dimensions where not only demons</font>

194
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but beings from various
 worlds come to visit.</font>

195
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Other worlds...</font>

196
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there any danger like the pishacha 
that once controlled Salamandra?</font>

197
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But of course.</font>

198
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quarrels at the Spirit 
Tower are forbidden.</font>

199
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meaning this is the perfect place to 
find out more about all of the people</font>

200
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we will eventually conquer.</font>

201
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So our true motive
 is reconnaissance.</font>

202
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, very good, Doux.</font>

203
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see, here. Papa will join in, too.</font>

204
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, how fun this is!</font>

205
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Papa! Everyone's watching real hard!</font>

206
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jahi.</font>

207
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today, we will act as a visiting
family and have tons of fun!</font>

208
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tons of fun!</font>

209
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, Jahi? Where'd you go?</font>

210
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd you go?</font>

211
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This family is hopeless...</i></font>

212
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No... I need to pull myself together.</i></font>

213
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>First, I will investigate the 
patrons from the demon world.</i></font>

214
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dance with us, Jahi!</font>

215
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dance!</font>

216
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this?</font>

217
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something fun going on?</font>

218
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna see!</font>

219
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Your Majesty! Lady Doux!</font>

220
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care of Doux!</font>

221
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood! Lady Doux! 
I'm heading to you now!</font>

222
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux! Lady Doux!</font>

223
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux!</font>

224
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux! Are you hurt?</font>

225
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux!</font>

226
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Papa and Big Sister Jahi are gone.</font>

227
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do they look like?</font>

228
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Papa...</font>

229
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

230
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dropped this!</font>

231
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Missy?!</font>

232
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, thank goodness. Thank you so much!</font>

233
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're welcome!</font>

234
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, I've gotta thank you.</font>

235
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have anything you wish for?</font>

236
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see... Papa and Big Sister Jahi...</font>

237
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah! He's all shaky!</font>

238
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh? Wait! I still haven't thanked you!</font>

239
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a huge help.</font>

240
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay!</font>

241
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pain, pain, fly away!</font>

242
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My bad back's better in an instant!</font>

243
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much!</font>

244
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mom, I wanna eat that!</font>

245
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to pee!</font>

246
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute! How long is my husband
going to take in the bathroom?!</font>

247
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help you!</font>

248
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

249
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh my. Look at you, in a good 
mood because Doux played with you.</font>

250
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much, Doux.</font>

251
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really helped me out. See you later.</font>

252
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye-bye!</font>

253
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you are!</font>

254
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux!</font>

255
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big Sister Jahi!</font>

256
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where have you been, Lady Doux?!</font>

257
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you've been doing 
kind things everywhere!</font>

258
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this rate, you'll never be 
a full-fledged demon... huh?</font>

259
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Lady Doux?</font>

260
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... a lot of people showed up, 
and then you and Papa were gone.</font>

261
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I kept wanting to 
ask people where you went,</font>

262
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they were all in trouble...</font>

263
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I was helping them and...</font>

264
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-All right. Please calm down!</font>

265
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First of all... I'm just 
glad you're safe, Lady Doux.</font>

266
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go find His Majesty.</font>

267
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure you hold onto my hand 
this time so we don't lose you.</font>

268
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Kay!</font>

269
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the meaning of this, Your Majesty?</font>

270
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I happened to get along 
with this group of guests.</font>

271
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat and drink as much as you'd like!</font>

272
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

273
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

274
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The food here is exquisite!</font>

275
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux, let me make your plate for you.</font>

276
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Kay!</font>

277
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hup, hup, huppity hup!</font>

278
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay! You're amazing, Papa!</font>

279
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey there, hottie. Come over 
here and have a drink with me.</font>

280
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't try to get ahead, you pervy kappa!</font>

281
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Who're you callin' bald?!</font>

282
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never said that!</font>

283
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're always callin' me bald!</font>

284
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not bald! I just 
have a plate on my head!</font>

285
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow! You're so good, Big Sister!</font>

286
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is how you do it, Lady Doux.</font>

287
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like this?</font>

288
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Make sure they don't cross.</font>

289
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it! I did it!</font>

290
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll share some with you, too, Big Sister!</font>

291
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

292
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This food is so squishy and fun.</font>

293
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what it tastes like.</font>

294
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The water feels great. 
I'm being warmed up to my core.</font>

295
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! We're just enjoying 
ourselves after all!</font>

296
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back!</font>

297
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How was it, Jahi?</font>

298
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you enjoy your bath?</font>

299
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

300
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I forgot my mission and acted 
disgracefully. I'm so ashamed.</font>

301
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mission?</font>

302
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, don't worry about that!
 That comes second!</font>

303
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

304
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured you wouldn't tag 
along unless I said that.</font>

305
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Initially, I was planning for this to 
be a family trip for just Doux and I,</font>

306
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but she insisted that 
you come along as well.</font>

307
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But why me?</font>

308
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's because you're my 
big sister, Big Sister Jahi.</font>

309
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux...</font>

310
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, there you have it!</font>

311
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get to also enjoy 
yourself on our family trip!</font>

312
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Majesty... You're becoming 
more and more like Lady Doux.</font>

313
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! I am?!</font>

314
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't be so happy about that.</font>

315
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ooh. It looks like it's started...</font>

316
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Spirit Tower's famous 
fireworks display.</font>

317
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big Sister, come sit with me!</font>

318
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I...</font>

319
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't this fun?</font>

320
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

321
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's not so bad.</font>

322
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THE DEMON KING'S ATTENDANT THINKS TOO MUCH!!</font>

323

324
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,410

325
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought about this at the hot springs,</font>

326
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but having long hair just gets in the way.</font>

327
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now...</font>

328
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ooh, changing up your look?</font>

329
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you fall in love?</font>

330
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you fall for an ogre since 
you're a meathead attendant?</font>

331
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or maybe a cyclops is more your type?</font>

332
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There'd be nothing more shameful than if 
she were to accuse me of such non-truths!</font>

333
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know! I'll just cut it short!</font>

334
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a proper hairstyle 
for my attendant!</font>

335
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he says that, I won't 
be able to take it back!</font>

336
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I tie up?</font>

337
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or cut it short?</font>

338
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tie it up?</font>

339
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cut it short?</font>

340
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,670

343
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,750

345
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,930
