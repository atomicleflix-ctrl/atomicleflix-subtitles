3
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess there are cities 
on the Northern Plateau.</font>

4
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are a lot of bars here.</font>

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This area's the only grain-producing

6
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's always had plenty of breweries.</font>

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh.</font>

8
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was talking to Old Man Fass.</font>

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said he's almost found Boshaft.</font>

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

11
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}He's been talking about that 
since my grandpa was a kid.</font>

12
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's Boshaft?</font>

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard about it from Mr. Heiter.</font>

14
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Long ago, most of the continent was 
ruled by a single great empire.</font>

15
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was an exquisite liquor 
offered to the emperor.</font>

16
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh.</font>

17
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He would lament about how, because of 
Ms. Frieren, he never got to drink it.</font>

18
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was a reason for that.</font>

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to stay here for long.</font>

20
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once we're finished shopping—</font>

21
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren!</font>

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's you, Frieren!</font>

23
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't seen you in a century.</font>

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been eighty years, Fass.</font>

25
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a stickler for details now? 
How unlike you.</font>

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your roster's changed.</font>

27
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That young guy who liked 
to drink isn't with you?</font>

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heiter's dead.</font>

29
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He went peacefully.</font>

30
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I was too late.</font>

31
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've located Boshaft, 
the Emperor's Spirits.</font>

32
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you help me?</font>

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can use magic, right?</font>

34
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does magic have to do with Boshaft?</font>

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with me, and you'll see.</font>

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's in here.</font>

37
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this... a mine?</font>

38
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dug it all by myself.</font>

39
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most people think all dwarves are miners,</font>

40
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I grew up in the city.</font>

41
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to study mining from scratch.</font>

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it for that legendary liquor.</font>

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is this old guy?</font>

44
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fass. No one loves liquor as much as him.</font>

45
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's spent over two hundred years 
looking for Boshaft.</font>

46
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He asked us for help 
the last time we met,</font>

47
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we had a Demon King to defeat 
at the time, so we said no.</font>

48
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Boshaft!</font>

49
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Let go!</font>

50
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pulling Heiter away was no mean feat.</font>

51
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you digging a mine 
to find liquor?</font>

52
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:36,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to legend, there's Boshaft 
stored in the ruins underground here.</font>

53
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And two hundred years ago,</font>

54
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when I found this stone monument, 
I knew it was true.</font>

55
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is ancient elvish.</font>

56
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The inscription proclaims that Boshaft is 
the greatest liquor to have ever existed.</font>

57
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Milliarde."</font>

58
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps that's who wrote 
this inscription.</font>

59
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're well-educated if you can 
read ancient elvish at your age.</font>

60
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren drilled it into me 
when I was young.</font>

61
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Most grimoires are written 
in ancient elvish.</font>

62
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll have to learn to read it.</font>

63
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it was Milliarde.</font>

64
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ever since discovering this inscription, 
I've dedicated my life to finding Boshaft.</font>

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And now, it's almost within my grasp.</font>

66
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You found the ruins?</font>

67
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ruins themselves, yes.</font>

68
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But as you can see, the doors to 
this stone chamber won't open.</font>

69
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A powerful barrier was erected 
to preserve the liquor.</font>

70
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be able to break it, though.</font>

71
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't.</font>

72
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely you can.</font>

73
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll take time to remove.</font>

74
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those kids wouldn't be happy about that.</font>

75
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make it worth your while.</font>

76
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With a grimoire?</font>

77
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Money! I'll pay you twenty 
Reich gold coins.</font>

78
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not even worth considering.</font>

79
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, Frieren!</font>

80
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my dream to drink Boshaft!</font>

81
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been searching for 
over two hundred years!</font>

82
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, perhaps we could help him.</font>

84
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I feel sorry for Old Man Fass.</font>

85
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this about? 
You're giving me the creeps.</font>

86
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Normally, you'd be opposed 
to this sort of thing.</font>

87
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, he's offering twenty gold 
coins. We can use that on our journey.</font>

88
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a ton of money.</font>

89
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't have to worry about 
living expenses for a while.</font>

90
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the barrier will take 
three months to remove.</font>

92
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's hardly any time at all.</font>

93
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

94
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll do it.</font>

95
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't come crying to me later.</font>

96
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in the final stages 
of removing the barrier.</font>

97
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should be able to finish tomorrow.</font>

98
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't look very pleased.</font>

99
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess not.</font>

100
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boshaft doesn't taste good.</font>

101
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not worth devoting your life to.</font>

102
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the inscription said...</font>

103
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some elves pass the time 
in ways you wouldn't believe.</font>

104
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milliarde, you never do anything. 
You just gaze off into space.</font>

105
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Many of our fellow elves spend their 
long lives searching for something.</font>

106
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think that is?</font>

107
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

108
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that they don't end up like me.</font>

109
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, could you imagine the thing 
you spent your life searching for</font>

110
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">turning out to be worthless garbage?</font>

111
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. What are you talking about?</font>

112
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My distant past.</font>

113
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This liquor really is terrible.</font>

114
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boshaft.</font>

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the awful, cheap liquor 
they served at the coronation.</font>

116
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before coming to this village, 
I carved an inscription to pass the time.</font>

117
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It says, "Boshaft is the greatest 
liquor to have ever existed."</font>

118
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was the point of that?</font>

119
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was no point at all.</font>

120
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's finally time.</font>

121
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's well-preserved.</font>

122
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never thought I'd get to taste this.</font>

123
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's toast. Drink with me.</font>

124
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is...</font>

125
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Frieren, why did you decline 
to search for Boshaft?</i></font>

126
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heiter, you like liquor, right?</font>

127
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I do.</font>

128
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen to this corrupt priest.</font>

129
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you do if the liquor 
you spent your life searching for</font>

130
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">turned out to be unbelievably terrible?</font>

131
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

132
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I'd laugh it off.</font>

133
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It tastes bad, right? Then it's 
best enjoyed with friends.</font>

134
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so...</font>

135
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's terrible.</font>

136
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the worst-tasting drink 
I've ever had.</font>

137
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you just watching? Try it, Stark.</font>

138
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? No way. It's terrible, right?</font>

139
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just try it.</font>

140
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's freaking gross!</font>

141
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is it so gross?</font>

142
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is terrible.</font>

143
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Try it.</font>

144
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's plenty to go around!</font>

145
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make the whole city suffer with me!</font>

146
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren.</font>

147
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My search ended in disappointment, 
but I've never had such a fun night.</font>

148
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you guys were here.</font>

149
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liquor's meant to be 
enjoyed with good times.</font>

150
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,030
<font face="Times New Roman">{\an7}<font color="#f7fffa">Episode 33: Logistics in the Northern Plateau</font></font>

151
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,030
<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><b>{\an9}30 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in Norm Company territory, located on the Northern Plateau</b></font>

152
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's your share of bread, Mr. Stark.</font>

153
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear that? 
This bread just went "clunk."</font>

154
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a sound food should make.</font>

155
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been eating rock-hard 
bread this whole week.</font>

156
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't complain.</font>

157
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Northern Plateau is barren outside 
of the grain-producing Bier region,</font>

158
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and goods aren't even circulating now.</font>

159
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be eating mostly this while 
we camp, at the very least.</font>

160
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's so sad.</font>

161
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we walk another half day, 
we should be able to get a decent meal.</font>

162
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's an impressive fortress city.</font>

163
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the Norm Company's estate.</font>

164
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That structure in the center 
is their headquarters.</font>

165
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They deal in various goods, 
primarily wheat from the Bier region.</font>

166
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're an armed trading company 
with the logistics network</font>

167
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and military force to supply the villages 
dotted across the Northern Plateau.</font>

168
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not even the state can touch them.</font>

169
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For all intents and purposes, they rule 
humanity on the Northern Plateau.</font>

170
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Ms. Frieren, you said earlier 
that goods aren't circulating.</font>

171
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the problem.</font>

172
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know the specific cause, 
but things change over time.</font>

173
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe the Norm Company 
isn't as strong as it once was.</font>

174
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's likely that they still have a lot
of influence on the Northern Plateau.</font>

175
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should avoid making waves.</font>

176
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

177
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're Ms. Fern, a first-class mage.</font>

178
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may pass.</font>

179
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That person...</font>

180
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One moment, please.</font>

181
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what's going on.</font>

182
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Norm, the company president.</font>

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, mage of the party of heroes,</font>

184
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you will be paying off the debt 
you've owed for eighty years in full.</font>

185
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren, you've been carrying debt?</font>

186
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just a little.</font>

187
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?</font>

188
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I was told I could 
pay it back anytime.</font>

189
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what the documents say.</font>

190
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Verbal agreements are no good.</font>

191
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems my predecessor's predecessor 
was lax in that area, but I am not.</font>

192
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Three Strahl gold, twenty Reich gold, 
and various silvers and coppers.</font>

193
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're as wealthy as a minor noble.</font>

194
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

195
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your grandfather did us a favor, 
so you can keep the change.</font>

196
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

197
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't nearly enough.</font>

198
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, I have to work in the mines 
for three hundred years.</font>

199
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My journey ends here.</font>

200
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about, Ms. Frieren?</font>

201
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you dressed like that? 
Where's your bag?</font>

202
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They took everything as collateral.</font>

203
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye, Fern and Stark.</font>

204
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care.</font>

205
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

206
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are we going to do?</font>

207
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All we can do is buy back Ms. Frieren.</font>

208
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's not a thing, you know.</font>

209
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unfortunately, there's nothing 
you can do about it.</font>

210
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look.</font>

211
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to the documents,</font>

212
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she owes over five hundred Strahl 
gold coins including interest.</font>

213
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even when converted to Reich gold coins,</font>

214
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the most trusted currency on the Northern 
Plateau, she owes over three hundred.</font>

215
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think you can procure such a sum?</font>

216
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that would be impossible.</font>

217
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously, what are we going to do?</font>

218
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't wait three hundred years.</font>

219
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really like mines.</font>

220
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're hot and dusty.</font>

221
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The president told us 
about you, Ms. Frieren.</font>

222
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

223
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we get started, then?</font>

224
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll go straight through here.</font>

225
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're certain?</font>

226
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do you think I am?</font>

227
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, boys! Start digging!</font>

228
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

229
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Norm Company president 
of two generations ago</font>

230
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">started out as a backwater noble 
cast out to the Northern Plateau.</font>

231
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a great man who invested in this 
barren land and built a logistics network,</font>

232
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">bringing stability to people's lives.</font>

233
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the time, nobody expected 
much from our party of heroes,</font>

234
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he provided us with funds 
with no repayment deadline.</font>

235
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never thought I'd be treated 
like this by his grandson.</font>

236
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there must be a reason you came 
all the way to this mine, right?</font>

237
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Logistics in the Northern Plateau 
are in a terrible state, aren't they?</font>

238
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose.</font>

239
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even my companions complained that 
they'd never eaten such hard bread.</font>

240
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure they hadn't. 
I'm not fond of it either.</font>

241
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since conditions have worsened here,</font>

242
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we've lost a third of our armed 
caravans and army fighting demons.</font>

243
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our logistics network is in ruins, too.</font>

244
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the Norm Company were a nation, 
we'd have fallen already.</font>

245
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, we are a trading company.</font>

246
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as we have the funds, 
we can always rebuild.</font>

247
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you arrived in this region, I felt 
the Goddess must've brought you here.</font>

248
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That scrap of paper representing your 
party's debt gained tremendous value.</font>

249
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This mine is still under development.</font>

250
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we strike silver ore, 
we'll turn a huge profit.</font>

251
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough to forgive the party 
of heroes' debt and more.</font>

252
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It should be easy for you 
to find, Ms. Frieren.</font>

253
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So you're using that 
scrap of paper to coerce me.</font>

254
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If our logistics network falls apart 
entirely, many people will starve and die.</font>

255
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please save the people of the 
Northern Plateau, Ms. Frieren.</font>

256
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, if you help us, you'll 
have soft bread to eat</font>

257
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even in the farthest reaches 
of the Northern Plateau.</font>

258
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're as shrewd as your grandfather.</font>

259
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is why I can't stand merchants.</font>

260
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. You have a deal.</font>

261
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, I intended to repay 
the debt I owed your grandfather.</font>

262
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe we 
actually struck silver.</font>

263
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back. Shall we go?</font>

264
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good. We were discussing 
how to save you.</font>

265
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were planning to raid the mine tonight.</font>
