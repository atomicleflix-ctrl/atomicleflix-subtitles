1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I got a chance to meet you.</font>

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knew the money moving around 
the crown princess was so fishy?</font>

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see why you're comptroller 
of the treasury, assistant or not.</font>

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, I'm in your debt for all 
you've been so good as to tell me.</font>

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope I'll be seeing more
 of you, Rufus May.</font>

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well?</font>

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you suspected, it would appear...</font>

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Aldous Clayton is on his way 
to interview her.</font>

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My mistress's room is 
at the end of the hall.</font>

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've made certain you'll have privacy.</font>

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aisha Huxley...</font>

12
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What made her decide to confess 
a decade-old crime now?</font>

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but she isn't the quarry
 you're after, is she...</font>

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Deborah Darkian?</font>

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've made certain you'll have privacy.</i></font>

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn and blast!</font>

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you!</font>

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He took... the medicine bottle.</font>

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Salvador of Daeg Gallus...</font>

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must mean that man.</font>

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sharon... Investigate my cousin Sharon...</font>

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will. Anything else?</font>

23
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett...</font>

24
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think Scarlett will... forgive me?</font>

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure she will.</font>

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank good—</font>

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A guard dog's disgrace is 
his owner's responsibility, no?</font>

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-Murderer!</font>

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodbye...</font>

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abigail O'Brian.</font>

31
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}What's a wanted murderer doing here?!</font>

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somebody else killed her.
 I just got framed.</font>

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What an unbelievably stupid dog you are!</font>

34
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could have at least 
been smarter about it!</font>

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you, I didn't do it.</font>

36
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make excuses!</font>

37
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That attitude is why you slip up,
 you mangy stray!</font>

38
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen to me, you old hag!</font>

39
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, um, who might this be?</font>

40
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Lady Audrey, our teacher.</font>

41
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She teaches us how to do 
our makeup and pick out dresses.</font>

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how to wrap gentlemen 
around our fingers!</font>

43
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wrap them...?</font>

44
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you're darling.</font>

45
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right if you don't understand.</font>

46
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long do you intend
 to sit around chattering?!</font>

47
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why must everyone Abigail 
brings me be such utter...</font>

48
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does Abby have to do with it?</font>

49
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll have you know the former Duke O'Brian
 charged me with guarding this place.</font>

50
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll toss lazy layabouts out on their ear!</font>

51
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough, silly.</font>

52
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

53
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look on the bottom right.</font>

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Sharon Spencer, Aisha's cousin.</font>

55
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like she died on the same day.</font>

56
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say it was suicide, 
but I'll bet she was murdered.</font>

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daeg Gallus again...</font>

58
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They work fast.</font>

59
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There must be some secret 
they really don't want to come out.</font>

60
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon me.</font>

61
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Lordship?</font>

62
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My! Here to collect her again?</font>

63
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need you to listen calmly.</font>

64
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abigail has been arrested 
on suspicion of Aisha Huxley's murder.</font>

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was an anonymous tip.</font>

66
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:48,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It said the fugitive Aldous Clayton is
none other than Folkvangr's bouncer, Rudy,</font>

67
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that it was Abigail 
who provided him with his false identity.</font>

68
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abby...</font>

69
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's therefore being investigated
for masterminding Aisha's murder.</font>

70
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But Lady Abigail had 
nothing to do with Aisha!</font>

71
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abigail wrote to Aisha a week ago.</font>

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see to it that you receive
 an invitation from the Huxleys soon.</font>

73
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my fault...</font>

74
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Connie. You did nothing wrong.</font>

75
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to do something!</i></font>

76
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll turn myself in.</font>

77
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait a moment!</font>

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Move!</font>

79
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will not. Giving yourself up 
won't save Abby in your place.</font>

80
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what am I supposed to do?!</font>

81
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to think of something!</font>

82
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now! All of us together!</font>

83
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Connie.</font>

84
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It <i>is</i> true that we have 
our own way of doing things.</font>

85
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have an idea?</font>

86
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, isn't there something 
you forgot to say?</font>

87
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help me, Scarlett!</font>

88
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, very well.</font>

89
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall save you.</font>

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Naturally, since the charges are false,</font>

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they have no evidence 
to definitively prove Abigail's guilt.</font>

92
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our enemies will send a judge 
in their pocket for her trial.</font>

93
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Earl Kalvin Campbell 
is set to try the case.</font>

94
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In a word, he's a womanizer.</font>

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your quintessential scumbag 
who's fathered children all over.</font>

96
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A judge like that is bound 
to have dirty secrets.</font>

97
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

98
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We find out what they are first 
and blackmail him ourselves!</font>

99
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Blackmail?</font>

100
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

101
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">call courtesans to the Earl John Doe Ball
 for some drunken merrymaking!</font>

102
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Earl Campbell will leap at 
the novel entertainment! It's perfect!</font>

103
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one can think up 
tasteless spectacles quite like you.</font>

104
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

105
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an interesting plan.</font>

106
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give the signal if the worst happens.</font>

107
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll threaten him myself.</font>

108
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Connie.</font>

109
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For giving us a chance to repay Abby.</font>

110
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until a few years ago, Rebekah and I were 
forced to work somewhere truly awful.</font>

111
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was practically a prison.</font>

112
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if we'd escaped,
 we had nowhere to go.</font>

113
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They treated us like slaves.</font>

114
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then, along came Abby.</font>

115
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've bought every girl in this place.</font>

116
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let's get out of here.</font>

117
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how Abby rescued
 all of the girls working here.</font>

118
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

119
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, please, do whatever you can for her.</font>

120
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Oh, please raise your heads.</font>

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on now. Before Audrey catches on.</font>

122
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before who does what?</font>

123
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, Audrey...</font>

124
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Planning how to get out 
of work, are you?!</font>

125
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't recall teaching you that!</font>

126
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the problem with 
the lot of you Abigail brought in.</font>

127
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You hardly pass for
 decent funeral flowers.</font>

128
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abby isn't dead yet!</font>

129
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too soon for you to be so senile,
 you rotten old hag.</font>

130
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Rotten" is unfair. 
She's a perfectly respectable old hag.</font>

131
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, am I?!</font>

132
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see you girls are 
as foul-mouthed as ever.</font>

133
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Laura, go take down the sign.</font>

134
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't we have a big party to attend?</font>

135
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll close shop for tonight 
and focus on cultivating new clientele.</font>

136
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go make yourselves up! All of you!</font>

137
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Audrey...</font>

138
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What Abigail brings on herself 
is no business of mine.</font>

139
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when they strike at her, 
they pick a fight with Folkvangr.</font>

140
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen up, girls!</font>

141
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use every trick in the book
 to take this man for all he's worth.</font>

142
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't leave a solid bone in his body.</font>

143
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why?</i></font>

144
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I did my hair for today!
I had my mask specially made!</i></font>

145
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So why?!</i></font>

146
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why doesn't anyone choose me?!</i></font>

147
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's...</i></font>

148
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the pride of Folkvangr, 
Miriam the rose fairy!</i></font>

149
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My lady.</font>

150
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I beg your pardon.</font>

151
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's here with me.</font>

152
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She simply won't have 
anyone else. Excuse us.</font>

153
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i></i>I<i> lost to a man like </i>that<i>?!</i></font>

154
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?!</font>

155
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-My sincere apologies.</font>

156
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, dear me.</font>

157
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The beautiful moon has 
shrouded herself in clouds.</font>

158
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has something happened to sadden you so?</font>

159
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. At least, nothing I'd dare
 to speak of here.</font>

160
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Might I become the wind
 to blow your clouds away?</font>

161
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps you've heard that the owner 
of our establishment is under arrest.</font>

162
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I think that I may 
end up on the street,</font>

163
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I find myself overwhelmed with worry.</font>

164
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Does she mean Abigail O'Brian?</i></font>

165
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I thought it would be a boring job 
just delivering a predetermined verdict,</i></font>

166
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but what an unexpected perk.</i></font>

167
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When that time comes, call on me.</font>

168
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Kalvin Campbell. 
I promise you a comfortable life.</font>

169
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To tell the truth, I've received 
a similar offer from Viscount Hamsworth.</font>

170
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please excuse me.</font>

171
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's quite true.</font>

172
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you beast.</font>

173
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! I'll double his offer!</font>

174
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have all the money you could want!</font>

175
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true!</font>

176
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And may I ask... where?</font>

177
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ill-gotten funds?</font>

178
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He operates hospitals 
and orphanages, you know?</font>

179
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The country sponsors this, and he pockets
 some of the money on the sly.</font>

180
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry! The money's clean on paper.</font>

181
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I pool it in the secret accounts
of a citizen's group as "donations"!</font>

182
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're lucky he's so loose-lipped.</font>

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His tiny brain must be 
as loose as his pants.</font>

184
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, um, what citizens' group is this?</font>

185
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's called the Violet Association.</font>

186
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, what a coincidence.</font>

187
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Oh! That woman all in pink is...</font>

188
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kimberly Smith of the Violet Association.</font>

189
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And who might you be 
to take me aside so abruptly?</font>

190
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am called "Miss C."</font>

191
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, goodness me. What can I do for you?</font>

192
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is your relationship 
with Earl Kalvin Campbell?</font>

193
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The earl? He's a magnificent gentleman.</font>

194
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He sympathizes with our cause 
despite his aristocratic origins.</font>

195
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And donates to it?</font>

196
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How grim you look. 
Donating to a cause is hardly a crime.</font>

197
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, unless the money 
was obtained illegally.</font>

198
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

199
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear your association 
keeps secret accounts.</font>

200
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I take it she genuinely 
doesn't know about them.</font>

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me,</font>

202
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">did the earl tell you that?</font>

203
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. The rat is probably... 
in our youth committee, I suppose.</font>

204
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare he use a defenseless 
citizens' group as cover.</font>

205
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That Campbell boy has nerve, 
I'll give him that.</font>

206
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the by,</font>

207
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose you plan to blackmail him 
into acquitting Abigail?</font>

208
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To think a "sincere" Grail 
would fight fire with fire!</font>

209
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I can't say it's a bad plan.</font>

210
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're not quite up to the task.</font>

211
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. I owe you for telling me 
about the secret accounts,</font>

212
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so let me take it from here.</font>

213
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

214
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't want to see the O'Brians 
overthrown any more than you do.</font>

215
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We didn't spend ten years weakening the 
Darkians only to watch them rise again.</font>

216
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just who is this woman?</i></font>

217
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't trust me? 
Then I'll give you a little hint.</font>

218
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What color are violets?</font>

219
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Our country's violets 
have an unusual reddish hue.</i></font>

220
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It has come to represent the royal family 
because it matches their eyes.</i></font>

221
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The royals of Faris, on the other hand, 
have bluish-purple eyes.</i></font>

222
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In both Adelbide and Faris, 
these eye colors symbolize their royalty.</i></font>

223
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Which would suggest the Violet Association
that Kimberly belongs to is...</i></font>

224
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?</font>

225
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's almost time for the verdict.</font>

226
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think she'll be all right?</font>

227
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That depends on Kimberly Smith.</font>

228
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Abigail...</font>

229
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Grail?</font>

230
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Lordship!</font>

231
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did it go? 
What was the verdict?!</font>

232
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not guilty.</font>

233
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Due to insufficient evidence.</font>

234
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although...</font>

235
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the earl looked as if <i>he'd</i> been 
sentenced to death when he delivered it.</font>

236
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems that woman managed well enough.</font>

237
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abigail will be released as soon 
as the formalities are taken care of.</font>

238
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank goodness!</font>

239
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh no. I feel faint.</i></font>

240
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right?</font>

241
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So close...</i></font>

242
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's so, so, so close!</i></font>

243
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, his chest sure is firm...</i></font>

244
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, no! I mean, this is... I know! 
This is a kind of a rescue effort!</i></font>

245
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Certainly not a lover's embrace or...</i></font>

246
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your face is flushed.</font>

247
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have a fever or—</font>

248
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-N-Not at all! I'm quite well!</font>

249
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, yes. That's enough of that.</font>

250
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Abby!</font>

251
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... wasn't the least bit worried for you!</font>

252
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucia...</font>

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After that...</i></font>

254
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>once news of Lady Abigail's 
innocence spread,</i></font>

255
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the search for the true culprit
 led to the arrest of a suitable man,</i></font>

256
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>who confessed to Aisha's murder
and took his own life that evening.</i></font>

257
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Meanwhile,</i></font>

258
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>an accusation started doing the rounds.</i></font>

259
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It claimed someone had leaked information
about Aisha which had to her murder.</i></font>

260
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And that someone...</i></font>

261
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>was Amelia Hobbes.</i></font>

262
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crown Princess Cecilia!</font>

263
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who're you? And who are you 
calling "crown princess"?</font>

264
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't fool me.</font>

265
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Word has spread, and no publisher 
will give me the time of day now!</font>

266
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To make my comeback, 
I need a scandal that no one can deny!</font>

267
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need <i>what</i>?</font>

268
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cici.</font>

269
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Almost every other child 
in your old orphanage died in a fire.</font>

270
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only two remain unaccounted for.</font>

271
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and that boy, Cici—</font>

272
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cici is dead.</font>

273
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to die too?</font>

274
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then disappear from this country
 before the day is out.</font>

275
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't,</font>

276
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll dye that shabby red hair 
of yours a lovely crimson.</font>

277
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you racking 
your inadequate brain over?</font>

278
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're awful!</font>

279
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've told you, your face gives you away.</font>

280
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember what Abigail said?</font>

281
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Connie, you'd better watch out yourself.</font>

282
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was too smoothly done to be
 a cover-up of a decade-old crime.</font>

283
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something tells me there's yet 
a big secret we don't know.</font>

284
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daeg Gallus is hunting 
for Lady Lily's key.</font>

285
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So if we solve the mystery of that key 
and the phrase "the Holy Grail of Eris,"</font>

286
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it may give us a clue.</font>

287
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello there,</font>

288
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">charming young lady.</font>

289
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm looking for the Grand Merillian. 
Might I ask you the way?</font>

290
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Of course. It's just—</font>

291
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">San!</font>

292
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Eularia.</font>

293
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I looked everywhere for you! Honestly! 
You lose your way at the drop of a hat!</font>

294
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me? Surely it was you who lost your way.</font>

295
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, yes. I'm sure that's 
how it seems to <i>you</i>!</font>

296
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, please, at least carry a map.</font>

297
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See this?</font>

298
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You take the letters 
and number written here</font>

299
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and use them to...</font>

300
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a large bundle on her back.
 What could it be?</font>

301
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. That does seem convenient.</font>

302
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't it just? 
Now you won't get lost any—</font>

303
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. For you.</font>

304
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never get lost, you see.</font>

305
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I beg your pardon?!</font>

306
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm San. May I ask your name?</font>

307
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm C-Constance Grail.</font>

308
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grail? Why...</font>

309
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a lovely name.</font>

310
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait for me, San!</font>

311
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen until I'm done talking to you!</font>

312
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly! Why must you always...</font>

313
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Lily's key!</font>

314
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is no key.</font>

315
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tracked down where it was made.</font>

316
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's merely a key-shaped decoration.</font>

317
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However,</font>

318
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this inscription was added
 at Lily's express direction.</font>

319
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P10E3...</font>

320
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

321
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me for a moment!</font>

322
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's come over you?</font>

323
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett...</font>

324
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I might have figured it out.</font>
