1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there we go!</font>

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're shining extra bright 
today, guardian deity!</font>

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right?</font>

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to come 
here every day, you know.</font>

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, where's Yoki?</font>

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't notice when he left earlier?</font>

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not at all.</font>

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He told us he was going to the castle.</font>

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The castle?</font>

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is His Majesty Dartz Olta Clariness.</font>

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It goes without saying that 
I have summoned you here</font>

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with regard to what happened 
in the village of Dagaz.</font>

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I guess all kings in this 
world are pompous asses,</i></font>

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>whether they're human or demon.</i></font>

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, that was way too stuffy!</font>

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay if I just talk normally?</font>

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is not, Your Majesty.</font>

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, don't be such a stiff, Sylvia!</font>

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}A king must present himself with dignity.</font>

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, does he always act like this?</i></font>

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}C'mon, what's the problem?</font>

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sorry about that. 
Let's get to the point.</font>

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys ran off the hero 
Miller and a bunch of bandits,</font>

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">saving the village of Dagaz.</font>

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be granted an honorarium 
for your meritorious deed.</font>

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, you get a reward.</font>

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not desire anything in return.</font>

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I merely did what needed to be done.</font>

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Well, that's why 
you're Our Lady Cecilia.</font>

30
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, then, Yoki, what about you?</font>

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My only desire, Your Majesty,</font>

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is one that you cannot grant me.</font>

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wish is one that I 
must fulfill for myself!</font>

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A wish I can't grant?</font>

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it? Money?!</font>

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

37
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A harem?</font>

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

39
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal throne?!</font>

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of these things!</font>

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it, then?! What is it you want?!</font>

42
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is naught but the love of Cecilia!</font>

43
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="18">The love of Cecilia!</font></font>

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?!</i></font>

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you're right! I definitely 
can't give you that!</font>

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Did I just say that?!</i></font>

47
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm <i>so</i> sorry!</font>

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was not the place for you 
to declare your love for someone!</font>

49
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you <i>no</i> common sense <i>at all</i>?!</font>

50
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, seriously!</font>

51
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one really was all on you.</font>

52
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry!</font>

53
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Honestly...</i></font>

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to think about what you've done.</font>

55
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Starting today, you are prohibited 
from seeing Cecilia for one month.</font>

56
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

57
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}That's so cruel...</font>

58
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... I think he already feels bad enough.</font>

59
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that really necessary?</font>

60
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this? Would you miss 
him for the whole month?</font>

61
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, um... the thing is...</font>

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Half a month, then.</font>

63
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happiness.</font>

64
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia!</font>

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain, look.</font>

66
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Shiek?</font>

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wondered why he wasn't back 
yet. So that's where he was.</font>

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's been sad for a long time.</font>

69
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be because of Miller.</font>

70
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He really feels bad that he couldn't 
protect Teal and the gargoyle.</font>

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All done.</font>

72
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My guardian deity!</font>

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, don't cling so closely.</font>

74
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back, Teal and Gar.</font>

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Gar"?</font>

76
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, 'cause he's a gargoyle.</font>

77
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need a name for him, don't we?</font>

78
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, what a lovely name!</font>

79
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he'll always be the 
guardian deity to me.</font>

80
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just ignoring the name I gave him?!</font>

81
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be going back now.</font>

82
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal, come home.</font>

83
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you're right.</font>

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll come again, guardian deity.</font>

85
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't push yourself too hard.</font>

86
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, all of my strength 
comes from you, after all!</font>

87
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, I blew it.</font>

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has something happened?</font>

89
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got carried away, and now I'm 
banned from seeing Cecilia.</font>

90
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

91
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you'll just have to do whatever 
you can to make up for it.</font>

92
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do have plenty of time, after all.</font>

93
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why you came to see me, huh?</font>

94
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have any other choice!</font>

95
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kramen, you gotta give me 
as much work as you can!</font>

96
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to become a man worthy of Cecilia!</font>

97
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, okay.</font>

98
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's wrong with me?</i></font>

99
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, my.</font>

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is that other cup for?</font>

101
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's yours, Mother.</font>

102
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

103
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been just about half a month.</font>

104
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever do you mean?</font>

105
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what Yoki is up to right now.</font>

106
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My husband told me that he seems to 
be putting in quite a lot of work.</font>

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

108
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back!</font>

109
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this, boy? Were you 
working all night again?</font>

110
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I get to see Cecilia again soon.</font>

111
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I'm fired up.</font>

112
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

113
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I have something I 
need to tell you, as well.</font>

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do?</font>

115
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the heck are you—</font>

116
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The wound was more serious than I thought.</font>

117
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're falling apart.</font>

118
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we don't do something...</font>

119
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose I have but a few days left.</font>

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you say anything sooner?!</font>

121
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Saying something would not 
have made any difference.</font>

122
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

123
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I would like you to take 
care of that little girl.</font>

124
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal?</font>

125
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She has not fully overcome her illness.</font>

126
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She could still collapse at any time.</font>

127
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Shiek said her condition was stable...</font>

128
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As one who has been watching her 
since she was young, I can tell.</font>

129
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something has been off recently.</font>

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I fall apart now, 
she will be all alone.</font>

131
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Just leave Teal to me.</font>

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Thank you.</font>

133
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I can move on with no regrets.</font>

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm still going to save 
you, though! I <i>swear</i> it!</font>

135
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There is no time. You 
know it isn't possible.</font>

136
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this room would feel 
so lonely without you.</font>

137
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need you to stick 
around as a work of art.</font>

138
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The gargoyle's body is cracking?</font>

139
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can fix that by feeding him magicite.</font>

140
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? It's that simple?</font>

141
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone knows that.</font>

142
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, seriously? That'll be a cakewalk!</font>

143
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Duke!</font>

144
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:10,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh...</font>

145
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's more to the explanation, though...</font>

146
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, where can I get magicite, anyway?</font>

147
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki!</font>

148
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia?</font>

149
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki, there's trouble!</font>

150
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Teal!</font>

151
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek, how's she doing?</font>

152
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's bad.</font>

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

154
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her fever won't go down.</font>

155
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic can't get rid of the disease itself.</font>

156
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What can we do?</font>

157
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's been burning through 
her strength too quickly.</font>

158
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The medicine we have will 
only buy her some time.</font>

159
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there anything I can do?</font>

160
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm short on herbs. I 
need some twilight grass.</font>

161
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Twilight grass?</font>

162
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a flowering plant that only 
grows in magic-rich places.</font>

163
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't grow in Minerva.</font>

164
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can we...</font>

165
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, leave it to me. I'll look for some.</font>

166
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I'll help you.</font>

167
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks. I'd really appreciate the help.</font>

168
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's still Gar, too.</font>

169
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gar?</font>

170
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has... something happened 
to the guardian deity?</font>

171
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal!</font>

172
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't. You need to stay in bed.</font>

173
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain.</font>

174
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll keep an eye on Teal. 
You can count on me.</font>

175
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

176
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where can we buy magicite?</font>

177
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The merchants' guild should 
sell valuable materials.</font>

178
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's try there, then.</font>

179
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, this was all my idea!</font>

180
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mother! Yoki was just...</font>

181
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I know you're 
concerned for Teal.</font>

182
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

183
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you need to hurry? Off you go, now.</font>

184
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all out of magicite?!</font>

186
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No twilight grass, either?!</font>

187
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm very sorry. Both are in short supply.</font>

188
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're kidding me...</font>

189
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. Good to go?</font>

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kramen, sir! The quest form is all done.</font>

191
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Yoki. Perfect timing.</font>

192
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope.</font>

193
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't even ask you yet.</font>

194
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to 
take a quest, don't you?</font>

195
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have time for that.</font>

196
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need magicite and 
twilight grass, right?</font>

197
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

198
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This quest is for the removal of a 
monster hiding out in a magicite mine.</font>

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's not all. Magic power 
accumulates in that mine,</font>

200
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so twilight grass grows there naturally.</font>

201
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?!</font>

202
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll help me out, right?</font>

203
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe it took two 
days to get to the mine.</font>

204
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Only</i> two days. You said 
you were in a hurry,</font>

205
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I arranged an express carriage for you.</font>

206
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for your help as well, Sophia.</font>

207
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When one of our maids is in danger,</font>

208
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the head maid can't very 
well stand idly by.</font>

209
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finally made it.</font>

210
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We shall head for the mine tomorrow, 
once all preparations are made.</font>

211
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tomorrow? We can't just go now?</font>

212
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The monsters are more active at night.</font>

213
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one we're after will 
be even more of a threat.</font>

214
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this thing really that nasty?</font>

215
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a rock eater that chowed down 
on magicite until it mutated.</font>

216
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So not only is it even more savage now,</font>

217
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it's also highly resistant 
to attack magic.</font>

218
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sorta like Miller's magic sword, I guess.</i></font>

219
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the client wants someone 
to bring back this jolly little</font>

220
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">mutant rock eater's hide unharmed.</font>

221
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we can't just brute-force it this time.</font>

222
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a plan.</font>

223
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if attack magic doesn't work,</font>

224
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's still possible to 
restrain it with magic.</font>

225
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we get moving, then?</font>

226
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In your maid uniform?!</font>

227
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be all right in that?</font>

228
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is proper, order-made battle attire.</font>

229
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh...</font>

230
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My husband says he likes the 
way I look in a maid uniform.</font>

231
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the rock eater?</font>

232
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn, it's eating magicite like 
it's just a crunchy snack.</font>

233
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dear!</font>

234
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On it!</font>

235
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't underestimate us!</font>

236
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That didn't do a thing!</font>

237
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, don't damage the hide.</font>

238
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I know!</font>

239
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to get him to hold still first!</font>

240
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Earth Lock!</font>

241
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help! Saint Chains!</font>

242
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How is it so strong?!</font>

243
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, what now, Kramen?</font>

244
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll cover Sophia with shikigami</font>

245
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so she can go in through its 
mouth and kill it from inside.</font>

246
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that too dangerous?!</font>

247
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Close-range combat is my specialty.</font>

248
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My woman's the best there is.</font>

249
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I see! How about this, then?</font>

250
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well done, Yoki!</font>

251
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, that big mouth's open now!</font>

252
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave this to me.</font>

253
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit flailing!</font>

254
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It split itself up?!</font>

255
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

256
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kramen!</font>

257
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just hold out for one more minute, milady!</font>

258
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

259
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep still!</font>

260
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this!</font>

261
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn! Magic doesn't work 
on those guys, either?</font>

262
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, then...</font>

263
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">how about some of this?!</font>

264
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! At least try to protect yourself!</font>

265
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keeping my shikigami up takes priority!</font>

266
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And go easy on the smitten husband thing!</font>

267
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not... yet!</font>

268
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia!</font>

269
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not hurt, are you, Sophia?</font>

270
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'm just fine.</font>

271
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're such lovebirds.</font>

272
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They sure are.</font>

273
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, now get off of me.</font>

274
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We still need to find the twilight grass.</font>

275
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right!</font>

276
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki! This is it!</font>

277
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is twilight grass, huh?</font>

278
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to hurry back to Minerva.</font>

279
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too dangerous to drive at night.</font>

280
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll leave in the morning.</font>

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, we'll be fine!</font>

282
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki, I understand how you feel,</font>

283
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but please bear with it this time.</font>

284
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maid uniform...</font>

285
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quietly...</font>

286
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cecilia—</font>

287
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shh.</font>

288
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's twilight grass in here.</font>

289
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sophia is sound asleep.</font>

290
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be able to fly to Minerva now.</font>

291
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. I'm impressed you knew, though.</font>

292
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was sure you'd try to go anyway.</font>

293
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

294
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take care of those two.</font>

295
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will. Leave it to me.</font>

296
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm off.</font>

297
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wake up, Gar!</font>

298
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be... Was I too late?</font>

299
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, you little-girl-loving statue!</font>

300
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not gonna let you lead that innocent 
little girl on and then just die!</font>

301
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What has... happened to Teal?</font>

302
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's gonna be fine.</font>

303
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiek's taking care of her.</font>

304
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. That's good.</font>

305
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you need to hurry up and 
eat this magicite, too.</font>

306
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gravely wounded. A 
little magicite cannot—</font>

307
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You never know until you try!</font>

308
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or, what? Do you wanna make poor Teal sad?</font>

309
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's fighting her illness 
because she believes in you!</font>

310
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that? A claw?</font>

311
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Teal...</i></font>

312
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font color="#ffffff">Well, all of my strength 
comes from you, after all!</font></font>

313
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Right... I...</i></font>

314
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My body burns!</font>

315
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be what they call a miracle!</font>

316
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Awesome!</font>

317
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going now!</font>

318
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, wait, Gar!</font>

319
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teal!</font>

320
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guardian... deity?</font>

321
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all right.</font>

322
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn. And I need to get 
back to Cecilia by morning.</font>

323
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad, though.</font>

324
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. It's all thanks to you.</font>

325
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me?</font>

326
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both last time and now,</font>

327
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you protected me and Teal.</font>

328
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

329
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good job, Shiek.</font>

330
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guardian deity, your arm!</font>

331
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Worry not. That bad dream is over now.</font>

332
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

333
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up with Yoki?</font>

334
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He seems particularly exhausted.</font>

335
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoki did work very hard.</font>

336
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mrmph... Cecilia...</font>

337
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is his reward.</font>
