00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's unusually warm today.</font>

4
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but...</font>

5
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we sure could use some cold, hard cash.</font>

6
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have to look for work 
in the next town.</font>

7
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're already thinking about that, Fern?</font>

8
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's important.</font>

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark,</font>

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">unless we think two steps ahead, 
our journey will come to a premature end.</font>

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose that's true.</font>

12
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Work, huh?</font>

13
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope we can find something suitable.</font>

14
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This feels familiar.</font>

16
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the ride.</font>

17
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't mention it. It was most reassuring 
to have a first-class mage along.</font>

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, you're headed to Ende?</font>

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To those of us who never 
travel far from home,</font>

20
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that sounds like an 
unimaginably long journey.</font>

21
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it is.</font>

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,250
<font size="24"><b>{\an8}<font size="33"><font face="Georgia"><font color="#9eccf8">Beyond Journey's End</font></font></font></b></font>

24
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I caught a fish.</font>

25
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll add it to our breakfast.</font>

26
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll catch a big one next time.</font>

27
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's odd. It should be around here.</font>

28
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren's not usually up this early.</font>

29
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently she woke up because 
she was curious about something.</font>

30
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh.</font>

31
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you praise her?</font>

32
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

33
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Found it.</font>

34
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now this is a big one.</font>

35
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a pretty stone. What is it?</font>

36
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

37
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

38
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't conjure fire.</font>

39
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's called a magic-nullifying crystal.</font>

40
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a mineral that neutralizes 
magical effects.</font>

41
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A crystal of this purity has an 
effective radius of three meters.</font>

42
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, try stepping away a bit.</font>

43
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Okay.</font>

44
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There it goes.</font>

45
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're extremely rare.</font>

46
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even a pebble-sized crystal 
is worth several gold pieces.</font>

47
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could buy a mansion 
with one this large.</font>

48
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow.</font>

49
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if it stops us from using magic, 
we can't bring it with us.</font>

50
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd endanger us on our journey.</font>

51
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the problem.</font>

52
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get rid of that stone right away.</font>

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If a monster attacked us right now, 
we'd be wiped out.</font>

54
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before that, I want to show you 
an unusual property of this stone.</font>

55
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really interesting.</font>

56
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you imbue these stones 
with lots of mana...</font>

57
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they glow really brightly.</font>

58
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's blinding.</font>

59
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please just throw it away already.</font>

60
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's still glowing.</font>

61
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll probably reach 
the next village today.</font>

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, are we near 
the Northern Plateau?</font>

63
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's still a ways away.</font>

64
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's beyond a vast forest 
and volcanic area.</font>

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A volcanic area, huh? Sounds dangerous.</font>

66
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really isn't.</font>

67
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There hasn't been an 
eruption in centuries.</font>

68
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These days, it's a relatively safe 
hot spring region.</font>

69
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hot springs?</font>

70
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A warm bath sounds pretty appealing.</font>

71
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sure has been a while.</font>

72
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Hold on.</font>

73
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ground here...</font>

74
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it. It's an underground cave.</font>

75
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate how unstable the 
ground is in marshland.</font>

76
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Ms. Frieren...</font>

77
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

78
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might be in trouble.</font>

79
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What?!</font>

80
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No wonder we found that 
magic-nullifying crystal on the surface.</font>

81
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen a deposit 
this large before.</font>

82
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please get off.</font>

83
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Almost the entire cave is filled 
with magic-nullifying crystals.</font>

84
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we brought it all back with us, 
we'd be billionaires.</font>

85
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt that's possible.</font>

86
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magic-nullifying crystal is one of 
the hardest materials in existence.</font>

88
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And unlike other materials, it can't 
be cut or processed using magic.</font>

89
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some things are simply 
out of humanity's reach.</font>

90
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In any case, we're not 
climbing our way out of here.</font>

91
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's look for another exit.</font>

92
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

93
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're counting on you, Stark.</font>

94
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we can't use magic, 
we're just ordinary girls in here.</font>

95
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girls?</font>

96
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't forgotten that you 
called me an old hag, Stark.</font>

97
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry about that.</font>

98
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still haven't let that go?</font>

99
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never thought we'd end up 
camping in a place like this.</font>

100
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This cave complex is unbelievably vast.</font>

101
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We found lots of animal bones, too.</font>

102
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren said this might be 
the den of a large monster.</font>

103
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm amazed she can sleep so soundly.</font>

104
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She sure is carefree.</font>

105
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren still seems to be 
having fun, even here.</font>

106
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it scares me too much.</font>

107
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't even detect mana.</font>

108
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never experienced 
anything like this.</font>

109
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like I've been plunged 
into total darkness.</font>

110
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern...</font>

111
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A monster!</font>

112
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, wake up! Run—</font>

113
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a venomous apex dragon.</font>

114
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Venomous?</font>

115
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a bad matchup for you.</font>

116
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll die from poison again.</font>

117
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't die the first time!</font>

118
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what are we supposed to do, then?</font>

119
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you were sleeping 
so comfortably, either.</font>

120
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can you be so—</font>

121
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I trust you with my life.</font>

122
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have ever since I recruited you 
to be our front-liner.</font>

123
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Parties don't function otherwise.</font>

124
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a man who flees 
during critical moments.</font>

125
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm desperate to run away right now.</font>

126
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you?</font>

127
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we run away together, then?</font>

128
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, Fern.</font>

129
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Close your eyes.</font>

130
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel, how can you 
trust me with your life?</font>

131
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not something you 
should say so readily.</font>

132
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I abandoned my village and fled.</font>

133
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that right?</font>

134
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then if you feel like running, 
let's run away together.</font>

135
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, we're a party.</font>

136
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we run, then?</font>

137
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a priest! Why do I have 
to carry the heavy one?</font>

138
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because the light one 
says you stink of liquor!</font>

139
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was scary.</font>

140
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But running away together 
isn't so bad, is it?</font>

141
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

142
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we go, then?</font>

143
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren.</font>

144
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

145
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My legs gave out. I can't walk.</font>

146
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,030
<font face="Times New Roman">{\an7}<font color="#f7fffa">Episode 29: Shall We Go, Then?</font></font>

147
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,030

148
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this enough for lunch?</font>

149
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? They're not here.</font>

150
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I came back too early.</font>

151
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll go fishing.</font>

152
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll catch a big one today.</font>

153
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cold...</font>

154
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just until we reach the hot springs.</font>

155
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. It's clean now.</font>

156
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't Stark give you that 
mirrored-lotus bracelet?</font>

157
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hairpin you gave me 
is also clean now.</font>

158
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You keep your staff in good shape, too.</font>

159
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to really enjoy maintaining 
your equipment, Fern.</font>

160
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do I?</font>

161
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're smiling right now.</font>

162
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's because they were gifts.</font>

163
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I lost everything, including 
my home, to war.</font>

164
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps I'm glad to gain more things 
that are important to me.</font>

165
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was worth the effort 
picking that out for you.</font>

166
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did put a lot of thought into it.</font>

167
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you know that?</font>

168
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

169
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,950

170
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really sorry!</font>

171
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't know you were bathing!</font>

172
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not mad.</font>

173
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, all done.</font>

174
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, I've been thinking...</font>

175
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

176
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are things a bit awkward right now?</font>

177
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They might be.</font>

178
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're starting to pick up 
on stuff like this, too.</font>

179
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm kind of impressed.</font>

180
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This seems to happen from time to time.</font>

181
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you two aren't a good match.</font>

182
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say that.</font>

183
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark.</font>

184
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're uncomfortable, say so.</font>

185
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the one who forced you 
to join the party.</font>

186
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Frieren, I—</font>

187
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a crossroads.</font>

188
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Northern Plateau is this way.</font>

189
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neutral Harbor is that way.</font>

190
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, is that an inn?</font>

191
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, this <i>is</i> a major highway.</font>

192
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't have to camp out tonight.</font>

193
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

194
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, if it isn't Frieren.</font>

195
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our reunion was sooner than expected.</font>

196
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stark, thanks for your help 
with the Fresser.</font>

197
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wirbel, you seem well.</font>

198
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I ended up traveling home by sea.</font>

199
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The demons are acting up 
in the far north again.</font>

200
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to rush back.</font>

201
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm traveling with these guys 
to the imperial capital.</font>

202
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's been whining about how 
much he hates being seasick.</font>

203
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you a grown man? 
What are you doing?</font>

204
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just so you know, I'm not that old yet.</font>

205
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was still in my twenties 
until just recently.</font>

206
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another old man used 
to say the same thing.</font>

207
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, Stark, have you 
considered my offer?</font>

208
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What offer?</font>

209
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The situation in the far north 
has gotten pretty bad.</font>

210
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a severe shortage 
of front-liners.</font>

211
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't force you into it,</font>

212
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'd like your support for two or 
three years until the front stabilizes.</font>

213
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I told you before, Wirbel, 
I'm <i>this</i> party's front-liner.</font>

214
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Well, I don't give up easily.</font>

215
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do anything to protect the far north.</font>

216
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren, mind if I persuade him a little?</font>

217
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me—</font>

218
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Suit yourself.</font>

219
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren...</font>

220
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

221
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Seriously, Stark. Join our party.</font>

222
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He seems to be having fun.</font>

223
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I really can't.</font>

224
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe Stark does find our 
party a bit restrictive.</font>

225
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Mr. Stark.</font>

226
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I turned down Wirbel's offer.</font>

227
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure you want 
to do that, Mr. Stark?</font>

228
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern, why do you think I'm in this party?</font>

229
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I first met you guys,</font>

230
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was at the end of my rope.</font>

231
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was ready to abandon 
the village and run away.</font>

232
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suck, right?</font>

233
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:33,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frieren said she forced me to join the 
party, but that's not what happened.</font>

234
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you'll run.</font>

235
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you encouraged me that night,</font>

236
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to travel with you 
and joined your party.</font>

237
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may not realize it,</font>

238
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but Frieren isn't the only one who 
dragged my cowardly butt this far.</font>

239
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

240
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So be nicer to me.</font>

241
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

242
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come here. I'll pet you.</font>

243
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you plotting?! I'm scared!</font>

244
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a pain in the rear.</i></font>

245
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't convince you after all, huh?</font>

246
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, you're not traveling by boat?</font>

247
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ocean travel is expensive.</font>

248
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides...</font>

249
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My master's party traveled 
through the Northern Plateau.</font>

to follow, huh?</font>

253
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter. You'll reach the 
far north eventually, right?</font>

254
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see you then.</font>

255
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,610
