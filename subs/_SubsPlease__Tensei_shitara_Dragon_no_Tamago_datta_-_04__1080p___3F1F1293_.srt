00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I told you no!</font>

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You are absolutely not
going into the forest!</font>

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But Mr. Doz might still be alive!</font>

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then why hasn't he
come back to the village?</font>

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I-I'm not sure why, but...</font>

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If you're worried about me going alone,</font>

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">then let's get the villagers
to form a search party!</font>

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Will you give it a rest already?!</font>

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We cannot afford to risk your life
or that of anyone else in the village!</font>

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay.</font>

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't worry.</font>

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll ask the guild to investigate.</font>

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Adventurers should
come to help in due time.</font>

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">All right.</font>

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm sorry for being so unreasonable.</font>

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I ate well and slept so good yesterday.</font>

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now I'm gonna level up like crazy
and aim for that Human Transformation!</font>

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's that?</font>

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Can't be just a puddle, right?</font>

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maybe it's a monster.</font>

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Doesn't look very strong.</font>

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can use this to farm experience points.</font>

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wonder what its stats-</font>

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Ow!</font>

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My head hurts! What is this?!</font>

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The View Stats skill cannot provide
such specific information at level three.</font>

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Even my eyes are burning!</font>

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The "View Stats" skill has gone from
level three to level four.</font>

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Whoa!</font>

30
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wh-what the hell is that?!</font>

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What was that stuff?</font>

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh no!</font>

33
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What in the world was that?</font>

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Definitely something
I shouldn't get close to!</font>

35
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But its stats weren't anything special...</font>

36
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh well, I should just leave it be.</font>

37
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll search
in a different direction today.</font>

38
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's that?</font>

39
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A pot?</font>

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It'd probably be handy
to put fruits and stuff in.</font>

41
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's a monster?!</font>

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dragon Punch!</font>

47
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That did nothing!</font>

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll have to give it all I've got, then!</font>

52
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's too hard!</font>

53
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, then!</font>

54
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A tortoise, eh?</font>

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,750

57
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,960

140
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What do I do?</font>

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't beat him in one shot
at my current level.</font>

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The most powerful thing I have
is that Meteorite skill I just learned,</font>

143
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">but there's no way it could pick up
that behemoth and fly.</font>

144
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For now, I'll just have to use
hit-and-run tactics!</font>

145
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll go around to the back...</font>

146
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and attack!</font>

147
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then immediately run!</font>

148
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Come on! Bring it!</font>

149
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can win if I keep running down its MP!</font>

150
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This fight is mine!</font>

151
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is that a Sandstorm skill?!</font>

152
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're kidding me...</font>

153
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey, that's cheating, man!</font>

154
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't hit you with my Roll attack now!</font>

155
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">My plan of going around the back
won't work anymore.</font>

156
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's lost a whole lot of MP.</font>

157
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maybe because it used
Regenerate, Sandstorm,</font>

158
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and Transform?</font>

159
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What happened to its body?</font>

160
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Maybe I could...</font>

161
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Now!</font>

162
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The clay softens
when it's away from the body!</font>

163
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">If I use this to hit it with Meteorite...</font>

164
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">No, that probably won't
take away all its HP.</font>

165
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It can still use Regenerate
even with just a little left.</font>

166
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well then!</font>

167
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, just shut up already!</font>

168
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Did I do it?</font>

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have gained 150 experience points.</font>

of the "Walking Egg" title,</font>

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,000

177
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, that attack I just did
became a skill, huh?</font>

178
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It wasn't very cool, though.</font>

179
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But...</font>

180
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">it sure did look like a Nutcracker.</font>

181
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In any case, I got the clay.</font>

187
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Because it leaches all nutrition

it has a slightly paralyzing poison.</font>

but the salt is stocked up in here, huh?</font>

203
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,210

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't worry.
I'll ask the guild to investigate.</font>

that Mr. Doz is still alive...</font>

we're going back home.</font>

if I had just stopped them.</font>

223
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So if Mr. Doz is still alive,
then I have to find him.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This fruit was that valuable?</font>

251
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll gather some to try.</font>

252
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm pretty deep in the forest now.</font>

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It might be too dangerous
to go any further.</font>

255
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,670

I'll cover the wall with bricks.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Miss Meltia, wake up! We're here!</font>

278

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">There's no doubt about it.</font>

wants us to investigate.</font>

281
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm home!</font>

282
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Oh, right. No one's gonna answer me.</font>

283
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Well, better butcher the meat
and strip the pelts from these wolves.</font>

284
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'll put the pelts out to dry later.</font>

285
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm getting pretty used to this world.</font>

286
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Hey!</font>

287
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Dang it! Those stupid monkeys!</font>

288
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've gotta do something or they're gonna
eat my entire stock of jerky!</font>

289
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I need to fend them off somehow.</font>

290
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Just you wait, stupid monkeys!</font>

291
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm gonna steep some jerky
in this poisonous concoction</font>

292
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">that I just cooked up.</font>

293
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Then let you eat it!</font>

294
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You know,</font>

295
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've pretty much learned
how to tell from sight</font>

296
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">whether wild plants are poisonous or not.</font>

297
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Seems like there's
poison flowers around here.</font>

298
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Wait. Forget poison.</font>

299
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I should decorate the outside of my cave</font>

300
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">with some pretty flowers to help take the
edge off the pains of everyday life.</font>

301
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,170

302
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've never seen
that kind of monster before.</font>
