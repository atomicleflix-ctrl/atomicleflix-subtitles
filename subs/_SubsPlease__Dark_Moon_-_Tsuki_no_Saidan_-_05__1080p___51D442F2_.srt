<font face="Times New Roman" size="13"><b>{\an8}<font size="30">- Dark Moon: The Blood Altar -</font></b></font>

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From here, the winger, 
Mahan, will pass to Khan.</font>

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then Tahel will cover from this position.</font>

5
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay! We'll run through this play
 once Mahan and the others are back.</font>

7
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get the championship title back.</font>

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll wipe the smirks off 
those Decelis guys' faces.</font>

9
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Captain?</font>

10
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Uh, sorry.</font>

11
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you say?</font>

12
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're discussing our game 
plan for the nightball game.</font>

13
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. Yeah, I agree.</font>

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you even listening?</font>

15
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Of course I was.</font>

16
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what did we say?</font>

17
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Basically, I just need to score, right?</font>

18
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khan, something's off about you today.</font>

19
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been absent-minded all day.</font>

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's not true.</font>

21
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen?</font>

22
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, nothing happened.</font>

23
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just tired.</font>

24
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to sleep.</font>

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, by the way,</font>

26
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this is from them.</font>

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dog?</font>

28
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're looking for a fight.</font>

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, it's an invitation 
to their birthday party.</font>

30
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should we do?</font>

31
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd never go to that.</font>

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who'd celebrate <i>their</i> birthday?</font>

33
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

34
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you guys said you wanted to go.</font>

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were just being polite.</font>

36
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should get some rest.</font>

38
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodnight.</font>

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be because of the total eclipse.</font>

41
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why'd it have to be a human, huh?</font>

42
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I hope it works out.</font>

43
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sent them an invitation?</font>

44
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like I had a choice.</font>

45
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha said she wanted to invite them, too.</font>

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that's what Sooha wants, 
it's not like we can say no.</font>

47
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I don't like celebrating 
our birthday with werewolves.</font>

48
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does Sooha even 
like about them, anyway?</font>

49
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't ask me.</font>

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because they hate vampires, isn't it?</font>

51
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't remind me.</font>

53
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never get over it.</font>

54
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about it.</font>

55
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She didn't know about us 
when she said that.</font>

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Sooha finds out what we really are, 
she'll never want to see us again.</font>

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't matter what she thinks.</font>

58
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is why I said not
 to get close to her.</font>

59
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? But I want to be friends with Sooha!</font>

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never expected her to 
hate us that much, though.</font>

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody likes us.</font>

62
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's natural for a human to hate us.</font>

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And her friend was killed by vampires.</font>

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't hurt humans, though.</font>

65
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We know that about ourselves.</font>

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But to humans, we're no 
different from other vampires.</font>

67
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Telling her we're an exception 
won't solve the problem.</font>

68
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True. We can't force her to trust us.</font>

69
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like anyone's ever 
believed us before.</font>

70
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we have no choice.</font>

71
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll tell Sooha that Solon is a vampire 
so the rest of us will be off the hook.</font>

72
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

73
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

74
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Solon's a vampire?!</font>

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. It caught
 us by surprise, too!</font>

76
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's not waste any time.</font>

77
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's some firewood.</font>

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's a light.</font>

79
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Die, you horrible vampire!</font>

80
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Solon, we won't forget your sacrifice.</font>

81
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll keep you in our hearts forever.</font>

82
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noa, why are you gathering firewood?</font>

84
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Jino, why are you lighting it?</font>

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I gathered so much.</font>

86
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm playing along.</font>

87
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't be serious!</font>

88
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sheesh! Your sacrifice 
would solve everything!</font>

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then you sacrifice yourself!</font>

90
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough. For now, you two will 
be the candidates for that plan.</font>

91
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not a candidate for anything!</font>

92
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In any case, let's make sure she 
doesn't find out what we are.</font>

93
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

94
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should avoid using our 
powers as much as possible.</font>

95
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she finds out what we are,</font>

96
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we won't be able to stay here anymore.</font>

97
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought we'd get to stay 
at this school for a while.</font>

98
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt Sooha would tell anyone even 
if she found out we're vampires.</font>

99
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't know that.</font>

100
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires don't feel any love at all.</font>

101
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires are just cold, brutal monsters!</font>

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Werewolves are way better!</font>

103
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you can't even compare them.</font>

104
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires are the worst!</font>

105
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heli.</font>

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you are.</font>

107
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'm sorry about earlier.</font>

108
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got so worked up.</font>

109
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. I know how much
 you hate vampires.</font>

110
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only natural.</font>

111
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Thanks.</font>

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We forgot to give this to you earlier.</font>

113
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, you said 
there was a birthday coming up.</font>

114
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone would be glad to see you there.</font>

115
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you'll come.</font>

116
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course! By the way, 
whose birthday is it?</font>

117
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of ours.</font>

118
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of us knows the day we were born.</font>

120
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

121
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what's this day?</font>

122
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the day we left the orphanage.</font>

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After the hell we went through 
the day we fled Vanfield,</font>

124
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you guys still trust humans?</font>

125
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is anyone chasing us?</font>

126
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we're good.</font>

127
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a house!</font>

128
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ran away from the orphanage?</font>

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't use this storage shed.</font>

130
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's safe here, so you can rest.</font>

131
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you.</font>

132
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay. I won't tell anyone.</font>

133
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This will help a lot.</font>

134
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

135
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's leave once we've had a little rest.</font>

136
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm hungry.</font>

137
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too.</font>

138
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Suck it up.</font>

139
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be hungry.</font>

140
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These are just leftovers, but...</font>

141
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires showed up?</font>

142
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to kill them all this instant.</font>

143
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is where you've been.</font>

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I tell you?</font>

145
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's dangerous outside the orphanage.</font>

146
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let's go back to Vanfield House.</font>

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can only trust each other.</font>

148
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,920
<font face="Times New Roman" size="13"><b>{\an8}- Dark Moon: The Blood Altar -</b></font>

149
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,920
<font face="Times New Roman" size="13"><b>{\an8}- Dark Moon: The Blood Altar -</b></font>

150
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha, you mentioned before that 
your friend was killed by vampires.</font>

151
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

152
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you close?</font>

153
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know how I have that weird power?</font>

154
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It made people think I was a vampire,</font>

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I was always all alone.</font>

156
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My parents told me never to use my power.</font>

157
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris was the only one who understood me.</font>

158
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But one day...</font>

159
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris is still inside!</font>

160
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't go in there!</font>

161
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let go of me!</font>

162
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris has a bad leg!</font>

163
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, you!</font>

164
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I could think about was saving him.</font>

165
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't do it, Sooha.</font>

166
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anyone sees you, 
they'll get the wrong idea.</font>

167
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone will think you're a vampire.</font>

168
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris!</font>

169
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris!</font>

170
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I don't care what anyone thinks."</font>

171
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I don't care what anyone says about me."</font>

172
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chris!</font>

173
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on!</font>

174
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll save... you...</font>

175
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that moment, I thought...</font>

176
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd been given this power</font>

177
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I could do this.</font>

178
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believed...</font>

179
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:56,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you'd come.</font>

180
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may never find 
another friend like Chris.</font>

181
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:17,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He even told me to bite his neck once 
because he believed I wasn't a vampire.</font>

182
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not even I could trust myself, but he...</font>

183
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could never like vampires.</font>

184
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha.</font>

185
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to try biting my neck?</font>

186
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

187
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

188
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait, what are you talking about?!</font>

189
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, it's not like
 I hate you or anything...</font>

190
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

191
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were kids back then.</font>

192
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The situation is totally different now.</font>

193
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're on our way to 
becoming adults, you know?</font>

194
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-In any case, that's that!</font>

195
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So?</font>

196
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead.</font>

197
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! This is too embarrassing!</font>

198
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do it!</font>

199
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I trust you that much, too.</font>

200
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

201
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true.</font>

202
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What about you, Heli?</font>

203
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

204
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you bite my neck?</font>

205
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh...</font>

206
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? You think it's embarrassing, too!</font>

207
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, so do I!</font>

208
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You're right.</font>

209
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be honest, one of the reasons I wanted 
to come to this school was its library.</font>

210
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has a lot of old books, so I thought
 I could find the vampire's weakness.</font>

211
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But some vampires showed up 
at the plaza the other day.</font>

212
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was my first time 
actually seeing one,</font>

213
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I'd never been so terrified.</font>

214
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't stop shaking.</font>

215
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was like my whole body froze.</font>

216
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that made me realize something.</font>

217
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vampires really are monsters.</font>

218
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

219
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd better head back.</font>

220
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for coming to deliver this.</font>

221
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone's excited to see you there.</font>

222
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

223
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mahan, how are things over there?</font>

224
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We still don't know where our 
missing friends were taken.</font>

225
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, someone saw 
vampires near this town.</font>

226
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. We entered Decelis to 
investigate that girl's death,</font>

227
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but those vampires didn't 
have anything to do with it.</i></font>

228
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As if they'd ever tell you the truth.</font>

229
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's a fact that vampires 
are attacking our friends.</i></font>

230
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but I saw them fighting 
vampires the other day.</font>

231
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the very least, 
they didn't seem like allies.</font>

232
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, several werewolves 
have gone missing from town.</font>

233
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Vampires must be involved somehow.</i></font>

234
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll come after you, too, 
if they learn you're vampires.</font>

235
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be careful when you transform.</font>

236
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I know.</i></font>

237
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ruslan, you'll be back in time 
for the nightball game, right?</font>

238
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Of course.</i></font>

239
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kamil, you're not out of shape, are you?</i></font>

240
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about me.</font>

241
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We'll call again later.</i></font>

242
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

243
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Bye.</i></font>

244
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Khan...</font>

245
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khan might be bothered 
that he can't transform.</font>

246
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know about that.</font>

247
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None of us care about that.</font>

248
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We couldn't ask for 
a better leader than Khan.</font>

249
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

250
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But everyone's bothered 
by different things.</font>

251
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you part vampire?</font>

252
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't even know what I am.</font>

253
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not the only one. 
It's the same for the other guys.</font>

254
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are the werewolves actually coming?</font>

255
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They haven't responded
 to our invitation yet.</font>

256
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I bet they aren't.</font>

257
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, we're still preparing 
things in case they show up.</font>

258
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think of this?</font>

259
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've always been a great artist.</font>

260
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I helped with this spot around here.</font>

261
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My masterpiece!</font>

262
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

263
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heli dropped the cake.</font>

264
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really sorry.</font>

265
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be helped.</font>

266
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We still have time. Let's make a new one.</font>

267
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't have a birthday 
party without a cake.</font>

268
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd better go buy the ingredients.</font>

269
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's ask Jakah to do it.</font>

270
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

271
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think? Pretty nice, right?</font>

272
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jakah, sorry, but we need some 
things bought in a hurry.</font>

273
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure thing. I've got this.</font>

274
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Is it burnt?</font>

275
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for waiting.</font>

276
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You saved the day.</font>

277
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's convenient having Jakah 
around at times like this.</font>

278
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no ramen.</font>

279
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

280
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wasn't on the list.</font>

281
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heli, did you forget to write it down?</font>

282
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do we even need ramen?</font>

283
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

284
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really want ramen...</font>

285
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to go out again?!</font>

286
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nearly time.</font>

287
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Sooha!</font>

288
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome.</font>

289
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've been waiting for you!</font>

290
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a lovely place.</font>

291
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for coming.</font>

292
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet it was tough getting out here
 to the middle of the woods.</font>

293
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it was fine. I was surprised, though.</font>

294
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't expect to find a beautiful 
mansion this deep in the woods.</font>

295
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right? I built it.</font>

296
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, we were just fortunate 
enough to inherit it.</font>

297
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? From who?</font>

298
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There was someone who supported 
us after we left the orphanage.</font>

299
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

300
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They did a lot for us, but they passed 
away, so we inherited this place.</font>

301
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

302
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we live in the dorms, we only make 
it out here on weekends and summer break.</font>

303
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The garden is beautiful, too.</font>

304
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I maintain it.</font>

305
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a lie, too.</font>

306
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in. I'll show you around.</font>

307
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sooha.</font>

308
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khan!</font>

309
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey.</font>

310
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Next time, Episode 6: 
"Hunter's Moon: Birthday Party."</i></font>

311
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,250
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#f9fcfd"><b><font size="25">- Birthday Party -</font></b></font>
