167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,490

and scary in general.</font>

168
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what that was all about?</font>

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. They were all scary.</font>

172
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you're misremembering! 
Try harder! Come on!</font>

173
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,960

174
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The analysis of the orally 
administered version is finished.</font>

175
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Its effects are weaker than earlier
doses, without added psychotropics.</font>

176
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means it can't be used 
to turn users into villains.</font>

177
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:05,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it runs the risk of wider 
distribution as a new casual designer drug.</font>

178
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

179
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like they've gone 
in a different direction.</font>

180
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's been a decrease in instant 
villain incidents since summer ended,</font>

181
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and in their place, we're seeing 
more of the modified villains.</font>

182
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, like what happened to Kamayan.</font>

183
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the octopus from the other day.</font>

184
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm inclined to think that their focus 
is going be on the modified villains,</font>

185
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and maybe this new Trigger is a way 
to select for potential candidates.</font>

186
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then the idea is to use the weaker Trigger 
to cause a bunch of Quirks to run wild,</font>

187
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and if they see anything that looks
useful, they kidnap and alter that person?</font>

188
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would have them manufacturing 
villains like a literal factory.</font>

189
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just your theory, though, right?</font>

190
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Couldn't it just be someone else 
trying to drum up new business</font>

191
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">now that the crab route's 
shut down, officer?</font>

192
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not likely. From what we learned from 
the suspect behind the mixer incident,</font>

193
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's likely the person who gave her 
the orally administered Trigger</font>

194
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the same villain who destroyed 
the evidence of the crab route.</font>

195
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one with the acceleration Quirk.</font>

196
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We investigated the bar that had 
been used for the drug deal,</font>

197
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it had already been cleared out.</font>

198
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're one step behind.</font>

199
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Between this and the crab stuff,
this guy is good at cutting his losses.</font>

200
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're gonna need to lock down the distro 
beforehand if you wanna get him.</font>

201
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But judging from the 
composition and packaging,</font>

202
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="20"><b><font color="#343d3d"><font size="19">Evidence</font></font></b></font>

203
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's likely that this new type of drug is 
coming in from the greater Asian market,</font>

204
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and being distributed at 
the individual level.</font>

205
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So someone's personally importing the stuff?</font>

206
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That'll make it harder for the domestic 
cops and heroes to do anything about it.</font>

207
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If making any public moves 
is gonna be a problem,</font>

208
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">maybe I should take care of it quietly.</font>

209
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, there are... legal issues with that.</font>

210
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,170

214
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,870

with. Might be under a bad influence.</font>

255
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Tamao.</font>

256
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you should play yourself, instead 
of expecting everyone else to?</font>

257
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it supposed to be 
good physical therapy?</font>

258
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. I never really liked the 
guitar that much, anyway.</font>

259
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was mostly playing it to 
get on my dad's nerves.</font>

260
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then let's get on his nerves some more!</font>

261
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. You're actually pretty good, Soga.</font>

262
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He used to play a bit 
back in the day, right?</font>

263
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd he quit?</font>

264
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guitar got smashed in a fight and that was that.</font>

265
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing good comes from having 
a short fuse, am I right?</font>

266
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. It was out of tune.</font>

267
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some people who want to play 
don't have the instruments.</font>

268
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you've got the chance,
then quit whining and do it.</font>

269
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Except it was your own fault 
when yours got busted!</font>

270
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Easy there, Rapt.</font>

271
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. Been a while, people.</font>

272
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's him!</font>

273
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fist geezer!</font>

274
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The beard looks nasty.</font>

275
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I guess I have been 
roughing it for a while.</font>

276
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't matter where you've been,</font>

277
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt it justifies ditching 
your family for this long!</font>

278
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, it's fine.</font>

279
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The old coot's just taking up space,
even when he's around.</font>

280
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm taking off then.</font>

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate to trouble you, but I actually 
need to take off again, today.</font>

282
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're apologizing to the wrong person.</font>

283
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got a point.</font>

284
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Tamao. I just need 
to drop by and visit someone.</font>

285
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be right back, this time.</font>

286
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shave that gross beard first.</font>

287
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Play the guitar, Tamao.</font>

288
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anything is fine, just make some noise.</font>

289
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Payback against that pain in 
the ass dad of yours.</font>

290
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soga, you're such a sweetie!</font>

291
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really appreciate you 
coming all the way out.</font>

292
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just can't bring myself to trust 
digital communication, y'know?</font>

293
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I also prefer to see people 
in person when I can myself.</font>

294
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like being close enough to see them,
hear them.. and hit them if I need to.</font>

295
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the way you looked wasn't enough,</font>

296
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">talk like that'd make it hard 
to believe you're a hero.</font>

297
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm not one.</font>

298
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. It's... Kuroiwa now, right?</font>

299
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what did you have for me today?</font>

300
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A list of customers from 
a dealer in Hong Kong.</font>

301
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I highlighted the Japanese 
citizens who are importing stuff.</font>

302
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how certain can I be of this intel?</font>

303
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This guy's been in the biz for a long time.</font>

304
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it got out that he'd been rolled over 
by another operation, it'd kill his rep.</font>

305
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when he realized it'd save him another 
beating from someone posing as a customer,</font>

306
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he suddenly got real cooperative.</font>

307
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makes sense.</font>

308
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Investigating it from 
here is the police's job.</font>

309
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be in contact if I find anything else.</font>

310
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hate to keep you when you're in a 
hurry, but there was one other thing.</font>

311
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Kuroiwa, would you be familiar with 
anyone who has a Quirk like O'Clock's?</font>

312
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. Doesn't ring a bell.</font>

313
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you run into a villain like that,
shoot first and ask questions later.</font>

314
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of our younger guys tried, believe me.</font>

315
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No warning shots. I'm talking about 
shooting to subdue from the start.</font>

316
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second he knows what's coming,
he'll be able to dodge.</font>

317
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're kinda obligated not to 
do that. Comes with the job.</font>

318
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a bad match for the cops, then. 
Have someone else take care of it.</font>

319
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking down guys like that 
is what I'm here for.</font>

320
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I figured. And I'll pretend 
I didn't hear that.</font>

321
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eraser isn't here today?!</font>

322
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He doesn't work here, y'know!</font>

323
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll call him now though, so chill out.</font>

324
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cruller! Just keep circling around, okay?</font>

325
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

326
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

327
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you see Master over there just now?</font>

328
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Focus on running!</font>

329
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I imagine it?</font>

330
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd help if he was here!</font>

331
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had something else to do today, didn't I?</font>

332
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. A shave.</font>

333
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something I came to understand 
when trying to become a hero</font>

334
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the fact that there's a limit 
to what one person can accomplish.</font>

335
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next time: Rain and Cloud.</font>

336
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A meeting like that had to have been fate.</font>
