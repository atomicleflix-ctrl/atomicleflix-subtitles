00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other one is Elpis.</font>

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This doesn't require much Idea to wield.</font>

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,820

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,150

knowing that I would disappear.</font>

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I really shouldn't have

118
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,230

154
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Choosing to betray your homeland</font>

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After using Elpis, the only thing

159
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,440

160
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,210

162
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,840

163
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,350

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll save both of his homes.</font>

166
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,360

273
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Exudation of the Mirage

344
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,450

who's stolen everything from you,</font>

345
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that might be hard to accept.</font>

346
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happens to me?</font>

347
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happens to Earth?</font>

348
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Apollo only thinks of saving XENOS.</font>

349
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He will sacrifice everything else.</font>

00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You understand it, right?</font>

356
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You understand my loneliness, don't you?</font>

357
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,840
