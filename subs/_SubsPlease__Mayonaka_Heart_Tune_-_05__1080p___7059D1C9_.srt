1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A proxy confession service, huh?</font>

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah. We were thinking of using 
the lunchtime broadcast for that.</font>

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know the school rules.</font>

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Relationships aren't allowed on paper.</font>

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we didn't want to be found out.</font>

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That rule's not really 
enforced, though, right?</font>

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, can we go ahead with it?</font>

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope. Sounds like a pain.</font>

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Saw that coming!</font>

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to get in trouble.</font>

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and your 
never-rock-the-boat attitude!</font>

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My life goal is to go to the grave 
without ever making waves.</font>

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did she even become a teacher?</font>

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ando-sensei.</font>

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an honor to finally meet you.</font>

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please allow yours truly to enlighten you 
on the benefits of this service.</font>

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're annoying. And fired.</font>

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is why I didn't 
want boys in this club.</font>

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All you think about is being popular, 
so you always act like you're hot shit.</font>

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This is tyranny!</font>

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, Lemon-chan.</font>

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really want to do this.</font>

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not every day you stick 
to your guns, Uzuki.</font>

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's still a no.</font>

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because this sounds like a pain.</font>

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, why did she become a teacher?</font>

28
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something in it 
for you too, Lemon-chan.</font>

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our club bombed last year's sports day, 
but we're nailing it this year, right?</font>

30
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose.</font>

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you aware?</font>

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your stock is rising fast right now.</font>

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this event goes well too,</font>

34
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">your stock as a teacher 
will go through the roof.</font>

35
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A peaceful life is nice and all,</font>

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the view from the top 
of the world is pretty great, too.</font>

37
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you standing around for?</font>

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've got work to do.</font>

39
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a self-serving teacher.</i></font>

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's first on the list?</font>

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Handing out flyers on the sly.</font>

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not happening.</font>

44
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look.</font>

45
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Listen up! Boys and girls sit separately!</i></font>

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}No relationships until you're twenty!</i></font>

47
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh.</font>

48
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Get away!</i></font>

49
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's Samejima, the P.E. teacher.</font>

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's watching the students during lunch.</font>

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just try handing those flyers out 
where he can see.</font>

52
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}PROXY CONFESSIONS</font>

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be a scandal before you know it.</font>

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True...</font>

55
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What now? People can't 
show up if they don't know.</font>

56
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We could use the group chats.</font>

57
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't reach the first- 
and third-years with that.</font>

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, why do you think I'm here?</font>

59
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To slack?</font>

60
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll distract Samejima.</font>

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can buy you ten minutes at most. 
Hand them out in that time.</font>

62
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemon-chan!</font>

63
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now hurry!</font>

65
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Operation Lemon is underway!</font>

66
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit taking credit.</font>

67
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit taking charge.</font>

68
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>You there! Stop talking 
to the girls for no reason!</i></font>

69
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Break the rules, and you'll have to 
write an apology letter on the spot!</i></font>

70
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So annoying.</font>

71
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His pecs are gross.</font>

72
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Sensei sees all! Remember that!</i></font>

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samejima-sensei.</font>

74
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're working so hard.</font>

75
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we teachers 
take a quick break, too?</font>

76
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, but...</font>

77
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm on supervision duty.</font>

78
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A quick break... A quickie, if you will?</font>

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take a break 
until the turn of the century!</font>

80
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can rest in the shade.</font>

81
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

82
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She sucks at winking.</font>

83
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now's our chance! Hand those flyers out!</font>

84
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're the broadcasting club.</font>

85
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're holding a lunchtime event.</font>

86
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Feel free to take part.</font>

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell the teachers.</font>

88
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's happening?</font>

89
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds fun!</font>

90
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! I got a flyer from Himekawa-san!</font>

91
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be so loud about it!</font>

92
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We do need to grab attention 
to let everyone know.</font>

93
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do we do? We can't be 
too loud, or Sensei will notice.</font>

94
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How to catch the eye...</font>

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, gather round, broadcasting club.</font>

96
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're dismissed, errand boy.</font>

97
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I've got a great idea.</font>

98
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

99
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No way.</font>

101
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's a fun idea.</font>

102
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm down.</font>

103
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind.</font>

104
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm against it.</font>

105
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just do it, Rikka.</font>

106
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do this for Shinobu 
and make her event a hit.</font>

107
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, look!</font>

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa! What's going on?</font>

109
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're the broadcasting club.</font>

110
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're hosting an event at lunch, 
and everyone can participate.</font>

111
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-Please join us.</font>

112
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have a flyer.</font>

113
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Squee! Rikka-chan's cute!</font>

114
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uzuki-san's adorbs!</font>

115
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look this way, Nene-chan!</font>

116
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's happening? Let's go check it out!</font>

117
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good thing I left my costumes at school.</font>

118
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's kind of embarrassing, though.</font>

119
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A moustache?</font>

120
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You owe me some cake later, Shinobu.</font>

121
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, they're brute-forcing it.</font>

122
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see why they 
didn't need an errand boy.</font>

123
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yamabuki!</font>

124
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do this! This operation is over!</font>

125
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got explosive speed!</font>

126
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Why'd you bring him here?!</font>

127
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

128
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with that crowd?</font>

129
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! What are you doing?</font>

130
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yikes.</font>

131
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Retreat!</font>

132
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, hold it!</font>

133
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">State your names!</font>

134
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was close!</font>

135
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I lost my pom-poms.</font>

136
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was spine-tingling.</font>

137
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm never doing that again.</font>

138
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we're all set.</font>

139
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we just pray that people 
who want to confess show up.</font>

140
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go over the process one more time.</font>

141
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}CONFESSORS
IKO-NENE-RIKKA-SHINOBU</font>

142
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, the confessors will wait 
in the next classroom.</font>

143
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be standing by there 
to assist them, too.</font>

144
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The room's dark, so nobody 
can see who's in there.</font>

145
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Privacy is guaranteed.</font>

146
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}BROADCASTING ROOM (TEMP)</font>

147
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When it's their turn,</font>

148
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they'll go use the string phone 
by the broadcasting room's door.</font>

149
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinobu, you sure about listening to 
and broadcasting the confessions yourself?</font>

150
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I want to do this.</font>

151
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cool.</font>

152
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, girls.</font>

153
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do this.</font>

154
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

155
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's show them what the 
broadcasting club can do this year!</font>

156
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

157
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wow, this is actually happening.</i></font>

158
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, no!</i></font>

159
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm getting nervous!</i></font>

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But if I can't do this, I have no hope.</i></font>

161
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, we have a visitor already? 
The event only starts at lunch...</font>

162
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes.</font>

163
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coming.</font>

164
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, your confession, please.</font>

165
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Flub your lines, 
and you'll have to do a dare.</i></font>

166
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay calm and keep it together, okay?</font>

167
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Don't prank me!</font>

168
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sheesh... Who was that?</font>

169
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do you think it was?</font>

170
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you able to hear it?</font>

171
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but...</font>

172
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was over the string phone, so...</font>

173
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I CAN'T TELL WHOSE VOICE IT WAS</font>

174
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The morning events have concluded 
with Team White in the lead.</font>

175
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}TEAM RED - TEAM WHITE</font>

176
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll now break for lunch.</font>

177
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The proxy confessions will now 
commence as announced.</font>

178
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Confessions?</font>

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samejima-sensei.</font>

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we have lunch together?</font>

181
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! I am the eater of worlds!</font>

182
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want to make a confession,</font>

183
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">please head to the empty classroom 
on the third floor of the main building.</font>

184
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

185
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here comes the first confession.</font>

186
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"There's someone I've liked for so long.</font>

187
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Shindo-kun from Class 2-A.</font>

188
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been in love with you 
ever since the day we first spoke.</font>

189
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you know who I am—</font>

190
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if you're willing to accept my feelings—
would you please stand up?</font>

191
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all for my confession."</font>

192
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this broadcast?</font>

193
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, this is great.</font>

194
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samejima-sensei might lose it, though.</font>

195
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why don't we go get 
protein shakes sometime?</font>

196
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, that's amazing.</font>

197
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here comes the next confession.</font>

198
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I should go for it, too.</font>

199
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wanna sneak out?</font>

200
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shindo, you lucky dog!</font>

201
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There was a real chance 
nobody would show up,</i></font>

202
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I guess I had 
nothing to worry about.</i></font>

203
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, they're getting all hyped about it.</font>

204
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everybody loves relationship talk, huh?</font>

205
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Curtains closed, Nene.</font>

206
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we let sunlight in, 
it'll reveal the confessors' faces.</font>

207
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oops, my bad.</font>

208
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, this is a huge hit, right?</font>

209
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we awesome or what?</font>

210
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's Shinobu's event.</font>

211
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're gonna be partying tonight!</font>

212
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinobu's plan really worked out, huh?</font>

213
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People want to express their feelings 
with their voice, not letters or texts.</font>

214
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But phone calls can get awkward, so 
we give them the perfect alternative...</font>

215
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with our proxy service.</font>

216
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>"Takahashi-san 
from Class 1-D, I love you!"</i></font>

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno who you are, but I'm sorry!</font>

218
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already have a boyfriend!</font>

219
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn, someone got rejected!</font>

220
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said curtains closed!</font>

221
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, you two...</font>

222
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have anything you want to confess?</font>

223
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh, I mean...</font>

224
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can be something other than 
expressing your feelings, you know.</font>

225
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh, I totally knew what you meant!</font>

226
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do have something 
I can't say to their face.</font>

227
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me, too.</font>

228
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like...</font>

229
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's this one person 
who did a lot to help me.</font>

230
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I butted heads with them 
out of embarrassment.</font>

231
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really care 
what they think of me,</font>

232
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I would like to say I'm sorry.</font>

233
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh...</font>

234
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for me, what I'd like to confess is...</font>

235
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was being really cold to someone.</font>

236
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna tell him that he wasn't to blame, 
and that it was all my fault.</font>

237
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not exactly making myself clear, huh?</font>

238
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah?</font>

239
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you, Iko?</font>

240
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I was voice chatting with someone,</font>

241
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I suddenly stopped talking 
and made them freak out.</font>

242
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanna, um, tell them 
not to worry about it.</font>

243
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello?</font>

244
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to confess.</font>

245
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A visitor!</font>

246
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on in.</font>

247
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. Nobody can see your face.</font>

248
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What's wrong?</font>

249
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was just getting good!</font>

250
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Why?</font>

251
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not working.</font>

252
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope.</font>

253
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll break things even more 
if I try to fix it.</font>

254
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why am I always like this?</font>

255
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always come up short when it counts.</font>

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this rate...</font>

257
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll just prove her right.</font>

258
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh no... I'm going to cry...</font>

259
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything okay, Shinobu?!</font>

260
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girls...</font>

261
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hoo boy... I know the feeling.</font>

262
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The equipment stopped working!</font>

263
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just when things were getting good!</font>

264
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I have no idea.</font>

265
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did upgrade some of our gear.</font>

266
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's conflicting 
with the older stuff.</font>

267
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's the errand boy?!</font>

268
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too bad, but we'll have 
to put the event on hold.</font>

269
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On hold? But the lunch break will end!</font>

270
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only one choice.</font>

271
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll broadcast the confessions 
with my own voice.</font>

272
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be silly! 
You'll have to be super loud!</font>

273

274
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Calm down, Shinobu.</font>

275
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it'll be all over 
if we don't do something.</font>

276
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,510
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Indeed.</i></font>

279
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, where'd you get that?</font>

280
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Oh, I stole it from Samejima-sensei.</i></font>

281
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, a UFO!</font>

282
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, where?</font>

283
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The teamwork between Lemon-sensei 
and I made this happen.</font>

284
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know how long 
it'll take to fix the setup.</font>

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we might as well pretend 
this was all part of the plan.</font>

286
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Broadcast your voice directly from here.</font>

287

00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Yamabuki-kun! 
You always come through!</font>

290
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the best!</font>

291
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Least I could do. 
I'm your partner in crime.</font>

292
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on.</font>

293
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's restart. We're keeping 
a bunch of clients waiting.</font>

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sorry.</font>

295
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

297
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's Shinobu-chan.</font>

298
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I'll now be using this megaphone

300
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The courtyard!</font>

301
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

302

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit, why Mihara?!</font>

304
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's kinda like getting a confession 
from Uzuki-san herself.</font>

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>"We first met up 
in the light music club..."</i></font>

306
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad it worked out.</font>

307
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get back to the waiting room, too.</font>

308
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Where'd Yamabuki-kun go?</font>

312
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it somehow.</font>

313
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another one already?</font>

314
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be right there!</font>

315
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to keep you waiting.</font>

316
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you like 
to confess, and to whom?</font>

317
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>The one I want to confess to is...</i></font>

323
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, which idiot confessed to a crime?</font>

324
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make Shinobu-chan say that crap.</font>

325
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why aren't you in your gear, Yamabuki?</font>

326
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm done with all the events 
I'm participating in.</font>

327
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only logical that 
I switch back to my uniform.</font>

328
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it?</font>

329
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The broadcasting club will be 
even busier in the PM.</font>

330

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm eschewing being 
sorry in favor of being safe.</font>

331
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone shut him up.</font>

344
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it a couple that broke up?</font>

345
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I ran away from you.</i></font>

00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me, Uzuki. I lost my cool.</font>

387

389

392
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,830

400
