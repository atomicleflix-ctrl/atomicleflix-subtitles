00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd you get this?</font>

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,550

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello!</font>

16
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm March!</font>

17
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's be friends!</font>

18
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">March-chan?</font>

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a weird name.</font>

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you. I'm March!</font>

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's be friends!</font>

22
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that thing on your head?</font>

23
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemme see!</font>

24
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it cute?</font>

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mom made it for me.</font>

26
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not supposed to bring 
stuff like this to school.</font>

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mommy said so.</font>

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not? You have some, too.</font>

29
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mine are hair ties.</font>

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yours is just a decoration.</font>

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have decorations, too!</font>

32
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always had these ribbons. 
They don't count.</font>

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always had this on my head, too!</font>

34
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long is "always"?</font>

35
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For 500 years!</font>

36
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">500 years?</font>

37
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar!</font>

38
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not lying!</font>

39
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sensei, one of the new students 
is a pathological liar!</font>

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope March-chan's doing okay.</font>

41
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure she's fine.</font>

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's sociable, and she has Bon with her.</font>

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aiko, the entrance for 
first-years is that way.</font>

44
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I'll see you later.</font>

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go do your thing!</font>

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup.</font>

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">President! Good morning!</font>

49
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi-kun, you guys are close 
with Mizuha-san, aren't you?</font>

50
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't find Mizuha-san's name 
in the new class arrangements.</font>

51
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She transferred to another school.</font>

52
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something about her dad's work.</font>

53
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't heard anything about this!</font>

54
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it was pretty sudden.</font>

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hanna-san, you really didn't know?</font>

56
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No. I had no idea.</font>

57
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

58
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have your hair accessory on, 
so I thought maybe something had happened.</font>

59
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How was it?</font>

60
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like they aren't there.</font>

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe they already moved out.</font>

62
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. They just don't care to answer.</font>

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?</font>

64
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been checking on Mizuha's place.</font>

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never noticed them moving.</font>

66
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good. That means...</font>

67
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Mizuha-senpai's 
birthday tomorrow, right?</font>

68
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to see Senpai smiling again!</font>

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do anything to make it happen!</font>

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what would make her smile.</font>

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, smile!</font>

73
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heya, March! Did you have fun?</font>

74
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this? What's wrong?</font>

75
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did something happen?</font>

76
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bon-san.</font>

77
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, hello, Mimori-kun.</font>

78
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, March, it's Mimori-oneechan.</font>

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She goes to your school.</font>

80
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">March?</font>

81
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, the one Fushi-san was talking about.</font>

82
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His... mom?</font>

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Did you say something?</font>

84
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. What's the matter?</font>

85
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think she's fed up with school.</font>

86
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like me, then.</font>

87
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Fushi.</font>

88
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's March up to?</font>

89
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Making mud balls with Mimori-kun.</font>

90
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something the matter, Fushi?</font>

91
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gugu sent me a message.</font>

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He wants to see her dressed up for school.</font>

93
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, good timing.</font>

94
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was crying until just now.</font>

95
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was?</font>

96
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems she doesn't like school.</font>

97
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She just now started smiling.</font>

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How?</font>

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"How"?</font>

100
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought some water!</font>

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, right.</i></font>

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Attention Grab-no-jutsu.</i></font>

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Something Mimori left behind in her absence.</i></font>

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Something to connect 
someone with someone else.</i></font>

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Something that'll reach them 
even after a long time.</i></font>

106
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Something that'll bring smiles.</i></font>

107
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Mizuha-senpai's 
birthday tomorrow, right?</font>

108
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe I should give her a gift.</i></font>

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday to me.</font>

110
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday to me.</font>

111
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday to Mizuha.</font>

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha...</font>

113
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Izumi-san's PC is supposed 
to have records of Mizuha.</font>

114
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we print them out and 
give them to her as a gift.</font>

115
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a great idea, Fushi!</font>

116
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The password is...</font>

117
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">0406.</font>

118
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There.</font>

119
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want her to at least know the truth.</font>

120
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That all her mother wanted</font>

121
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was not to forget her the way she was.</font>

122
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There, all done.</font>

124
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All taped on.</font>

125
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?</font>

126
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were making a birthday 
gift for Mizuha-senpai.</font>

127
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A special album.</font>

128
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna make it cuter.</font>

129
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got a bunch of stickers yesterday!</font>

130
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks great.</font>

131
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There.</font>

132
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd you come out of there?!</font>

133
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What were you doing in there?</font>

134
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

135
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys look gloomy.</font>

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

137
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, we were just telling them 
about what went on and stuff.</font>

138
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're discussing whether we should 
do something about Mizuha vanishing.</font>

139
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we don't know what to do.</font>

140
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you need to 
let it get to you, Hanna.</font>

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something happened between you 
and Mizuha, though, right?</font>

142
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe what she's doing is more 
important than where she is.</font>

143
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, then?</font>

144
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what Mizuha's up to right now?</font>

145
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

146
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we could at least get her to see that she 
has people around who care about her...</font>

147
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure what we would talk 
to her about even if we saw her.</font>

148
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like we might completely 
lose her if we botch it.</font>

149
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take a simpler approach.</font>

150
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you want to see Mizuha-senpai again?</font>

151
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do.</font>

152
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I miss her.</font>

153
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She might not come out again today, 
but let's drop by her place anyway.</font>

154
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

155
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made her a birthday gift, too.</font>

156
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who dropped this 
in my mailbox, aren't you?</font>

157
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you her dad?</font>

158
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a birthday gift for her!</font>

159
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but I'm sure she'll reject it.</font>

160
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My daughter's already moved on. 
Her past isn't coming back.</font>

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no intention of returning.</font>

162
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are you moving to?</font>

163
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somewhere you could never come.</font>

164
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm leaving with my daughter tomorrow.</font>

165
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somewhere so far that you won't 
be able to play friends anymore.</font>

166
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you understand.</font>

167
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't look like there's any point in going.</font>

168
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He actually bothered delivering it to us.</font>

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's kind.</font>

170
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

171
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dropped something.</font>

172
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought we taped everything on well.</font>

173
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

174
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you remember this picture?</font>

175
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"My beloved family."</font>

176
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

177
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I should go to Mizuha's place.</font>

178
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're way past that. We'd just 
be causing trouble at this point.</font>

179
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crap!</font>

180
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't confessed to Mizuha-senpai yet!</font>

181
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to do that!</font>

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means I'm coming with!</font>

183
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my last chance!</font>

184
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You...</font>

185
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to tell her, Aoki-kun!</font>

186
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

187
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do it, Vice President!</font>

188
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have your back.</font>

189
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go!</font>

190
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

191
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Our guest today is</i></font>

192
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Renril weed removal expert Harumaki-san 
of the Tasty Peach Foundation.</i></font>

193
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thanks for having me.</i></font>

194
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bon-san's on TV again.</font>

195
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one's live.</font>

196
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's famous!</font>

197
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you tell Bon-san to 
stop skipping work at school?</font>

198
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The principal's furious.</font>

199
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah.</font>

200
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you.</font>

201
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Tonari, got a minute?</font>

202
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I left my school body 
in the custodian's room.</font>

203
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you check to see it's still hidden?</font>

204
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why me?</font>

205
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm skipping school today.</font>

206
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm confessing to Mizuha-senpai today!</font>

207
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my last chance!</font>

208
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm helping him.</font>

209
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You get it, don't you? It's an important day.</font>

211
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Fushi!</font>

212
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get it!</font>

213
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back, Fushi. How'd it go?</font>

214
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's by Mizuha's grandfather's place.</font>

215
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably underground.</font>

216
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's connected to where 
Fen and Nixon went before.</font>

217
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we're stepping into the enemy base.</font>

218
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We, the Occult Research Club!</font>

219
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go! O.R.C., fight!</font>

220
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O.R.C., fight!</font>

221
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not Occult Research Club. Handicrafts Club!</font>

222
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this even a club event?</font>

223
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you're coming, too?</font>

224
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was the agreement.</font>

225
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course we are!</font>

226
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vice Principal Yuki's romantic 
prospects are on the line!</font>

227
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you want to come, too, Hanna-senpai?</font>

228
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah...</font>

229
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, this'll be my first 
time skipping school.</i></font>

230
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, fine.</font>

231
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're turning back the moment 
it gets dangerous, though.</font>

232
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir!</font>

233
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger that!</font>

234
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the leader of the Occult Research Club!</font>

235
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's far, isn't it?</font>

236
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess we're taking a bus.</font>

237
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said, I'm the leader—</font>

238
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you take the detergent back, 
could you take this oil tank, too?</font>

239
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, what, what a pain.</font>

240
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't hidden yourself at all!</font>

241
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you need so much help.</font>

242
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's the bow we used to use!</font>

243
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a throwback!</font>

244
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang on, why do you have 
all these weapons here?!</font>

245
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jeez!</font>

246
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is he doing where, anyway?</font>

247
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're here.</font>

248
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should say hi to her grandpa.</font>

249
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. It's an enemy home.</font>

250
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-He's an enemy?</font>

251
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like the sound of that!</font>

252
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grandpa is? What do you mean?</font>

253
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do we really need to come through this way?!</font>

254
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tunnel's closed with a steel door.</font>

255
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could break through, 
but it would take a while.</font>

256
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the entrance to a labyrinth city!</font>

257
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha's somewhere beyond here?</font>

258
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that what you're telling me?</font>

259
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like it's time for the resident 
intellect, Senba Suzuhiko, to shine!</font>

260
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall lead the way using a map!</font>

261
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No Internet connection!</font>

262
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That way.</font>

263
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The far right.</font>

264
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Careful, it's slippery.</font>

265
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you know it was here?</font>

266
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fushi can sense places using the 
roots that he has linked to himself.</font>

267
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you know what's ahead, too?</font>

268
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As far as the roots will reach.</font>

269
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And where the roots won't reach 
is where the enemy base is.</font>

270
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A steel door, huh?</font>

271
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me, the team's muscle, to handle it.</font>

272
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hurt my arm!</font>

273
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay, Tamaki-kun?!</font>

274
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's open!</font>

275
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice, Fushi!</font>

276
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to Nando.</font>

277
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a complete maze beyond here.</font>

278
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every route has a steel door.</font>

279
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't know what's 
ahead until we open them.</font>

280
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like it's my turn!</font>

281
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have just the thing to show the way.</font>

282
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da! The Ouija board!</font>

283
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can use this to ask the spirits the way.</font>

284
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spirits?</font>

285
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ghosts, spirits, anybody, 
please tell us where Mizuha-senpai is.</font>

286
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These kids are always 
playing with those things.</font>

287
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It moved!</font>

288
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Ri..."</font>

289
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're kidding!</font>

290
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"...ght."</font>

291
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

292
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way!</font>

293
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go!</font>

294
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

295
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you thanking?!</font>

296
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An area closed off behind steel...</font>

297
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't this the place Fen and 
Nixon were talking about?</font>

298
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like it.</font>

299
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha's behind there?</font>

300
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's far enough.</font>

301
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need you guys to go back.</font>

302
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?! We've come all this way!</font>

303
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:21,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish you could have met Mizuha, 
but with the entrance being what it is...</font>

304
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think the Nokkers 
would let you through.</font>

305
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the enemy?!</font>

306
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nokkers?! I've never seen them before!</font>

307
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nasty indeed.</font>

308
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be careful, Fushi.</font>

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't forget to have a backup body ready.</font>

310
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Take care of the others.</font>

311
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Bye.</font>

312
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well met, Fushi-sama!</font>

313
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, help yourself.</font>

314
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Mizuha. Fushi-san's here to see you.</font>

315
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your birthday gift.</font>

316
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's belated now, but I 
wanted to deliver it to you.</font>

317
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My. An album.</font>

318
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Want to take a look?</font>

319
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? You don't?</font>

320
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

321
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's been acting so spoiled lately.</font>

322
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What <i>do</i> you want, then?</font>

323
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You want Fushi-san?</font>

324
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, dear, this girl.</font>

325
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There isn't really a "Fushi," Mizuha.</font>

326
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm... What's here are the bodies 
of the people I've met to this point.</font>

327
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that really what you want?</font>

328
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There <i>is</i>.</font>

329
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right here.</font>

330
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're talking to me right now.</font>

331
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Nokker, Mizuha's here 
by your will, isn't she?</font>

332
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The outside world hurts Mizuha.</font>

333
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until the outside world becomes a paradise,</font>

334
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha's mind and soul 
both need to remain here.</font>

335
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha, is that what you really believe?</font>

336
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your true wish?</font>

337
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone wants you to come back.</font>

338
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Including me.</font>

339
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, if I died, would you cry for me?</font>

340
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

341
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar.</font>

342
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've never even cried before.</font>

343
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Of course I have.</font>

344
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean the time you became a sea turtle?</font>

345
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those don't count as human tears.</font>

346
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't trust you.</font>

347
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing you say rings true.</font>

348
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, you're always prepared to run away.</font>

349
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha, I envy you.</font>

350
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been Mizuha since 
the moment you were born,</font>

351
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you've always been 
accepted as Mizuha.</font>

352
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, as Mom's trophy.</font>

353
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not true.</font>

354
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Izumi-san did try to raise you 
as someone she could be proud of.</font>

355
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that may have been upsetting to you.</font>

356
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she loved you.</font>

357
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That much is certain.</font>

358
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Liar.</font>

359
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bullshit.</font>

360
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't even prove it.</font>

361
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can. With that album.</font>

362
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can prove that Izumi-san loves you.</font>

363
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The amnesia induced by the Nokker,
the painful memories...</font>

364
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were always in the middle of it.</font>

365
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she was desperate not to forget 
the days she spent with you.</font>

366
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember this.</font>

367
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of it.</font>

368
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I remember.</font>

369
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think you're doing 
showing me all this, Fushi?</font>

370
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're painful memories.</font>

371
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't have looked at this.</font>

372
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, then, shall we begin?</font>

373
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop it! Let me go!</font>

374
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday, Mizuha!
Happy birthday, Mizuha!</font>

375
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday dear Mizuha!</font>

376
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy birthday Mizuha!</font>

377
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I realize this is a rude 
thing to say to her family,</font>

378
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I don't think Mizuha should be down here.</font>

379
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you back.</font>

380
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you come here?</font>

381
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't actually even care.</font>

382
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No... Why would you say that?</font>

383
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just saying things again.</font>

384
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't it say anything 
that we came all this way?</font>

385
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We worked together to find you 
because we care about you!</font>

386
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop shouting, Hanna. It's annoying.</font>

387
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop deflecting and tell me.</font>

388
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you need to be down here?</font>

389
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, may I ask something?</font>

390
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is Mizuha-senpai seeing a doctor?</font>

391
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not.</font>

392
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pretend I'm a doctor and hear me out.</font>

393
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need sunlight, or you risk osteoporosis. 
It's bad for your health.</font>

394
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't a convincing doctor. 
I'm not listening to you.</font>

395
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roger that!</font>

396
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuha, I don't know how you grew up,</font>

397
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I might not be able 
to support you at all,</font>

398
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I want to do everything I can for you.</font>

399
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to do anything anymore, Hanna.</font>

400
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not expecting anything of you.</font>

401
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... what am I supposed to do?</font>

402
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, pardon me, but I smell 
stagnant water here.</font>

403
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Furthermore, the cake 
looks utterly disgusting.</font>

404
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I recommend that you leave before you 
become stinky yourself, Mizuha-senpai.</font>

405
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's with me?!</font>

406
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all awful!</font>

407
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you be so rude?</font>

408
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ought to kick them out immediately!</font>

409
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think you should do that right now.</font>

410
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

411
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your dream is to grant everyone's 
dreams, right, Fushi?</font>
