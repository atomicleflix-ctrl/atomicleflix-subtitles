00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Episode 7</font>

2
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You fool!
Now isn't the time to hold me back!</font>

3
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan!</font>

4
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a cunning move!</font>

5
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get out of the way!</font>

6
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one can stop us!</font>

7
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, Zhang Chulan.</font>

8
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You win.</font>

9
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd betray the Company 
to achieve your goal!</font>

10
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I underestimated you!</font>

11
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Charge!</font>

12
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is it?</font>

13
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me! Where's the treasure?</font>

14
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is it?!</font>

15
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing here.</font>

16
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's the treasure?</font>

17
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is it?</font>

18
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me...</font>

19
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">my treasure!</font>

20
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still don't get it.</font>

21
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a game of elimination!</font>

22
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ultimately, I am the chosen one!</font>

23
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem pretty familiar with this place.</font>

24
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me! Where's the treasure?</font>

25
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What on earth is this mysterious power?</font>

26
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judy, don't run off. It's dangerous!</font>

27
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Chanon!</font>

28
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So fast!</font>

29
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mine!</font>

30
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's mine!</font>

31
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give it to me...</font>

32
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something's wrong...</font>

33
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a while now,</font>

34
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't heard anything.</font>

35
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too quiet.</font>

36
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er?</font>

37
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er, are you all right?</font>

38
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

39
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really giving up?</font>

40
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, we have no reason
 to stay here anymore.</font>

41
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Given the current situation,</font>

42
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we can't tell if the mission 
succeeded or failed.</font>

43
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were tricked by Liu from the beginning.</font>

44
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, we fulfilled our duty.</font>

45
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't care about Liu's objectives...</font>

46
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't matter.</font>

47
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go!</font>

48
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are we just letting them leave like this?</font>

49
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else can we do?</font>

50
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These people were just hired.</font>

51
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one who's actually 
in the know is Baldy Liu.</font>

52
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Baldy Liu escaped.</font>

53
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan!</font>

54
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you owe us an explanation?</font>

55
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er!</font>

56
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wang Zhenqiu! Xia! Baron!</font>

57
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If any of these three 
touches me, beat them up!</font>

58
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now's not the time for you guys to 
settle scores with me, right, Granny?</font>

59
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this the place, Jinfeng?</font>

60
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing here...</font>

61
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's gone. It's all gone.</font>

62
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's not exactly unexpected.</font>

63
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We had considered this possibility before.</font>

64
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny!</font>

65
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know I've wronged you by 
coming here alone ahead of the others!</font>

66
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I really had no other choice!</font>

67
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to get here before anyone else 
to confirm something!</font>

68
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What... did you need to confirm?</font>

69
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Qi Genesis...</font>

70
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Qi Genesis?</font>

71
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only learned about Qi Genesis</font>

72
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when you Quan Xing came to me.</font>

73
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always pretended to be repulsed 
by the Eight Secret Arts, but...</font>

74
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was something my grandfather, 
Zhang Huaiyi, discovered.</font>

75
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It rightfully belongs to the Zhang clan!</font>

76
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must find out where it is 
before anyone else!</font>

77
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later, I discovered that
 it was created after</font>

78
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">your sect leader, Wu Gensheng, 
had initiated the sworn brotherhood.</font>

79
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought this matter must be 
deeply connected to this godfather!</font>

80
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In Biyou Village, I found out that 
you were the closest person to him.</font>

81
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I wanted to help save you!</font>

82
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe the collection might hold 
the secrets of the sworn brotherhood!</font>

83
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It might even have clues 
to the Eight Secret Arts!</font>

84
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? If it contains 
such an important secret,</font>

85
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">how come I never found it?</font>

86
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you're feigning ignorance,</font>

87
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I believe you simply 
wouldn't have noticed!</font>

88
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because anything left behind
by Wu Gensheng</font>

89
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was already precious enough to you!</font>

90
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wouldn't care about 
the Eight Secret Arts or the 36 Thieves.</font>

91
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only thing you care about 
is Wu Gensheng himself, right?</font>

92
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to have an open 
and honest discussion with you.</font>

93
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But then that troublemaker Wang Zhenqiu 
suddenly barged in!</font>

94
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what did I do?</font>

95
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This guy's had it in for me 
since Biyou Village!</font>

96
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He saw through my plan 
to get to the collection,</font>

97
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so he's been making life difficult for me.</font>

98
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no choice, Granny.</font>

99
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I trust you, but I don't trust 
Wang Zhenqiu and his lot.</font>

100
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to sneak in before everyone else!</font>

101
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny, I'm sorry!</font>

102
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I trespassed into 
your and Wu Gensheng's domain.</font>

103
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never mind. It wasn't you 
who trespassed here.</font>

104
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was those guys who kidnapped me.</font>

105
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the ones who came here to 
steal the Sect Leader's collection!</font>

106
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me tell you, Jinfeng! That bastard Wang is exactly that kind of person!</font>

107
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop having a go at me! Fine, Zhang!</font>

108
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're coming for me, tough guy!</font>

109
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I'm the bad guy!</font>

110
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny, now that things have come to this,</font>

111
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">please tell me: what exactly was 
the Sect Leader's collection?</font>

112
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Clay Figure Zhang, a cicada shell, 
a conch shell, and a stone.</font>

113
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A stone?</font>

114
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, a stone.</font>

115
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A stone from the riverbank.</font>

116
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Jinfeng!</font>

117
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think it's beautiful?</font>

118
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so refreshing and relaxing!</font>

119
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Refreshing and relaxing?</font>

120
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it that beautiful? 
Aren't there many like this?</font>

121
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true.</font>

122
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's beautiful by my standards,</font>

123
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but not by the world's standards.</font>

124
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe a few of them are valuable,</font>

125
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but to Outcasts,
they're all totally meaningless.</font>

126
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you say there were books too?</font>

127
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're just random books 
you can find anywhere.</font>

128
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He even had <i>The Golden Lotus</i>,</font>

129
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he said the illustrations in it 
were quite good.</font>

130
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe there's some secret hidden inside,</font>

131
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I don't know what it might be.</font>

132
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting. The people behind Ma Xianhong
 took the collection beforehand,</font>

133
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">yet hired a group to wait here.</font>

134
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did they want to see us fight?</font>

135
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or did they want to observe 
how those people changed?</font>

136
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang, what's with all this 
black ash on the ground?</font>

137
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was like this when I got here.</font>

138
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

139
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Jinfeng! Jinfeng!</font>

140
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This...</font>

141
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm, these footprints?</font>

142
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've always been here...</font>

143
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

144
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think I haven't tried 
doing that all these years?</font>

145
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, since we haven't 
found anything, let's leave.</font>

146
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er really is a treasure.</font>

147
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's strong, stubborn, and obedient.</font>

148
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang, don't you feel even 
the slightest bit of guilt,</font>

149
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">being in control of such 
a single-minded creature?</font>

150
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would I feel guilty?</font>

151
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She does whatever I ask
 because she trusts me completely.</font>

152
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you jealous?</font>

153
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there someone who trusts you like that?</font>

154
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're angry!</font>

155
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not angry.</font>

156
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're angry! It's the first time 
I've seen you looking like that!</font>

157
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize!</font>

158
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not angry! Why are you apologizing?</font>

159
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would I get angry at a moron like you?</font>

160
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why bother? You set me up 
this time, but I'll get you back!</font>

161
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kids these days are so hard to understand.</font>

162
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay away! Stop bothering me!</font>

163
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just ignore me.</font>

164
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What Ma Xianhong worked
so hard to achieve,</font>

165
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this valley can also accomplish.</font>

166
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, the changes in those 
people were truly astonishing.</font>

167
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The most amazing thing 
about this place is that</font>

168
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it causes people to unconsciously 
practice Zhou Tian cultivation.</font>

169
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As it's not being consciously controlled,</font>

170
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">starting and stopping cultivation 
is also beyond their control.</font>

171
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No wonder they all died like this.</font>

172
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After channeling their energy,</font>

173
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">these guys were like engines 
that never stopped running,</font>

174
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">until they all ended up 
exceeding their limits!</font>

175
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The master of this valley shouldn't 
just teach people to start cultivation</font>

176
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without showing them how to stop!</font>

177
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the Sect Leader.</font>

178
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Sect Leader altered 
the patterns on this stone wall,</font>

179
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">which must be what prevents the 
natural stopping of cultivation.</font>

180
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why aren't they affected 
by the altered patterns?</font>

181
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's those two again.</font>

182
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only the Sect Leader knows why.</font>

183
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But these monkeys are quite interesting.</font>

184
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the strongest monkey 
takes over this place,</font>

185
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it drives the others out of the valley.</font>

186
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These two are probably the strongest 
descendants of the previous generation.</font>

187
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:52,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The offspring sometimes fight to 
the death over control of the valley.</font>

188
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Outside monkeys storm into the valley at
times, taking advantage of their numbers.</font>

189
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they succeed, a new strongest 
monkey will emerge from their ranks,</font>

190
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the cycle begins anew.</font>

191
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These monkeys are learning how to 
be like humans in this valley!</font>

192
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa. These guys got taken out 
by the valley monkeys, right?</font>

193
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it's not at the site of the collection,</font>

194
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then it's very likely it's here!</font>

195
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Qiu, I've looked into every 
suspicious location over the years.</font>

196
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anything you think of, 
I've already considered...</font>

197
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true.</font>

198
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't found it in all these years.</font>

199
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would be outrageous if I 
found it on my first visit!</font>

200
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Zhang?</font>

201
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Has this kid lost his mind?</font>

202
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Huaiyi.</font>

203
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since you share my grandfather's name,</font>

204
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you some advice today.</font>

205
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have experienced
that weird feeling</font>

206
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to be so obsessed with that place, right?</font>

207
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going through there once is enough.</font>

208
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That valley teaches you only one thing:</font>

209
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it teaches you how to be human.</font>

210
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can learn to be human in the valley,</font>

211
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or you can be out here in the wild.</font>

212
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no need to linger.</font>

213
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just a matter of 
the easy or the hard way.</font>

214
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember what being human 
was like in that valley?</font>

215
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Straighten your spine,
vertebra by vertebra!</font>

216
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Experience it again!</font>

217
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although lying down is more comfortable,</font>

218
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and moving on all fours is faster,</font>

219
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's a group of weirdos 
who insist on standing upright.</font>

220
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is a human?</font>

221
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A strange beast that
 stands tall and upright!</font>

222
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's difficult,
but it brings satisfaction.</font>

223
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what it's like to be human.</font>

224
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If one only goes
after wonderful sensations,</font>

225
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">reverting to an animalistic 
state is inevitable.</font>

226
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, so you've already figured it out?</font>

227
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The answer to 
"What is human?" isn't difficult.</font>

228
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking at this valley,</font>

229
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the definition is clear.</font>

230
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One who doesn't cultivate 
can't be called a complete human.</font>

231
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My grandfather taught me 
that the first step was to</font>

232
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">achieve an upright state in 
posture, spirit, and flesh,</font>

233
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">otherwise known as standing
tall and upright,</font>

234
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with a straight backbone.</font>

235
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only then can qi flow smoothly.</font>

236
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This valley and cave clearly 
symbolize the spine and skull.</font>

237
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The corresponding acupoints within likely
hold the secret Wu Gensheng spoke of.</font>

238
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You examined the area symbolizing 
Baihui in the cave earlier, right?</font>

239
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, the entrance to this valley 
should represent the perineum.</font>

240
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's nothing significant here.</font>

241
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like we can't
find this place's secret</font>

242
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without figuring out
what "sincerity" means.</font>

243
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sincerity...</font>

244
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no idea about that one...</font>

245
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny, is there absolutely nothing here 
related to the character for "sincerity"?</font>

246
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

247
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Sincerity"? Like "honesty," 
"genuine," and "integrity"?</font>

248
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you referring to attitude?</font>

249
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Attitude? Attitude towards what?</font>

250
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget it. If Granny couldn't 
solve it all these years,</font>

251
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">no one else here has a chance.</font>

252
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wang Zhenqiu is a pain in the neck.</font>

253
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to beat him to it.</font>

254
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you guys were saying earlier that</font>

255
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the answer to "What is human?" 
is "standing tall and upright"?</font>

256
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. What's wrong?</font>

257
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

258
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

259
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss, have a look!</font>

260
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These valleys are called 
the 24 Heavenly Valleys.</font>

261
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you connect them to
the cave at the end,</font>

262
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">doesn't it look like
a human spine and skull?</font>

263
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that.</font>

264
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't humans stand tall and upright?</font>

265
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what sets us apart from animals!</font>

266
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that.</font>

267
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if some animals walk on two legs,</font>

268
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they don't have an
upright spine and skull.</font>

269
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,610
