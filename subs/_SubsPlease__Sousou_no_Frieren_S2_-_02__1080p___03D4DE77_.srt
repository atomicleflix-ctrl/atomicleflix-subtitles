11

was said to be humanity's strongest.</font>

20
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That seems a bit extreme.</font>

22
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,610

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the time, the greatest 
threat to humanity</font>

24

two either fled or went missing.</font>

28

defeated the remaining three.</font>

30
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His rapid advance was incredible.</font>

31
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In just a year, he annihilated the 
Demon King's front-line troops</font>

32
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and reached the northernmost 
end of the Northern Plateau—</font>

33

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the heart of the Demon King's

34
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was where he was defeated 
by Schlacht the Omniscient—</font>

35
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the Demon King's confidant who could see 
1,000 years into the future with magic—</font>

36
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the combined forces 
of all Seven Sages.</font>

37
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All Seven Sages...</font>

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's insane.</font>

39
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Hero of the South still managed 
to defeat three of them,</font>

40
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he and Schlacht the 
Omniscient slew each other.</font>

41
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That battle liberated many people 
in this region from the Seven Sages.</font>

42

to the Hero of the South.</font>

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,430

44
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">legends claim he's still fighting 
Schlacht the Omniscient to this day.</font>

45
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though, given that the demons he 
fought had a taste for human flesh,</font>

46
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think he was actually just eaten.</font>

47
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we get this cleaned up?</font>

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I refuse.</font>

49
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't defeat the Demon King.</font>

50
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you refused after all.</font>

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As I thought, I don't know the 
right words to convince you.</font>

52
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You speak like you already 
knew this would happen.</font>

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's because I did.</font>

54
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I suppose I can tell you why.</font>

55
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you learn my secret, 
you'll never tell anyone.</font>

56
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I shall tell you, and only you...</font>

57
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the reason I am humanity's 
strongest hero.</font>

58
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see the future.</font>

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. That's impressive.</font>

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't seem to believe me.</font>

61
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that. I just don't care.</font>

62
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then perhaps this 
will pique your interest.</font>

63
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know of the Seven Sages 
of Destruction, do you not?</font>

64
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One year from now in the Northern Plateau,
I will be defeated and slain</font>

65
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,450

and the Seven Sages.</font>

66
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will die without achieving my goal.</font>

67

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you accompanied me, 
my fate would not change.</font>

69
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But soon,</font>

70
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a young hero will visit you.</font>

71
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,200

who will save the world, not me.</font>

72
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will travel with that young man's 
party and defeat the Demon King.</font>

73
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really can't see that happening.</font>

74
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,620

75
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll change your life.</font>

76
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I should go.</font>

77
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I ask you for one thing?</font>

78
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

79
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you meet that young man, 
tell him this.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's ridiculous.</font>

134
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why would the demons 
keep stealing this sword?</font>

135
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Dach family's heirloom sword 
originally belonged to a famous demon.</font>

136
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must possess some appeal 
only demons understand.</font>

137
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, I'm surprised 
you accepted this job.</font>

138
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you'd turn it down.</font>

139
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't have a choice.</font>

140
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Himmel brought back that 
heirloom sword once already.</font>

141
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I'd refused, his efforts 
would've been for nothing.</font>

142
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, Himmel wouldn't 
abandon someone in need.</font>

143
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This village...</font>

144
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's in ruins.</font>

145
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no one here.</font>

146
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, there's one here.</font>

147
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you from this village?</font>

148
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'm a traveling priest.</font>

149
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

150
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're adventurers passing through.</font>

151
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This village was destroyed 
by the sword demon.</font>

152
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was mourning the villagers.</font>

153
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sword demon...</font>

154
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Probably the demon we're after.</font>

155
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Countless villages have been 
destroyed by the sword demon.</font>

156
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There have been no survivors.</font>

157
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How awful.</font>

158
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Adventurers,</font>

159
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will you offer a prayer?</font>

160
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren?</font>

161
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew it. 
There are no bodies buried here.</font>

162
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why?</font>

163
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because that priest is the sword demon.</font>

164
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are no corpses left, are there?</font>

165
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I killed them so I could eat them.</font>

166
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to in order to survive.</font>

167
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though you can eat things 
other than humans?</font>

168
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that a reason not to eat humans?</font>

169
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking to it is a waste of time.</font>

170
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take it down.</font>

171
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's quick.</i></font>

172
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark.</font>

173
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what front-liners are for.</font>

174
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cold.</font>

175
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was an awful job.</font>

176
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we got to defeat a demon.</font>

177
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes difficult jobs like these 
ultimately help lots of people.</font>

178
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I never abandon 
someone in need.</font>

179
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just like taking on difficult jobs.</font>

180
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The challenge is what makes it exciting.</font>

181
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No kidding, huh?</font>

182
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good job, you two.</font>

183
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you get violent 
all of a sudden, anyway?</font>

184
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you were about to pray.</font>

185
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was all I could do in the moment.</font>

186
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People close their eyes to pray.</font>

187
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That demon must have been taking 
advantage of that to kill travelers.</font>

188
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for returning my treasured 
heirloom sword, Ms. Frieren.</font>

189
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now this city is safe again.</font>

190
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to go shopping. 
Could you drop us off at the marketplace?</font>

191
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Certainly.</font>

192
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The graf seemed quite happy.</font>

193
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just hope it doesn't get stolen again.</font>

194
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the demons find it so appealing, 
they'll probably keep trying.</font>

195
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure they will.</font>

196
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was only the second time 
it was stolen,</font>

197
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they've been attacked 
a number of times.</font>

198
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the demons will keep coming 
as long as they have that sword?</font>

199
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may be a treasured heirloom,</font>

200
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but shouldn't they get rid 
of something so dangerous?</font>

201
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that simple.</font>

202
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess not.</font>

203
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobles can be stubborn about 
letting go of treasures like those.</font>

204
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's that, but letting it fall into 
the hands of a demon would be worse.</font>

205
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demons can't resist showing off 
the power they've acquired.</font>

206
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the nature of demons?</font>

207
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A demon went on a rampage 
the last time it was stolen, too.</font>

208
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It destroyed a town and three villages.</font>

209
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously?</font>

210
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only that, but they say 
the demon sweet-talked</font>

211
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">one of the graf's servants into helping.</font>

212
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But ever since then,</font>

213
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Dach's family has prioritized 
protecting the heirloom sword.</font>

214
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps now it's not just 
his family's mission,</font>

215
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Will I grow up to be strong, too?</font>

216
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that of the whole city.</font>

217
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Sure you will.</font>

218
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did the demon have help stealing 
the sword this time, too?</font>

219
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not sure.</font>

220
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:32,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But as long as humans know desire, 
demons will take advantage of that.</font>

221
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans also fail to 
resist their impulses.</font>

222
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that happens, I hope you'll 
help again, Ms. Frieren.</font>

223
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That depends on the reward.</font>

224
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd do it for a grimoire, wouldn't you?</font>

225
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe.</font>

226
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got a good one this time, too.</font>

227
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's great, Ms. Frieren.</font>

228
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of spell is it?</font>

229
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A spell to turn a red apple 
into a green apple.</font>

230
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talk about useless.</font>
