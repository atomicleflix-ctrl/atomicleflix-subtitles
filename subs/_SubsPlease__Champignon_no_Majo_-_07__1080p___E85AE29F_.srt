54
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A mushroom that grew out of 
the sorrow this child carries</font>

55

around others' emotions.</font>

57
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a vessel,</font>

58
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,660

container for other people's poison.</font>

59
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one else can understand 
the darkness he lives in.</font>

60
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That poison, with nowhere else to go,</font>

61
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is what will turn him into 
The End of All Things.</font>

62
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll start being more

the cause of the blight.</font>

80

81
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,070

he experienced during that time.</font>

82
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be a problem.</font>

83
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, there's nothing I can do about it.</font>

84
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that will have a big effect 
on his ability to master magic.</font>

85
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've gotta do something about that.</font>

86

93
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,300

102
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,040

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go and ask.</font>

105
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's a-happen?</font>

106
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,070

that blight without even realizing it,</font>

107

135

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But why do I have to go through all this?</i></font>

136
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,240

143
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And a little bit about the bull.</font>

144
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's your fault for

145
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're supposed to keep it

156
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is there only a little bit about me?</font>

157
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

158
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize! Get up! It's morning already!</font>

163
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,440

164
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has nothing to do with 
how I feel about you.</font>

165
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honest? You know how sensitive I am.</font>

168
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When I asked the crow before

171
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,710

186
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,230

187
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh.</font>

188
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so clumsy!</font>

189
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's Luna.</font>

190
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, listen! Lize is super clumsy!</font>

191
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your recreation idea

192
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,600

193
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,180

194
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa. Ah!</font>

197
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm okay.</font>

198
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, oh man.</font>

199
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,880

204
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I go get some fresh air

205
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man...</font>

206
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,650

208
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,540

209
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to be upset, my boy.</font>

210
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not healthy to keep feelings 
bottled up inside, you know.</font>

211
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mushroom's talking!</font>

212
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am connected to the lord of
 this forest. I am a friend of Luna's.</font>

213
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord of the forest?</font>

214
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you, boy. I'd be happy 
to listen to you, if you'd like.</font>

215
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should get everything off your 
chest and release all that darkness.</font>

216
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Put your hand on my cap and talk to me. 
That should help to ease the tension.</font>

217
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have trouble understanding Miss Witch.</font>

218
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought she was really strict, 
but she also seems very kind to me.</font>

219
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But sometimes I still get 
the feeling she really hates me.</font>

220
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My feelings and memories 
are always so unreliable.</font>

221
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to keep a stronger handle on 
my emotions, but I don't know how.</font>

222
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so confused.</font>

223
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels like the ground under 
my feet is about to crumble,</font>

224
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or a big wave will come 
along and wash me away.</font>

225
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need something... I need someone 
to make a strong connection with.</font>

226
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm.</font>

227
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:51,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I can't really explain it, but 
Miss Witch has some pretty weird tastes.</font>

228
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna, what's the matter?</font>

229
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And actually, I'm not sure 
if I should be saying this,</font>

230
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I don't like her cooking at all, 
and that stresses me out a lot.</font>

231
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything looks really tasty, but 
I dunno, it all has this bizarre flavor</font>

232
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that doesn't match its appearance at all.</font>

233
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, huh.</font>

234
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd cook myself if I knew how, but she 
won't let me set foot in the kitchen,</font>

235
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and there's no way I can 
tell anyone else about this.</font>

236
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

237
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh?</font>

238
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mm-hmm. Don't you know about Luna, my boy?</font>

239
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose not. What would you do if 
Luna's body and breath were poisonous...</font>

240
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

241
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that if you touched her, 
your skin would rot off,</font>

242
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that if you inhaled her breath, 
you would become ill?</font>

243
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would you do then? What would 
you think? Would you be disgusted?</font>

244
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you not want to 
stay with her anymore?</font>

245
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think...</font>

246
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, when I sleep alone, I'm always 
afraid I'll have nightmares.</font>

247
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure I can't 
just sleep here instead?</font>

248
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, as long as 
you stay away from me.</font>

249
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Witch.</font>

250
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What is it?</font>

251
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I want you to hold my hand.</font>

252
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wrapped my hand in the 
new sock you gave me.</font>

253
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that okay?</font>

254

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need something... I need someone

258
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Roses all have thorns, and lilies

259
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,340
