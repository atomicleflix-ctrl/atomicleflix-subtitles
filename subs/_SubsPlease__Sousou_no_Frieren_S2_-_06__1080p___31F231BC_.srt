<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,000

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Silence.</font>

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard those words 
more times than I can count.</font>

10
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, where is this son of yours?</font>

11
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least try telling half-truths.</font>

12
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I received a demon-slaying request 
directly from Ms. Serie.</font>

13
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't know what I'd find,</font>

14
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it seems to be my hometown

15
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bear no attachment to this place, 
but it's still sad seeing it like this.</font>

16
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that you, Genau?</font>

17
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

18
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Genau. Demons destroyed the village...</font>

19
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know. I've already taken care of them.</font>

20
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I killed them all.</font>

21
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the others?</font>

22
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're safe. All of them.</font>

23
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be okay, too.</font>

24
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A newly qualified 
first-class mage came with me.</font>

25
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a mage, but she can 
use the Goddess's magic.</font>

26
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unusual, right?</font>

27
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She'll heal your wounds right away.</font>

28
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be able to reopen your shop soon.</font>

29
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you finally learned 
to bake decent bread?</font>

30
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only been able to eat 
cold, hard bread recently.</font>

31
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to have something freshly baked.</font>

32
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In truth, it doesn't 
even have to be fresh.</font>

33
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd gladly take unsold leftovers 
or loaves like your old failures.</font>

34
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not picky.</font>

35
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Genau.</font>

36
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring the injured over here.</font>

37
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Injured"? You don't need 
to spare my feelings, Methode.</font>

38
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's already dead.</font>

39
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was beyond saving 
when I found him.</font>

40
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The stench is dreadful, isn't it?</font>

41
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His stomach wound was 
already starting to rot.</font>

42
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone like that can't be saved.</font>

43
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he still clung to me.</font>

44
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a baker's son.</font>

45
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We often played together as children.</font>

46
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He took over the shop 
after his father passed,</font>

47
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but his bread wasn't very good.</font>

48
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't get to eat it anymore.</font>

49
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone's together now, 
so he won't be lonely.</font>

50
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why does it have to be them 
instead of us?</font>

51
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unlike us, the people of this village 
didn't choose to fight.</font>

52
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anyone has to die,</font>

53
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it should be the first-class mages 
like us who chose this path.</font>

54
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Genau.</font>

55
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the time the request from 
the Chivalric Order of Norm</font>

56
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">stationed here reached 
the northern branch,</font>

57
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this village had already been destroyed.</font>

58
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not responsible for what happened.</font>

59
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to look around 
the village again.</font>

60
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps you should rest a bit.</font>

61
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

62
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why? Because...</font>

63
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quiet.</font>

64
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of my eyes was just put out.</font>

65
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One warrior and one hidden mage—
no, two mages?</font>

66
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two.</font>

67
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're quite skilled. 
Do you think they're enemies?</font>

68
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, they're probably...</font>

69
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's you, Frieren.</font>

70
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means the other one I detected 
was Fern the first-class mage.</font>

71
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do we have here?</font>

72
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Methode, and one of the proctors 
from the first-class mage exam...</font>

73
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Genau, right?</font>

74
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, there was so much bloodlust in 
that spell, I thought you were a demon.</font>

75
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was there? My apologies for the confusion.</font>

76
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's right. I was worried to death.</font>

77
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern, it's okay. They're on our side.</font>

78
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let Stark know.</font>

79
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

80
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

81
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Ms. Fern also received 
a demon-slaying request.</font>

82
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were on the Northern Plateau anyway.</font>

83
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what's the situation?</font>

84
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you praying?</font>

85
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a problem?</font>

86
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I don't think so.</font>

87
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My village was destroyed by demons, too.</font>

88
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

89
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

90
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demons eat humans, right?</font>

91
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why are the bodies still here?</font>

92
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the same at my village.</font>

93
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows? Not me, at least.</font>

94
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They kill humans even when they're full.</font>

95
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder why.</font>

96
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. The two of you defeated 
the demons in the village.</font>

97
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were a bit too late.</font>

98
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We even hurried here.</font>

99
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's still one loose end 
that Mr. Genau wishes to tie up.</font>

100
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These are what remains of the Chivalric 
Order of Norm that was stationed here.</font>

101
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Chivalric Order of Norm?</font>

102
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We saw them in Norm Company 
territory, remember?</font>

103
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're the trading company's 
military force.</font>

104
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are so few of them.</font>

105
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the standard amount 
to station in a village this size.</font>

106
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even then, they were far better 
soldiers than the village deserved.</font>

107
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was their captain.</font>

108
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was a great man who defended 
the village for years.</font>

109
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised. 
He was far stronger than Stark.</font>

110
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not a high bar to clear.</font>

111
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was the cause of death?</font>

112
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An autopsy spell revealed 
that they were killed by blades.</font>

113
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They all died instantly.</font>

114
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The demons in the village were weaklings 
who'd have stood no chance against them.</font>

115
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The one who attacked the village 
is probably still alive.</font>

116
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good news. You didn't come here in vain.</font>

117
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Looks like there's still 
something we can do to help.</font>

118
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's show it how terrifying 
humanity can be.</font>

119
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like this, this, this...</font>

120
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and then this, perhaps?</font>

121
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are pretty unrealistic movements.</font>

122
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But based on the knights' wounds...</font>

123
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe...</font>

124
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it fought with two swords.</font>

125
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

126
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Typically, demons only conceal 
their mana for short periods of time,</font>

127
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so we can assume it's currently 
outside mana detection range.</font>

128
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the immediate area 
around this village is safe.</font>

129
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Genau told me where demons are likely 
to establish bases around here,</font>

130
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so we'll focus our search there.</font>

131
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

132
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But first, we should have dinner.</font>

133
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't fight on an empty stomach.</font>

134
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This bread again?</font>

135
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll just have to be patient until the 
logistics network is reestablished.</font>

136
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is Genau?</font>

137
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still at the church, I believe.</font>

138
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll bring his share of the bread to him.</font>

139
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, could you tell me 
your analysis of the enemy?</font>

140
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to know their composition first.</font>

141
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll deliver the bread, then.</font>

142
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

143
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what's your analysis?</font>

144
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will take some more time to accurately 
determine their composition,</font>

145
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's something I know already.</font>

146
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Then let's hold a strategy...</font>

147
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, maybe we should eat first.</font>

148
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Are we heading out already?</font>

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. It's time for dinner.</font>

150
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's hard.</font>

151
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure is. What were you doing?</font>

152
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The demon attack destroyed 
the church's barrier.</font>

153
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I replaced it with a stronger one.</font>

154
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The villagers' bodies 
are inside, after all.</font>

155
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, why are you just leaving them there?</font>

156
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help you bury them.</font>

157
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm good at manual labor.</font>

158
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

159
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose someone not from the 
Northern Plateau wouldn't understand.</font>

160
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In general, villages on the Northern 
Plateau don't have graveyards.</font>

161
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they do, they're tucked into 
corners of sturdy fortress cities,</font>

162
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or they're nobles' graves 
protected by barriers.</font>

163
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone else is buried 
in common graveyards</font>

164
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">at the Plateau's southern edge, 
where there are fewer monsters.</font>

165
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They go to the trouble 
of transporting them there</font>

166
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with a Chivalric Order of Norm escort.</font>

167
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know why?</font>

168
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

169
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because if they're not careful, 
the smell of decay attracts monsters.</font>

170
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a hellish sight.</font>

171
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not even the bones are left behind.</font>

172
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a while now, the Norm Company has 
been insisting people cremate their dead.</font>

173
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the kind of rational thinking 
you'd expect from merchants.</font>

174
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree with them.</font>

175
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the clergy have voiced 
their opposition.</font>

176
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand how they feel. Painfully so.</font>

177
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's inhumane to suggest burning people 
who already suffered painful deaths.</font>

178
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's something we'll 
eventually have to accept.</font>

179
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soon enough, no one will be able 
to rest in their homeland either way.</font>

180
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This really isn't how 
eating bread should sound.</font>

181
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels somehow strange 
to be sharing a meal like this.</font>

182
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I never expected us 
to meet again here.</font>

183
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neither did we.</font>

184
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We received the demon-slaying request</font>

185
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while we were camping on the 
other side of the mountains.</font>

186
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really took me by surprise.</font>

187
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's this little guy?</font>

188
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's holding a letter.</font>

189
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you and Genau doing here?</font>

190
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I find it hard to believe two other first-
class mages just happened to be nearby.</font>

191
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Serie instructed me 
to come to the Northern Plateau</font>

192
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and slay demons with Mr. Genau. 
So I'm here on her orders.</font>

193
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't know first-class mages 
had those kinds of obligations.</font>

194
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I didn't become one.</font>

195
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's actually something 
I'm doing as her student.</font>

196
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her student?</font>

197
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Typically, first-class mages 
become Ms. Serie's students.</font>

198
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, 
I heard something about that.</font>

199
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I turned her down.</font>

200
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a good girl, Fern.</font>

201
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's why the two of you gave in 
to Serie's unreasonable demands.</font>

202
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must be running you ragged.</font>

203
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say that.</font>

204
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything, I only wish 
I could be more useful to her.</font>

205
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's so small and cute, you know?</font>

206
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is she?</font>

207
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, you're just 
as cute, Ms. Frieren.</font>

208
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks...</font>

209
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Mr. Genau has been a perfect 
example of how <i>not</i> to behave.</font>

210
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't end up like me.</font>

211
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, now that we've eaten,</font>

212
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">let's hold that strategy meeting.</font>

213
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's the analysis of 
the enemy coming along?</font>

214
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

215
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you learned anything?</font>

216
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. She's still figuring out 
exactly how many there are,</font>

217
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we did learn one thing.</font>

218
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you say the enemy 
fought with two swords?</font>

219
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually...</font>

220
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was our initial theory, 
but it didn't quite add up.</font>

221
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean?</font>

222
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As far as I know, 
most dual-wielding styles</font>

223
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">emphasize a balance between 
attacking and defending.</font>

224
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Typically, one blade is a longsword 
for inflicting fatal blows,</font>

225
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while the other is a more 
maneuverable shortsword.</font>

226
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, there should naturally 
be a difference in the cuts inflicted.</font>

227
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could it be an incredibly strong demon 
who wields two large swords?</font>

228
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did consider that assumption</font>

229
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and attempted to recreate the 
same cuts based on the marks</font>

230
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">left on the dead and the 
field of battle, but...</font>

231
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dual-wielding style still resulted 
in unrealistic movements.</font>

232
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What comes next is still 
only speculation, but...</font>

233
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just tell us.</font>

234
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sorry.</font>

235
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

236
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The enemy wields...</font>

237
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">four blades.</font>

238
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

239
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apparently, it was the natural 
conclusion based on the cut marks</font>

240
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">on the knights' bodies 
and surrounding buildings.</font>

241
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Four blades...</font>
