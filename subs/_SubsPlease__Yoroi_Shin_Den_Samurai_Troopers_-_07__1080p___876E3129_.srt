<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I let my imagination run wild, you know?</font>

136
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you be any more cringe?</font>

137
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How rude!</font>

138
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can hear you! Don't think I won't cry!</font>

139
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, why are we just 
giving up and walking out?</font>

140
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grilling that man won't get us anywhere.</font>

141
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's leave this to Yamato and Musashi.</font>

142
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}CAT, LOVE -MUSASHI HOJO, RHINO BEETLE</font>

143
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There were always about 
ten kids here in our day, right?</font>

144
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, there were.</font>

145
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What you did was abuse
 no matter how you look at it.</font>

146
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

147
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose it was.</font>

148
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had everything all wrong.</font>

149
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried to force everyone into place.</font>

150
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It took you boys leaving 
for me to finally see that.</font>

151
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry about those days!</font>

152
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Ujihara...</font>

153
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Any luck?</font>

154
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He says he really doesn't know.</font>

155
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing, huh?</font>

156
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we did get to make our peace with him.</font>

157
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a big deal for me.</font>

158
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It didn't feel that way to me, but 
there is something different about him.</font>

159
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About that. Don't you remember 
how he used to be—</font>

160
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, doesn't something seem weird to you?</font>

161
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Puppets aren't attacking this place?</font>

162
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent!</font>

163
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A barrier, huh?</font>

164
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some kind of force is keeping them out. 
It's not demonic, either.</font>

165
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who would do that?</font>

166
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could it be the Mirror of Supremacy?</font>

167
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

168
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll just have to search 
every nook and cranny.</font>

169
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That ought to turn up a safe or two.</font>

170
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A safe?</font>

171
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's it!</font>

172
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The day that Yama and I ran away,</font>

173
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we were playing hide-and-seek
 with the others</font>

174
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and tried to find a hiding place
in Mr. Ujihara's office.</font>

175
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

176
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?!</font>

177
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe that's where it is.</font>

178
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Mr. Ujihara?</font>

179
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yama's talking with him downstairs.</font>

180
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You better keep your eyes peeled for him!</font>

181
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know. Gimme a break.</font>

182
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure it was around here.</font>

183
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Found it?</font>

184
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Except it looks like it needs a passcode.</font>

185
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just bust it open.</font>

186
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mirror might be inside.</font>

187
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do any numbers come to mind? 
A birthday, maybe?</font>

188
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Ujihara's birthday?</font>

189
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got it. There was one day 
a year he made us all sing.</font>

190
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}APRIL</font>

191
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why was I smiling back then?</font>

192
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who cares? What day was it?</font>

193
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh, April 13th. So... 0413.</font>

194
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It opened!</font>

195
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the Mirror of Supremacy?</font>

196
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's where it was.</font>

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Ujihara!</font>

198
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Yama?</font>

199
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had him take a nap.</font>

200
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion!</font>

201
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could read all his memories except 
the ones about the mirror.</font>

202
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not Mr. Ujihara. Who are you?!</font>

203
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His spirit can possess 
any living thing he kills.</font>

204
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's one of the Ten Warriors,</font>

205
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anayama!</font>

206
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Correct.</font>

207
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emperor Ramaga won't be too harsh 
with me if I bring him that mirror!</font>

208
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to make you pay 
for killing Nezu.</font>

209
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yama! Shion!</font>

210
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe I let my guard down.</font>

211
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Mr. Ujihara?</font>

212
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real one is long dead.</font>

213
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I drew on his memories 
to impersonate him.</font>

214
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do pity the man.</font>

215
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the Mirror of Supremacy 
hadn't possessed him,</font>

216
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he might have led a different life.</font>

217
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that supposed to mean?!</font>

218
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Three Sacred Treasures have 
the power to amplify negative emotions.</font>

219
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it was the mirror's fault</font>

220
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that your teacher sunk 
to the dregs of humanity!</font>

221
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But negative emotions 
are what demons thrive on!</font>

222
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bring it on! We'll show you 
what we're really made of!</font>

223
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oath of Grace, emissary of Light!</font>

224
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,300
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}GRACE</font>

225
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Armor of Light!</font>

226
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Armor-Gear in your first fight? 
You've got potential, kid.</font>

227
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, right? Can't let Ryusei 
see me look bad.</font>

228
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the Samurai Troopers 
have all assembled, huh?</font>

229
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're here too, Sasuke?</font>

230
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm only tagging along.</font>

231
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anayama, I leave the rest to you.</font>

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mind your own business!</font>

233
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it!</font>

234
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamato.</font>

235
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Relax. I'll send you 
to see him in the afterlife!</font>

236
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yama!</font>

237
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at me, getting played by a phony...</font>

238
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it did help me remember something.</font>

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were really little, 
so maybe you've forgotten.</font>

240
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when we first met Mr. Ujihara,</font>

241
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he was a real great guy.</font>

242
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our memories of "Yume o Shinjite" 
meant a lot to us.</font>

243
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We loved Mr. Ujihara!</font>

244
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

245
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with them?</font>

246
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They weren't in the mood for—</font>

247
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up and join in!</font>

248
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}JUSTICE</font>

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think this is enough to contain me?!</font>

253
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, don't give us this crap!</font>

254
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who said you could just fade away?!</font>

255
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You went and changed 
over some dumb mirror!</font>

256
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How am I supposed to 
gripe at you if you die?!</font>

257
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! You listen here!</font>

258
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me and Musashi went 
through hell because of you!</font>

259
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We cursed you tons of times!</font>

260
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know what?!</font>

261
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You gave us so much more than that!</font>

262
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So at the least...</font>

263
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">let this one thing get through to you.</font>

264
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

265
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He just...</font>

266
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

267
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that got my blood pumping. 
The fun's just getting started!</font>

268
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

269
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut your mouth and watch!</font>
