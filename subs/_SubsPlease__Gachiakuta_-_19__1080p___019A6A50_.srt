<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="20"><b><font size="8">Episode 19</font></b></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt you have anything to contribute 
regarding a plan to reach the Sphere.</font>

5
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me to show you, then.</font>

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Watchman series—</font>

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your gloves.</font>

8
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My coat.</font>

9
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And these boots.</font>

10
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Entries in the Watchman series have existed 
far longer than any other vital instrument.</font>

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The power housed within them is immeasurable.</font>

12
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their owner must have had 
an exceptionally strong anima.</font>

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter how I tried, I was unable to 
create a new entry in the Watchman series.</font>

14
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the experiments led me 
to a whole new creation—</font>

15
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a beast of the Ground, 
powered by a vital instrument,</font>

16
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">only superficially similar to the wild variety.</font>

17
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you've seen one 
at least once before.</font>

18
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to fly there</font>

19
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">on this trash beast.</font>

20
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at him. Creepy, right?</font>

21
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the murderer's son.</font>

22
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, they say his father 
killed a ton of people.</font>

23
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They should lock a kid like that away.</font>

24
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Creepy little brat.</font>

25
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They should throw him into the Pit already!</font>

26
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No kidding!</font>

27
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll break the law and 
end up there sooner or later.</font>

28
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't give them another thought.</font>

29
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They just don't know the real you.</font>

30
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People fear what they don't understand. 
They try to expel it.</font>

31
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once you come to know each other, 
you'll understand each other eventually.</font>

32
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Filthy son of a murderer.</font>

33
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That kid's a murderer, too.</font>

34
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn murderer.</font>

35
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Murderer. Murderer. Murderer.</font>

36
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Murderer.</font>

37
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rudo!</font>

38
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're okay, Rudo.</font>

39
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll get better.</font>

40
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're okay.</font>

41
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take it easy, Rudo.</font>

42
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice and slow.</font>

43
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rudo.</font>

44
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know how much help these will be,</font>

45
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they should at least protect your hands.</font>

46
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...series.</font>

47
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watchman... series?</font>

48
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such incredible power.</font>

49
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The quality of the Watchman series 
truly is in a class all its own.</font>

50
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it seems it's still not enough.</font>

51
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My gloves, your coat, and Amo's boots...</font>

52
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are a series?</font>

53
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A series?</font>

54
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean there's more parts of it?</font>

55
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why...</i></font>

56
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If parts of that series exist on the Ground...</i></font>

57
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>how did Regto end up with one of them?</i></font>

58
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rudo, what you said 
in the restaurant suggested</font>

59
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you didn't know about vital instruments 
before you came to the Ground. Correct?</font>

60
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quite a mystery.</font>

61
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a Sphereite who knows 
nothing of vital instruments</font>

62
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to have a piece of 
the superior Watchman series...</font>

63
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And despite becoming a Giver with it, 
he retains his sanity.</font>

64
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell...</font>

65
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are these things?!</font>

66
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The entries in the Watchman series—</font>

67
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They were all originally used by one person.</font>

68
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having used one yourself, 
I'm sure you've noticed</font>

69
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the bottomless power it holds.</font>

70
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One person.</font>

71
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One person created all of it.</font>

72
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you have to live 
to make something that powerful?</font>

73
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If used by someone 
with all their needs of life met,</font>

74
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:24,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">anima powerful enough to cause madness 
will infect them bit by bit.</font>

75
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've had these a long time... but...</font>

76
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't gone mad.</font>

77
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see that.</font>

78
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We use the Watchman series 
in the normal way.</font>

79
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems we lost an important part 
of our humanity somewhere.</font>

80
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why get down on yourself?</font>

81
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's what lets us access 
this overwhelming power.</font>

82
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you curious...</font>

83
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If someone capable of using an entry 
in the Watchman series without issue</font>

84
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">were to wear all parts of it, 
what would happen then?</font>

85
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To achieve my goal, I must know.</font>

86
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must experiment!</font>

87
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I experimented with making items in the 
style of the Watchman series for insurance.</font>

88
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a failure.</font>

89
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But failure does not mean waste.</font>

90
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An imitation trash beast using my 
failed Watchman series entry as its core</font>

91
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">evolved through offerings 
of other vital instruments.</font>

92
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This has all been an experiment.</font>

93
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fact that I approached you 
with your comrades there, too,</font>

94
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was part of a worthwhile experiment 
to take down the Sphere!</font>

95
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me...</font>

96
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you said we're going to fly...</font>

97
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to ride this 
trash beast across the border.</font>

98
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'll see for sure</font>

99
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who will live and who will die.</font>

100
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The weather report wasn't a waste, either.</font>

101
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a good wind blowing in.</font>

102
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're going to ride this 
trash beast across the border.</font>

103
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This trash beast...</font>

104
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trash beast... Trash beast...</font>

105
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

106
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're inside a trash beast?!</font>

107
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?!</font>

108
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long have you been here?!</font>

109
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hooray!</font>

110
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kaiju battle time!</font>

111
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An earthquake?!</font>

112
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh crap! Oh crap!</font>

113
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait a minute, Mr. Zodyl!</font>

114
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't even started fighting yet!</font>

115
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that? Is your boss 
the one causing this shaking?!</font>

116
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! I bet he's trying to rush me along!</font>

117
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Darn it, this is why 
I wanted you to strike first!</font>

118
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it stopped.</font>

119
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Huh? Huh?!</font>

120
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why'd you start walking away?</font>

121
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't seem like anything's 
going on around here.</font>

122
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to have to find my team.</font>

123
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But c'mon! Help me out here!</font>

124
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-Please don't go!</font>

125
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, um... I'll fight you!</font>

126
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can totally take you, got it?!</font>

127
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here I go!</font>

128
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just wait a minute already!</font>

129
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't do anything unless 
someone tells me what to do!</font>

130
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Zodyl said it's a flaw of mine 
and told me to fix it!</font>

131
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please, I'm begging you!</font>

132
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you please just hit me?!</font>

133
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

134
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until I figure out a way out of here 
and where the rest of my team is,</font>

135
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not going to be in any mood to fight.</font>

136
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you smash a vital instrument really hard 
against a wall, you can probably get out!</font>

137
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're inside a trash beast, man!</font>

138
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

139
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're inside a trash beast?</font>

140
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real?!</font>

141
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know where the rest of your team is...</font>

142
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But do you feel like fighting now?</font>

143
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah.</font>

144
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really, Zodyl, that's sooner than expected.</font>

145
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still have a lot of questions 
to ask these guys.</font>

146
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this shaking?</font>

147
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me...</font>

148
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Dear! You're fidgeting again?!</font>

149
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sleepy? Is the dark 
making you even sleepier?</font>

150
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm always saying, 
that's no reason to fidget!</font>

151
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've already evolved it to the point 
where you're causing a natural disaster!</font>

152
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not serious, are you?</font>

153
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, this is a pickle.</font>

154
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once we're sky high, 
we'll all go past the border together.</font>

155
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I'll get to experience 
the feeling of crossing the border too.</font>

156
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sky high?</font>

157
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah.</font>

158
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The trash beast we're in 
is a vehicle to the Sphere.</font>

159
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a Cleaner. You didn't realize?</font>

160
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

161
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're i—</font>

162
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Fu.</font>

163
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans aren't our specialty, you know?</font>

164
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had my questions about all this, 
but if we're in a trash beast,</font>

165
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I'll have to get my ass into gear.</font>

166
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you people already forgotten who we are?</font>

167
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right now...</font>

168
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get cleaning!</font>

169
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

170
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what is this...</font>

171
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're raring to go all of a sudden.</font>

172
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vital Instrument!</font>

173
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Centralian.</font>

174
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cloth!</font>

175
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, of course! I see now!</font>

176
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The thought of facing a trash beast 
is what motivates you, eh?</font>

177
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That explains everything!</font>

178
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very convenient, in fact.</font>

179
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really had me fooled.</font>

180
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was convinced we were underground.</font>

181
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't think a trash beast 
this big was possible.</font>

182
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to think of it, how have we been 
okay without masks all this time?</font>

183
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought that the bigger the trash beast, 
the more toxic material it emitted.</font>

184
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I can say is that this one is special.</font>

185
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wanna know too.</i></font>

186
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then, we'd better hurry, 
or we're all Sphere-bound.</font>

187
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll set aside all the things 
I want to know and do for now.</font>

188
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodness me. Work's never fun.</font>

189
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then we'd better tidy up here quickly.</font>

190
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you tie him up?</font>

191
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You threw him?!</font>

192
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That boy...</font>

193
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he going to break through the wall?</font>

194
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bro.</font>

195
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Bro.</font>

196
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better stop him already.</font>

197
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the most charming ragamuffin 
needs to be introduced to reality.</font>

198
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Overindulging them is toxic.</font>

199
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real toxic behavior 
is trying to stop your child</font>

200
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when they're on the verge of making progress.</font>

201
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to keep your ears open 
to their progress as well.</font>

202
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The more he hits something,</font>

203
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the more power he drains from it,
and the stronger he gets.</font>

204
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Drain!</font>

205
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the power of Dear...</font>

206
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The power of Centralian!</font>
