00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Black Lizard!</font>

278
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please be okay!</font>

279
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's only been a few days since we met,
but we've done so much together...</font>

280
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">She's the only friend
I have in this world!</font>

281
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">So please, God...</font>

282
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't need Human Transformation!</font>

283
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">In exchange for that, let her be okay!</font>

284
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That's blood...</font>

285
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It can't be!</font>

286
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Black Lizard!</font>

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It didn't get you, right?</font>

288
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Please, answer me!</font>

289
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Black Lizard!</font>

290
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Don't you DARE!</font>

291
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's okay now.</font>

292
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I'm so happy you're still alive.</font>

293
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Like, honestly...</font>

294
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What a relief.</font>

295
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have received 234 experience points.</font>

296
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Shut up, don't say a damn word!</font>

297
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Due to the effect</font>

298
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">of the "Walking Egg" title,</font>

299
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You're my one</font>

300
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">you have earned an additional</font>

301
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and only precious friend that I trust!</font>

302
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">234 experience points.</font>

303
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and only precious friend that I trust!</font>

304
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Young Plague Dragon has gone</font>

305
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">Young Plague Dragon has gone</font>

306
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">As long as I have you,</font>

307
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">from level 33 to level 37.</font>

308
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I don't care if I can become a human</font>

309
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="44">from level 33 to level 37.</font>

310
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">or not anymore!</font>

311
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have received the skill
"Human Transformation."</font>

312
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">For real?</font>

313
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I've finished cleaning the entrance
and the hallway.</font>

314
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Okay, thanks for that.</font>

315
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">But we hardly ever get guests
from out of town like this.</font>

316
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I wonder what they're like.</font>

317
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">We'll find out soon enough.</font>

318
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">This book looks pretty old.</font>

319
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It's about monsters.</font>

320
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I thought you might like it,
so I took it from the library.</font>

321
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Thank you.</font>

322
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">May I take a look?</font>

323
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Of course you can.</font>

324
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A Darkwyrm...</font>

325
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">See the large script
along with the pictures?</font>

326
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes.</font>

327
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">I can't read it, though.</font>

328
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">That is ancient text.</font>

329
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It describes the monster's rank.</font>

330
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The Darkwyrm is F-rank.</font>

331
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Even you could beat it.</font>

332
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">However,
D-rank monsters are another story.</font>

333
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">You have to be a trained adventurer
to have any hope of defeating those.</font>

334
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Moreover, monsters higher than B-rank
are extremely dangerous,</font>

335
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">and only Heroes
and Saints can defeat them.</font>

336
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Is this it?</font>

337
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes.</font>

338
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">They said we should just
go straight inside.</font>

339
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">A Rock Dragon...</font>

340
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">What's its rank?</font>

341
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">The book says C-rank, but I hear
they can get stronger with evolution.</font>

342
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It is no doubt a monster
that would easily kill any normal human.</font>

343
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Which is why I always tell you
and the village people to never, ever</font>

344
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">wander into the forest.</font>

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Yes. I understand.</font>

346
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">It seems they've arrived.</font>

347
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Huh?</font>

348
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">Pardon us.</font>

349
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,000
<font size="40"><b>{\an7}I Became Human and Got Caught</b></font>

350
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="52">"I Became Human and Got Caught"!</font>

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
<font size="40"><b>{\an7}Get stronger.</b></font>
