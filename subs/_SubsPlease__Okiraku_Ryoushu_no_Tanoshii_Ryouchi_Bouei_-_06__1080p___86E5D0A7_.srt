00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How impressive.</font>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They look incredibly sturdy.</font>

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Lord Van for you.</font>

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to your help, 
we finished the ramparts in two weeks.</font>

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In so little time?</font>

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know we helped out,</font>

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm still shocked at what you can do.</font>

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Panamera's "ramparts" 
are jutting out the most,</i></font>

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I'm not foolish enough 
to say that out loud.</i></font>

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll build more houses as more people 
like merchants and adventurers move here.</font>

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm positively envious of you.</font>

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been my dream to have my own land.</font>

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the next battle, I'll just have to earn
 more glory than money can reward,</font>

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and ask for my own patch.</font>

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way...</font>

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are those things?</font>

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ballistae.</font>

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried crafting larger versions of 
the simple ballistae I'd made before.</font>

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You made those, too, Lord Van?</font>

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Top and bottom can fire separately,
so they can loose two bolts in a row.</font>

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khamsin, could you test-fire one for us?</font>

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here I go.</font>

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, they came out quite well.</font>

29
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, over a hundred of them.</font>

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hundred?!</font>

31
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Name your price. I'll buy one.</font>

32
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, but these aren't for sale.</font>

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I'll owe you a favor, Lord Van.</font>

34
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In return, please let me 
have one of these ballistae.</font>

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

36
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well. I'll give you one.</font>

37
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll call in that favor later.</font>

38
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have my gratitude.</font>

39
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How will you transport it? 
And what about the bolts to load into it?</font>

40
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does look rather heavy. 
I'll arrange a carriage.</font>

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bolts are made from iron, 
so I can craft those on my end.</font>

42
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Panamera.</font>

43
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you should take at least 
one or two of Lord Van's bolts.</font>

44
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

45
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take a look at this.</font>

46
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen a sword that shape before.</font>

47
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seems like it'd make heavy work
of foes with armor and shields.</font>

48
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got a sword you don't mind breaking?</font>

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my spare sword.</font>

50
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it breaks, so be it,</font>

51
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but this beauty has seen me
 through several battles.</font>

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be impressed if you 
even managed to chip it.</font>

53
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, if I may...</font>

54
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There was hardly an impact. 
Did he just graze it?</i></font>

55
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very impressive. 
It has an incredible edge, doesn't it?</font>

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van made it, after all.</font>

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What material is that sword made of?</font>

58
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ordinary iron.</font>

59
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's impossible.</font>

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, you mean those bolts are also...</font>

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made them the same way
 I did that sword.</font>

62
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They pierce right through 
two or three armored lizards.</font>

63
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pierce <i>through</i> armored lizards?</font>

64
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, could I have some bolts
 in addition to the ballista?</font>

65
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course. Pleasure doing business.</font>

66
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khamsin, you have my gratitude.
 Thanks to you, I'll also have powerful bolts.</font>

67
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy for you.</font>

68
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone!</font>

69
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run for your lives!</font>

70
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ortho?</font>

71
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry! We couldn't outrun it!</font>

72
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A dragon!</font>

73
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's huge!</font>

74
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll distract it to buy you some time!</font>

75
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use that to get everyone 
back to the village!</font>

76
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They plan to be decoys for us?</i></font>

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But that puts Ortho's party in danger.</i></font>

78
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Should we fight back here?</i></font>

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But that could endanger the villagers.</i></font>

80
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll aid you.</font>

81
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only a matter of time 
before it heads this way.</font>

82
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ortho, this way!</font>

83
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll shoot it down with the ballistae!</font>

84
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today, we'll be fighting a forest dragon,
 a mid-class dragon with no breath weapon.</font>

86
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone escort Lady Arte 
back to the village.</font>

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rest of you hurry up onto 
the ramparts. I'm right behind you.</font>

88
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, ma'am.</font>

89
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte.</font>

90
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for exposing you 
to such terrifying danger.</font>

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe forest dragons 
are very powerful foes.</font>

92
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this time, we have
 our enhanced ballistae.</font>

93
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have Panamera as well.</font>

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}There's no time! Hurry!</font>

95
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might not be able to slay it, 
but we won't be beaten.</font>

96
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right. Good luck.</font>

97
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Till, escort Lady Arte.</font>

98
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you also summon Dee 
and his men from the village?</font>

99
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

100
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is <i>too</i> scary!</font>

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Don't close the gate!</font>

102
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be right there!</font>

103
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Flying foes are trouble.</i></font>

104
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It won't be good if it reaches the village.</i></font>

105
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ready the ballistae!</font>

106
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be sure not to hit Ortho's party!</font>

107
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

108
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, we'll ground it.</font>

109
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aim for its wings!</font>

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about me! Just go!</font>

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on. This way!</font>

112
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. It's not working!</font>

113
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsk. I don't have a choice!</font>

114
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's coming!</font>

115
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry! Thank you!</font>

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it! This is desperate now!</font>

117
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget about me! All of you, run!</font>

118
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right! Everyone, 
head for the ramparts!</font>

119
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?! Seriously, boss?!</font>

120
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the fastest member of our party!</font>

121
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have faith you'll make it back alive!</font>

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you <i>really</i> mean that?!</font>

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone, let's never 
forget Kusala's sacrifice!</font>

124
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll get you back for this, boss!</font>

125
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ballistae, once it is within range, fire!</font>

126
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before it can get a taste of Kusala!</font>

127
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Are you sure you're not
 <i>trying</i> to be mean, lord?!</font>

128
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We can't hit it. What do we do?</i></font>

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm best suited to stopping its advance!</font>

130
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Panamera!</font>

131
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here comes my first strike!</font>

132
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I figured as much. Being valued 
by the count at such a young age</i></font>

133
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and being made viscountess for
her exploits can only mean one thing.</i></font>

134
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's undoubtedly 
a top-class elemental mage,</i></font>

135
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and her aptitude will soon
 become very obvious.</i></font>

136
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire Javelin!</font>

137
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incredible.</font>

138
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not down yet.</font>

139
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I grew arrogant after
slaying those armored lizards.</i></font>

140
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But this...</i></font>

141
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>is on a different level.</i></font>

142
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire all ballistae!</font>

143
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Good. We shot through its wings.</i></font>

144
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Second volley! Fire all bolts!</font>

145
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It read our second volley?</i></font>

146
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We're saved.</font>

147
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We made it back alive somehow.</font>

148
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I won't forget how I was treated.</font>

149
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm glad to see everyone's safe for now.</i></font>

150
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But if we stay here, we'll be in danger.</i></font>

151
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd love to retreat to the village, but...</i></font>

152
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll buy you time.</font>

153
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire Javelin!</font>

154
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not good enough?</font>

155
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that's the true pinnacle of fire magic.</i></font>

156
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If she wasn't facing a dragon,</i></font>

157
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>that power and versatility
would've been devastating.</i></font>

158
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van!</font>

159
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll head back first 
and prepare to intercept it.</font>

160
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. We'll be right behind you.</font>

161
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone! Let's take this chance 
to flee to the village!</font>

162
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

163
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It should've been seriously wounded.</i></font>

164
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Esparda?</font>

165
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing? Hurry up and run.</font>

166
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't run unless you're with me, too!</font>

167
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be troublesome.</font>

168
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just this once, let me buy some time,
 and then I'll head back.</font>

169
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

170
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That should buy us 
a fair amount of time.</font>

171
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He just casually dropped
one hell of a line.</font>

172
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That said...</i></font>

173
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's </i>way<i> too casual.</i></font>

174
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't <i>walk</i> away! Run!</font>

175
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Put some effort into it and 
I'll get you that red wine you like!</font>

176
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Running is harsh on these old bones, 
but I'll do my best.</font>

177
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, I'll stay by Sir Esparda's side.</font>

178
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go on ahead and take charge
 of the village's defenses.</font>

179
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. Keep Esparda safe.</font>

180
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But the village is quite a distance.</i></font>

181
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm running for all I'm worth,
 but it's still so far away.</i></font>

182
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ortho's party is almost fit to drop, too.</i></font>

183
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I need to buy more time 
or the forest dragon will be on us again.</i></font>

184
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, boy!</font>

185
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in position!</font>

186
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Panamera!</font>

187
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mind if I call in that favor right now?</font>

188
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. So? What am I doing?</font>

189
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the forest dragon 
reaches the ramparts,</font>

190
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">use that magic you did earlier
 to pin it down!</font>

191
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, we'll hit it with a barrage
 from the ballistae!</font>

192
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good plan.</font>

193
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, who would've thought my magic 
would be used to merely pin down a foe?</font>

194
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry about this! I'll share the dragon 
meat with you, so please forgive me!</font>

195
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well!</font>

196
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, the meat is on the move.</font>

197
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ballistae, prepare to fire.</font>

198
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it's scary, but be sure 
to draw back far enough before firing.</font>

199
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

200
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I could just buy a little more time...</i></font>

201
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me!</font>

202
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dee?</font>

203
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry we're late.</font>

204
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Deputy Commander, we can't keep up.</font>

205
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, will you three be okay?</font>

206
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It won't be a problem!</font>

207
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have the weapons you made, after all!</font>

208
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Esparda! Khamsin! Hurry!</font>

209
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Retreat!</font>

210
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

211
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We've drawn it in close enough.</i></font>

212
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Panamera!</font>

213
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

214
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flare Blast!</font>

215
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now!</font>

216
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fire all ballistae!</font>

217
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did it.</font>

218
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won! Let's raise our voices in victory!</font>

219
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right, Lord Van?</font>

220
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't hurt, are you?</font>

221
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm fine, thanks to everyone.</font>

222
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte. So this is where you were.</font>

223
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Panamera.</font>

224
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I'm unharmed, too.</font>

225
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank goodness.</font>

226
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You gave good commands, boy.</font>

227
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congratulations on slaying a dragon.</font>

228
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We cut it very close, though.</font>

229
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regular villages would've 
been wiped off the map.</font>

230
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heroes like your butler, Esparda,</font>

231
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Sir Dee, you were too cool
 for words out there.</font>

232
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and Dee, the man who beheaded that dragon
 in one stroke, aren't very common.</font>

233
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm proud to call them my friends.</font>

234
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention, you had those ballistae 
with their ridiculous force.</font>

235
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe they were able 
to pierce a dragon's scales.</font>

236
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I'll need to 
upgrade them even more.</font>

237
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They need to be capable of 
firing ten successive bolts at least.</font>

238
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like you just said
 something terrifying.</font>

239
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, anyway...</font>

240
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now, we need to host 
a dragon-slaying ceremony.</font>

241
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A ceremony?</font>

242
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The most distinguished in battle 
receives the title of "Dragonslayer."</font>

243
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's Sir Dee.</font>

244
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

245
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dee's being made a Dragonslayer?</font>

246
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today, we have slain the lord 
of the forest: a forest dragon.</font>

247
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are here to honor the deeds 
of those who contributed the most.</font>

248
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, over to the head of House Cayenne,
Viscountess Panamera Carrera Cayenne.</font>

249
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The forest dragon you slew today would've
wiped most villages and towns off the map,</font>

250
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and most fortress cities 
wouldn't have fared much better.</font>

251
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet this small village not only survived,
 but suffered absolutely no casualties.</font>

252
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the total damage was a small portion 
of the ramparts and two ballistae.</font>

253
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will now call out the names 
of those who contributed most.</font>

254
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First up is Dee, deputy commander 
of House Fertio's Chivalric Order.</font>

255
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He beheaded the forest dragon
 in one fell stroke,</font>

256
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">dealing the decisive blow in the battle.</font>

257
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next is the exceptional 
elemental mage, Esparda.</font>

258
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Words cannot describe his talent for magic
that let him pin the dragon down.</font>

259
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Last up is House Fertio's fourth son, 
Van Nei Fertio.</font>

260
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

261
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wow.</font>

262
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His knowledge, decisiveness, and genius
are rare in a boy of eight,</font>

263
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he has made 
unprecedented use of his magic</font>

264
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to greatly strengthen 
this village's defenses in a short time.</font>

265
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the battle with the forest dragon,</font>

266
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he took charge and led our men 
to victory as lord of this land.</font>

267
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van!</font>

268
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Lord Van!</font>

269
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van!</font>

270
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Lord Van!</font>

271
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've met people of every status
on my rise from lowly knight.</i></font>

272
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yet has there ever been a man like him?</i></font>

273
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was born into a long line 
of knights in the royal capital.</i></font>

274
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But when my aptitude
 for magic was known,</i></font>

275
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was quickly handed to the county
that offered me the best conditions.</i></font>

276
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My grueling training 
made me wish for death,</i></font>

277
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and I sacrificed sleep to study 
in my quest to become a squad commander.</i></font>

278
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My feats were recognized,</i></font>

279
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and I was made commander of 
the county's chivalric order at 16.</i></font>

280
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After that, I fought in several battles, 
earning enough glory to be made a noble.</i></font>

281
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>His Majesty was delighted
with my success,</i></font>

282
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so six very short years later,
I was given the title of viscountess.</i></font>

283
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then one day, I was summoned 
by Count Ferdinatto.</i></font>

284
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He told me he wished to wed his youngest
daughter to the lord of some remote land.</i></font>

285
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's been a long time, Father.</font>

286
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is her.</font>

287
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

288
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, wouldn't a letter of introduction 
suffice to someone with no title?</font>

289
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In most circumstances, yes.</font>

290
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, even if anything happens, 
you're only dealing with a young boy.</font>

291
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It won't be an issue.</font>

292
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

293
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, depending on what he's like,
 I can just bring her back.</font>

294
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Lady Arte On Ferdinatto.</font>

295
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Viscountess Panamera
 Carrera Cayenne.</font>

296
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear? If he's talented,
he'll become your fiancé.</font>

297
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if he's incompetent, I'll reject him
 for you, so you don't need to worry.</font>

298
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm unwanted?</font>

299
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why they're forcing me 
out of my home, isn't it?</font>

300
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not why at all.</font>

301
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know if you know this, but all 
of your siblings have fiancés already.</font>

302
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the last one.</font>

303
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope he's a nice boy.</font>

304
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When I left my parents long ago,
 I was filled with anxiety.</i></font>

305
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So perhaps I projected myself
 onto Lady Arte.</i></font>

306
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But my fears were all for nothing.</i></font>

307
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After meeting this boy,</i></font>

308
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>the timid Lady Arte began taking 
the initiative to push things forward.</i></font>

309
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This boy is a breath of fresh air
 in a way I've never experienced before.</i></font>

310
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I, Viscountess Panamera Carrera Cayenne,</font>

311
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hereby vow to forge an equal alliance
 with Van Nei Ferdinatto.</font>

312
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>An alliance?</i></font>

313
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Up until now, you haven't had any support
 from the marquis, correct?</font>

314
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you ally yourselves with me, 
I can promise you support.</font>

315
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't have to worry about 
Count Ferdinatto's knights invading, either.</font>

316
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>True, if I forge an alliance, 
I'll replace enemies with allies.</i></font>

317
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It'll also help us financially,
so it's a win-win.</i></font>

318
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You managed to develop this village
 in such a short time.</font>

319
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think you should set
your sights even higher?</font>

320
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forge an equal alliance with me,</font>

321
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the nobles of this kingdom will soon
learn that Lord Van is my sworn friend.</font>

322
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So? Will you accept?</font>

323
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>With my father cutting me off and 
few connections among the nobility,</i></font>

324
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>this is a great opportunity 
I may never get again.</i></font>

325
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the offer. 
May our friendship hold strong.</font>
