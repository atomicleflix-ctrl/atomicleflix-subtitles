00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too quiet.</font>

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And too dark.</font>

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you <i>doing</i>? There isn't 
a single guard in the museum!</font>

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Over.</font>

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, come on. </i>You're <i>the one who told me to
 focus on the search for Mr. Yelle, sir.</i></font>

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Over.</i></font>

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That doesn't mean you can neglect
your guard duties, dummy!</font>

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Over.</font>

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Fine.</i></font>

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll start heading back now, so stand 
guard for me until I get there, sir.</i></font>

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Over.</i></font>

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stand guard for <i>him</i>, he says? Damn him.</font>

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The most marvelous of them all
 has made her entrance!</font>

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And tonight, I am too marvelous to believe!</font>

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Little Red Phantom Thief!</font>

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh dear. Are you here 
all on your lonesome, Mister Director?</font>

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if it's just another worthless guard, 
I deserve a bigger audience than this.</font>

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Q-Quit playing games! 
What have you come to steal this time?!</font>

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An unannounced theft wouldn't 
be marvelous at all. I wouldn't do that.</font>

20
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So today, I come with a warning.</font>

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"On the night of the full moon, 
I shall marvelously help myself</font>

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to the jeweler Yelle's latest work,
 the Blue Heart!"</font>

23
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? What? What? What? What?!</font>

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only fitting for the most marvelous 
one of all to possess that marvelous item.</font>

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodbye. Until the next full moon.</font>

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THE CASE OF LITTLE RED PHANTOM THIEF

29
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the kind of warning 
Little Red Phantom Thief leaves, huh?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}PART 7: EATING WHETS THE APPETITE</font>

31
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne, we <i>are</i> going to
accept the case, aren't we?</font>

32
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

33
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

34
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you already forget 
about the Hotel Pithos case?</font>

35
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Hotel Pithos Robbery?
 Of course I remember that.</font>

36
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the case where Little Red 
Phantom Thief dressed up as you.</font>

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The heart we were supposed 
to be guarding got stolen,</font>

38
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we were attacked by werewolves.</font>

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're welcome, by the way.</font>

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I hadn't been there, 
you would all have ended up in hell.</font>

41
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already told you it all went 
according to plan.</font>

42
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regardless, nothing good ever comes
from getting involved with Little Red.</font>

43
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please! I really need your help!</font>

44
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're rumored to be

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I came to you.</font>

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's our Lord Arne.</font>

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As his assistant, I can hold my head high.</font>

49
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, actually, all those rumors came
from my boomerang security guard.</font>

50
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've brought you another client, kiddo—</font>

51
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective!</font>

52
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My man has disappeared!</font>

53
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My beloved one and only!</font>

54
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please find him for me!</font>

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Without him by my side, 
life is no longer worth living!</font>

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure he disappeared?
 Maybe he ran away.</font>

57
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love is fleeting, after all.</font>

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't say that.</font>

59
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way that's true! 
He and I are in love!</font>

60
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Whoa!</font>

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He even promised to make me his bride!</font>

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What the hell is this lady's problem?!</font>

63
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. I'll go to the art museum.</font>

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

65
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne, what about this woman?</font>

66
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Save me!</font>

67
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll leave her to you, Lynn Reinweiß.</font>

68
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's about time 
you accepted a case on your own.</font>

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Zwei, you're just taking advantage of Lynn.</i></font>

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne.</font>

71
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really trust me 
with something like that?</font>

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I promise to do my very best.</font>

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh gosh.</i></font>

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A-dor-a-ble.</i></font>

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come. We're going with him.</font>

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Why?</font>

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lynn wishes to do this on her own.</font>

78
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not want to get in her way.</font>

79
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, uh...</font>

80
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At a time like this, Lynn, 
some chamomile tea can come in handy.</font>

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It helps to take the edge off 
the sadness and confusion.</font>

82
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, thanks, Zisye.</font>

83
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Throw in some tasty sweets 
and you're all set.</font>

84
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for losing
 my composure like that.</font>

85
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't blame you. 
Someone very dear to you is missing.</font>

86
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's not the type of person 
to just leave without saying anything.</font>

87
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With the Arne Detective Agency on the case,
 you have nothing to worry about.</font>

88
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't thank you enough.</font>

89
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I brought ya even more clients, kiddo.</font>

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hope ya appreciate it, kiddo.</font>

91
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Please find my boyfriend! He's gone missing!</font>

92
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's beautiful.</font>

93
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Looks tasty.</font>

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A leannán sídhe?</font>

95
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're very well informed.</font>

96
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A leannán sídhe is a fairy that's said
 to grant talent to artists she loves</font>

97
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in exchange for their lives.</font>

98
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first director of the museum 
was fond of the following saying:</font>

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Artists sacrifice their own vitality 
to bring their work to life."</font>

100
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"The enduring radiance of that vitality 
is what stirs the viewer's emotions."</font>

101
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, 
that crest is a symbol of art itself.</font>

102
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we have many other wonderful 
works of art on display inside.</font>

103
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way, please.</font>

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll go do some sightseeing.</font>

105
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're in a city of art, after all.</font>

106
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Later.</font>

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

108
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this is the number one 
tourist spot in town.</font>

109
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The four statues in this room</font>

110
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are by an emerging sculptor who's 
already heralded as a leading talent.</font>

111
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to that sculptor,</font>

112
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"True art does not emerge 
from a complete form."</font>

113
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Only when a work is incomplete can 
the imagination of the viewer fulfill it,</font>

114
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and allow it to reach 
a state of perfect beauty."</font>

115
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That one's by a talented painter 
with a very promising future ahead.</font>

116
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Yelle's talents have truly 
been flourishing recently.</font>

117
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please take a look 
at these stunning examples.</font>

118
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is what humans consider beautiful.</font>

119
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get it at all.</font>

120
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Little Red Phantom Thief 
sure has odd taste.</font>

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, regarding that, 
I should tell you...</font>

122
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't even have the new piece?</font>

123
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Yelle went missing about a week ago,</font>

124
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and so did the Blue Heart 
he was supposed to lend to us.</font>

125
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Meaning there's nothing for Little Red
Phantom Thief to steal in the first place.</font>

126
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, the case is closed. I'm leaving.</font>

128
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, please don't go!</font>

129
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the item you want me to protect 
isn't even here, why would I stay?</font>

130
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we can't locate Mr. Yelle, 
the museum will be in dire straits.</font>

131
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, the next full moon is tomorrow.</font>

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once Little Red Phantom Thief finds out, 
there's no telling what she might do.</font>

133
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm begging you! Please at least come 
and protect the museum tomorrow night.</font>

134
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This truly is a city of art.</font>

135
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like your portrait painted?</font>

136
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about a painting to remember 
your visit to the city of art?</font>

137
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not? Maybe we should
have our portraits done.</font>

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way. If there's a permanent record
 of me in this form,</font>

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be a laughingstock
 among vampires.</font>

140
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you already?</font>

141
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a beautiful young lady.</font>

142
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I think I'll go with you.</font>

143
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

144
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Couldn't you have <i>tried</i> 
to look a little less mean?</font>

145
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shaddap.</font>

146
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amy! Nach!</font>

147
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Lynn.</font>

148
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got three clients?</font>

149
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously? Is going missing 
some kind of new fad?</font>

150
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's actually very strange.</font>

151
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All three men who disappeared 
had links to the art museum.</font>

152
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first was employed by a shipping 
company that transports artworks.</font>

153
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second was a curator 
who quit just last month.</font>

154
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The third was an interpreter 
who helped out with museum tours.</font>

155
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is indeed strange.</font>

156
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, there's the warning Little Red 
Phantom Thief left at the museum.</font>

157
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of these mysteries are 
connected to the museum!</font>

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just like you said, Lynn.</font>

159
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The museum seems to 
hold some sort of secret.</font>

160
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

161
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne, I'd like to join you
 at the museum tomorrow.</font>

162
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Lynn Reinweiß. Tomorrow, 
you'll investigate this Yelle fellow.</font>

163
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the full moon's tomorrow.</font>

164
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be devastated if I'm not there
 for the showdown</font>

165
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">between you and the marvelous 
Little Red Phantom Thief!</font>

166
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was planning to be there
 to cheer you on.</font>

167
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheer on?</font>

168
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Absolutely do <i>not</i> come to 
the art museum. That's an order.</font>

169
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so selfish, Lord Arne!</font>

170
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's the selfish one?</font>

171
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You demon! You devil!</font>

172
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yes, not far off. 
I <i>am</i> a vampire, after all.</font>

173
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Mr. Yelle have any family?</font>

174
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I first rented this place out 
to him, he said he had no one.</font>

175
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

176
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be him.</font>

177
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He looked much healthier back then.</font>

178
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd lost a lot of weight recently, you see.</font>

179
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was worried he may have 
been working too hard.</font>

180
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said he was working on his magnum opus.</font>

181
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He sure seemed excited about it.</font>

182
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His magnum opus, you say?</font>

183
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I also think he said he was 
making it for someone special.</font>

184
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For someone special?</font>

185
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought maybe he'd fallen 
in love with someone.</font>

186
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But where would he have run off to?</font>

187
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd lost weight?</font>

188
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So much so, the landlord had
started worrying about him.</font>

189
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For living creatures, 
humans sure are weaklings.</font>

190
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Weaklings," huh?</font>

191
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weak... Ill...</font>

192
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hospital!</font>

193
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Mr. Yelle actually <i>was</i> sick, 
maybe he went to a hospital.</font>

194
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent reasoning, Lynn.</font>

195
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll ask about the other three men, too.</font>

196
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that was a waste of time.</font>

197
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it wasn't a waste.</font>

198
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least we've ruled out 
a few places they <i>didn't</i> go.</font>

200
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look.</font>

201
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

202
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This would look nice on you.</font>

203
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, it's so cute. I love these.</font>

204
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. Looks like it has paint inside.</font>

205
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a pretty color.</font>

206
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Find something you like?</font>

207
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are said to ward off evil, miss.</font>

208
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ward off evil?</font>

209
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Nach.</font>

210
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really does ward off evil.</font>

211
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, you dummy! 
It just surprised me a little!</font>

212
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A little?</font>

213
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having something shoved in your face
 would surprise anyone!</font>

214
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take it.</font>

215
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

216
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excellent choice.</font>

217
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

218
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I smell something sweet.</font>

219
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's very faint, though.</font>

220
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zisye?</font>

221
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up, Little Red?</font>

222
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only person you saw here 
was the jeweler, right?</font>

223
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. After I heard you were 
gonna steal the Blue Heart,</font>

224
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I peeked in every once in a while,
 but Yelle was always alone.</font>

225
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or at least, he was the only person
 reflected in the mirror.</font>

226
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He could have been living 
with a vampire or something.</font>

227
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But vampires smell like blood, 
and it doesn't smell like blood in here.</font>

228
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a faintly sweet smell
 in the air instead.</font>

229
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what are you planning to do tonight?</font>

230
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't find anything at the museum.</font>

231
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's true.</font>

232
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I believe Mister Vampire will be 
waiting for me at the museum all the same.</font>

233
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He did say that in front of me, 
so I think he intended for you to find out.</font>

234
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I guess it'd be rude
 to stand him up, wouldn't it?</font>

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It might be a trap, though.</font>

236
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A trap?</font>

237
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss, want your portrait painted?</font>

238
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, but no thank you.</font>

239
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Want a portrait?</font>

240
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I'm in a hurry, but maybe next time.</font>

241
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Mr. Yelle!</font>

242
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know him, miss?</font>

243
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh, yes.</font>

244
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, would you mind taking that to him?</font>

245
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

246
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He commissioned me to draw his portrait
 about three weeks ago.</font>

247
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A little to your left, please.</i></font>

248
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, I think I'm fine here.</i></font>

249
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He paid quite a lot of money for it, too.</font>

250
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I asked him to come and 
pick it up in a few weeks.</font>

251
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it a lovely expression?</font>

252
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, he appears very happy.</font>

253
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he hasn't come to get it yet,
 so I don't know what to do.</font>

254
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's odd he never came to pick up
 this painting he commissioned.</font>

255
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something very strange is going on.</font>

256
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps there is more to 
his disappearance than it seems.</font>

257
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, we still have work to do
 to find the missing men.</font>

258
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on out, Little Red Phantom Thief!</font>

259
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really think she'll show?</font>

260
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can bet on it!</font>

261
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This sort of thrilling situation is right up
 Little Red Phantom Thief's alley!</font>

262
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's over there!</font>

263
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She got me!</font>

264
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Little Red Phantom Thief

266
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you witness my marvelous jump
 just now, Mister Vampire?</font>

267
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Little Red! What have you done
 with the director?</font>

268
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The museum director is right over there.</font>

269
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir!</font>

270
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, turn your attention to this.</font>

271
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, it can't be.</font>

272
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the Blue Heart?!</font>

273
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it is, what are you gonna do about it?</font>

274
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, you are about the only person capable 
of joining me in a marvelous dance.</font>

275
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dance, you say?</font>

276
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ridiculous. Now, hand it over.</font>

277
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not giving it to you.</font>

278
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give it here.</font>

279
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want it, you're gonna
have to take it from me.</font>

280
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tch. Uh, wait. Now how did I...</font>

281
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, like this.</font>

282
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne!</font>

283
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I told you 
to stay away, Lynn Rein—</font>

284
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm rooting for you, Lord Arne!</font>

285
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Evilly! Bloody! Fantastic! Neuntöte!</font>

286
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Evilly! Bloody! Fantastic! Neuntöte!</font>

287
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Evilly! Bloody! Fantastic! Neuntöte!</font>

288
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Evilly! Bloody! Fantastic! Neuntöte!</font>

289
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Evilly! Bloody! Fantastic! Neuntöte!</font>

290
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Evilly! Bloody! Fantastic! Neuntöte!</font>

291
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've suddenly lost interest.</font>

292
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems our marvelous dance has ended.</font>

293
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is but an imitation.</font>

294
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I came here today to deliver
 another marvelous warning.</font>

295
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unfortunately for you, 
I've had to change my plans.</font>

296
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will locate the missing Mister Yelle 
before you even have a chance,</font>

297
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and take the Blue Heart for myself!</font>

298
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And on that note, Mister Vampire, 
I bid you a marvelous farewell.</font>

299
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have located the missing humans.</font>

300
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

301
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or more accurately, I have located 
the corpses of the missing humans.</font>

302
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The corpses?</font>

303
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're here.</font>

304
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

305
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mere statues would not 
be able to move like this.</font>
