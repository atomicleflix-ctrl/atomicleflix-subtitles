00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,990

00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, "Lake Van"? 
How'd it get that name?</font>

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The villagers named it that to honor

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hero, you have my permission.</font>

76
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may marry my daughter, Lada Priora.</font>

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-Marry?!</font>

79
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does the arrangement dissatisfy you?</font>

83
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lada Priora is still a child.</font>

84
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think she understands 
what you're suggesting.</font>

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why <i>are</i> you offering her hand in marriage?
Is there a reason behind it?</font>

86
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until now, my people have 
avoided making ties with humans,</font>

87
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but in recent years, armored lizards

89
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,320

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish to secure a place

93
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, the marriage

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll protect your tribe,

97
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,810

98
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

99
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, we shall settle here.</font>

100
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, since that's settled, 
let's get building.</font>

101
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What incredible magic.</font>

102
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a rest area. 
Everyone can use it at their leisure.</font>

103
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's very spacious and seems

104
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,590

105
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,080

107
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's right.</font>

108
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you going to do?</font>

109
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you see, I've placed sewer pipes 
underneath the buildings in the village.</font>

110
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We regularly send water from the moat

111
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,870

112
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Then, let us help you.</font>

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You don't mind?</font>

114
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We excel at working in the water.</font>

115
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much.</font>

116
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, we're opening it now.</font>

117
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That went well, thanks to your help.</font>

118
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you do that every day?</font>

119
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Several times a day, in fact.</font>

120
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

121
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, allow us to take on the task
 of handling this "sewage."</font>

122
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean it?</font>

123
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Consider it thanks
for letting us live here.</font>

124
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That'd be a huge help.</font>

125
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Lord Van.</font>

126
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you are.</font>

127
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you up—</font>

128
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Those are apkallu!</font>

129
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen one before.</font>

130
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Son-in-law, you have my gratitude 
for your kind welcome.</font>

131
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Son-in-law?</font>

132
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely not. You married an apkallu?</font>

133
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, no, I haven't—</font>

134
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, I'm Van's wife.</font>

135
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Van is my husband.</font>

136
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lada Priora?!</font>

137
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you later, husband.</font>

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte, sorry for calling you
 out here so early.</font>

139
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just thought it might be nice 
to take in the morning air on the lake.</font>

140
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's fine. I like taking in the 
morning air, too. It's very refreshing.</font>

141
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad to hear it.</font>

142
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, about that apkallu from yesterday...</font>

143
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard the story from Panamera.</font>

144
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds like we both misunderstood.</font>

145
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's right.</font>

146
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions.</font>

147
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy that's ironed out.</font>

148
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You built this lake and developed 
the village so much. You're incredible.</font>

149
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. It was all thanks 
to everyone else helping me.</font>

150
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, husband.</font>

151
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lada Priora?</font>

152
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you?</font>

153
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? My name is Arte.</font>

154
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, we were just having 
a private conversation—</font>

155
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey! It's the meat man!</font>

156
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't call him that. He's the lord.</font>

157
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord!</font>

159
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Meat man!</font>

160
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that's dangerous.</font>

161
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Lord!</font>

162
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Husband, are you all right?</font>

163
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Husband"?</font>

164
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I explained to your father 
that we're not engaged.</font>

165
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He just bullied Lada Priora.</font>

166
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

167
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, wait...</font>

168
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Everyone, rock the boat!</font>

169
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yay!</font>

170
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you some meat, so just stop!</font>

171
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hooray!</font>

172
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is scary!</font>

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Meat, please.</font>

174
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seriously, stop it!</font>

175
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We love Van!</font>

176
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Scary. Too scary.</i></font>

177
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Son-in-law. Lada Priora 
told me all about it.</font>

178
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were flirting with another woman 
when you already have my daughter?</font>

179
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You mean <i>me</i>?</font>

180
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, first of all, I'm not her husband—</font>

181
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We will hold a competition.</font>

182
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

183
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will compete against my people,</font>

184
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and if we win, you will officially 
recognize your betrothal to my daughter.</font>

185
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?</i></font>

186
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We accept your challenge!</font>

187
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dee?</font>

188
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me, the Chivalric Order's 
deputy commander. I'll bring you victory!</font>

189
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Settling this quickly might let you
focus more on your studies, it's true.</font>

190
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? This sounds interesting, Lord Van.</font>

191
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if I lose—</font>

192
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right.</font>

193
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd never lose, Lord Van.</font>

194
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two are too biased toward me.</font>

195
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, shall we settle this 
with a three-round competition?</font>

196
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

197
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You may choose the nature of 
the first contest, son-in-law.</font>

198
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm, what should it be?</font>

199
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So if you land this ball in your 
opponent's zone, you score a point.</font>

200
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never seen nor heard
 of such a sport.</font>

201
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, Lord Van. You know something
 even Sir Esparda doesn't.</font>

202
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What incredible knowledge.</font>

203
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I mean, it's just volleyball.</i></font>

204
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That aside, these swimsuits you made
 for us are very comfortable.</font>

205
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Aw, yeah.</font>

206
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Panamera is what 
every woman aspires to be.</font>

207
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're joining our side?</font>

208
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

209
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need Lord Van to get engaged 
to Lady Arte, after all.</font>

210
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Lady Arte?</font>

211
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Good luck, you two!</font>

212
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You can do it!</font>

213
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good luck, you two!</font>

214
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks!</font>

215
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Bring it!</font>

216
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? They might be too good at this.</font>

217
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're getting crushed.</font>

218
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is impossible.</font>

219
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that the extent of your passion?</font>

220
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you give up, it's game over.</font>

221
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the tears spring forth.</font>

222
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a girl, after all.</font>

223
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fight on!</font>

224
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's futile! Take this!</font>

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make sure to keep it alive!</font>

226
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll place everyone's hopes
 into this ball!</font>

227
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'll score!</font>

228
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We did it!</font>

229
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice smash.</font>

230
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, the real match starts now.</font>

231
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here I go!</font>

233
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There!</font>

234
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weak!</font>

235
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We clawed them back. It's now level.</font>

236
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's match point.</font>

237
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The next one to score wins.</font>

238
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have this!</font>

239
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it!</font>

240
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the end!</font>

241
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't let you!</font>

242
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

243
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won.</font>

244
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have to start over from nothing.</font>

245
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's some sports anime
 happening over here.</font>

247
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then, son-in-law.</font>

248
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will decide on the next event.</font>

249
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. What will it be?</font>

250
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Swimming.</font>

251
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Swimming?</font>

252
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The contest will be a two-person relay.</font>

253
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is bad. If we lose one more event, 
I have to marry Lada Priora.</i></font>

254
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But the apkallu are master swimmers.</i></font>

255
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me.</font>

256
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dee? Can you swim?</font>

257
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

258
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I'll join him.</font>

259
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, too, Khamsin? Will you be okay?</font>

260
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'll give my all for your sake.</font>

261
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ready.</font>

262
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah! She's fast from the very start!</font>

263
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If their lead grows any bigger, 
we're done for.</font>

264
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Khamsin caught up to her!</font>

265
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What tenacity.</font>

266
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it, Khamsin!</font>

267
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daughter, hurry!</font>

268
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

269
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take it from here.</font>

270
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did well.</font>

271
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, leave it to me!</font>

272
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why the butterfly stroke?</font>

273
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir Dee is at his fastest 
when he swims like that.</font>

274
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That stroke lets him use 
his steel-like muscles to the fullest.</font>

275
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How is that man doing that?</font>

276
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won!</font>

277
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You did it!</font>

278
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're kidding me.</font>

279
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that Dee's?</font>

280
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van, I did it!</font>

281
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I cannot believe we lost at swimming.</font>

282
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, there is still one event left.</font>

283
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Son-in-law, decide on the final event.</font>

284
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

285
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

286
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pluriel, could I ask you 
to produce some ice?</font>

287
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

288
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

289
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There we go.</font>

290
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da.</font>

291
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa.</font>

292
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what are we doing with this?</font>

293
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a shaved ice speed-eating contest.</font>

294
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll compete in teams of two. I'll take
 part this time, so I'll need a teammate.</font>

295
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Would it be all right 
for me to participate?</font>

296
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I make these too big?</font>

297
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte, are you really doing this? 
It's not too late to trade places.</font>

298
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'll be okay.</font>

299
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, let's begin.</font>

300
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ready!</font>

301
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My head...</font>

302
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It stings!</font>

303
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is for my daughter. 
I can't afford to lose!</font>

304
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah.</font>

305
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We might be done for.</font>

306
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte! Don't force yourself!</font>

307
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, Lord Van's incredible!</font>

308
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Arte is, too.</font>

309
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't lose!</font>

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

311
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who will win?</font>

312
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much!</font>

313
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van's team wins!</font>

314
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We lost.</font>

315
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a good competition.</font>

316
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

317
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we can stop all this talk
 of marrying Lada Priora.</font>

318
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've taken an even greater liking
 to you, son-in-law.</font>

319
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You truly are a man 
worthy of my daughter.</font>

320
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Then, what was
 the point of winning?</font>

321
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Continue to take good care
 of my daughter.</font>

322
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Farewell, "son-in-law."</font>

323
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way.</font>

324
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Van?</font>

325
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter?</font>

326
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">M-My stomach hurts from 
eating too much shaved ice.</font>

327
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, my. That's terrible.</font>

328
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You worked hard out there.</font>

329
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you won, though.</font>

330
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a good competition.</font>

331
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did well, too, Lady Arte.</font>

332
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thanks.</font>
