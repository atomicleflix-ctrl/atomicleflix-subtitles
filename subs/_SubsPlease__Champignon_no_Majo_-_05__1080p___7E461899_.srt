00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

131
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She is a wonderful individual.</font>

132
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to her, I finally got 
to visit this bookstore today.</font>

133
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She keeps doing nice things for me. 
I think she is a very kind person.</font>

134
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. "Kind" isn't a word that comes 
to mind when I think of the Cat Witch.</font>

135
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Starting around then, whenever the 
Cat Witch was showered in compliments</i></font>

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>such as "kind" or "nice,"</i></font>

137
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>she'd get a blissful 
expression on her face,</i></font>

138
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>as if she was under some kind of spell.</i></font>

139
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In time, she started to visit 
the mushroom house more often</i></font>

140
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>in order to get another helping of 
this new and still unfamiliar feeling.</i></font>

141
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna, aren't you glad she's lending 
you the book you wanted to read?</font>

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The birds in town were singing, "the 
Cat Witch has a twisted, evil soul,"</font>

143
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that isn't true at all, is it?</font>

144
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a kind witch, and she's been 
coming to visit us a bunch recently,</font>

145
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so every day has been lots of fun.</font>

146
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was as if these 
unadulterated showers of praise</i></font>

147
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>yanked the teeth out of 
the witch's cruel bite.</i></font>

148
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, Luna has a poison body because 
she was once a cursed youngling,</font>

149
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it's also because she absorbs 
and cleans poison from the world.</font>

150
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you know that?</font>

151
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All these people who talk trash about 
her don't even care. It's unbelievable!</font>

152
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're the worst! They don't
even try to get to know her.</font>

153
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She should try saying all 
this to her old self.</font>

154
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's more likely to cast a spell 
to forget her bad behavior.</font>

155
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before, all the trees and animals of this 
black forest were contaminated with poison</font>

156
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it was home to all sorts 
of pests and evil spirits.</font>

157
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But once you moved here,</font>

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it changed from a black forest 
to a poison mushroom forest.</font>

159
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can feel safe letting 
my cats play here now.</font>

160
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it sounds kind of impersonal 
when you call me "Miss Dorothy."</font>

161
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just call me "Dorothy" 
as if I was your sister.</font>

162
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, that came out of nowhere.</i></font>

163
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... Dor... Sis... Miss Witch? Um...</font>

164
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, this is what happens with someone 
who's not comfortable with people.</font>

165
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you tell me why you decided 
to become a cat witch?</font>

166
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's simple. Obviously 
because I love cats so much!</font>

167
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wasn't it the same for you,
 with mushrooms?</font>

168
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is such a nice place, 
though. But did you know?</font>

169
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say there's also a legendary 
cat forest that only cats live in.</font>

170
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes, the more distinguished cat 
witches even get invitations to visit.</font>

171
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A cat forest...</i></font>

172
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really want to go see it myself, but 
I guess because I'm still inexperienced,</font>

173
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the forest's chief won't
 give me permission.</font>

174
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shucks, why am I not good enough?</font>

175
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dorothy? Not her. Furr-get it. 
She's hiss-terically loud.</font>

176
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's a blabber-meowth. A real purr-oblem.</font>

177
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I see what you mean meow.</font>

178
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can imagine what it's like 
from what these guys have told me.</font>

179
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Almost like I've been there before.</font>

180
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In fact, I bet I used to live 
there as a cat in a past life.</font>

181
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, I hope I can visit
 the cat forest soon.</font>

182
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know what my dream in life is?</font>

183
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's to put this silly, poisoned world 
behind me, move to the cat forest</font>

184
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where nobody hassles me and 
I can be with the cats I love</font>

185
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and live there happily ever after.</font>

186
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that was what I always wanted, 
until I met this Champignon Witch,</font>

187
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who fights so bravely to 
rid the world of poison.</font>

188
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that I've seen how pretty 
the black forest has become,</font>

189
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as your big sister and 
senior as a black witch,</font>

190
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see I still have 
a lot of work to do.</font>

191
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}That said, our job is actually espionage.</font>

192
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The cat forest. A homeland 
she has not yet seen.</i></font>

193
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Espionage?</font>

194
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But she cannot return to 
the cat forest just yet.</i></font>

195
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Cats aren't poisonous animals, so instead 
of purifying like poison witches...</font>

196
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dorothy, the tabby who got 
into the white witch's castle</font>

197
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has been missing for two days meow!</font>

198
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet mew they caught her!</font>

199
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many does that make meow?</font>

200
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What meow?</font>

201
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now what do we mew?</font>

202
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The tabby's dead fur sure! There's 
no point trying to save him meow!</font>

203
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't know for sure yet.</font>

204
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But either way, if they 
suspect us of spying now,</font>

205
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">all of the cats and I are 
in danger of being purged!</font>

206
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's also several black witches in the 
castle who are being unjustly detained!</font>

207
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sisi, you guys need to get away!</font>

208
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go tell the master and our 
friends what's happening here!</font>

209
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll use the confusion 
to sneak into the castle,</font>

210
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">rescue the tabby and other cats, and give
 the white witches a little surprise!</font>

211
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Dorothy! It's too dangerous!</font>

212
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to distract them 
so everyone can get away.</font>

213
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be all right, Sisi. I'm not afraid.</font>

214
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I remember what she said...</font>
