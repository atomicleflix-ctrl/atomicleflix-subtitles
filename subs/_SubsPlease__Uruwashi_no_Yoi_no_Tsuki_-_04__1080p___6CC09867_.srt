00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that actually "love"?</font>

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But isn't this "experiment" 
to figure that out?</font>

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But...</font>

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now. Let's just chill 
and take it easy, yeah?</font>

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. I have something you'll like.</font>

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, you haven't even 
said, "I like you" yet!</font>

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her face just now...</font>

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was priceless.</font>

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's probably because of...</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, was it the nurse's office?</i></font>

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, before then.</i></font>

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why...</font>

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We often know ourselves the least.</i></font>

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's almost like...</i></font>

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I </i>want<i> Senpai to fall in love with me.</i></font>

29
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I asked you this before...</font>

30
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,810

32
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was the dumbass for asking.</font>

33
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know why,
but I always want to look at her.</font>

34
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And when I do, I can't

35
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,320

36
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,340

37
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, man!</font>

38
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, what do you call it?</font>

39
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm like a Yoi-chan enthusiast, 
or a fanatic or something.</font>

40
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know, I've been thinking about it.</font>

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that what people 
call love at first sight?</font>

42
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And an intense case, at that.</font>

43
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

44
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, is that not it?</font>

45
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always thought that's what it was.</font>

46
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because if you can't
keep your eyes off her,</font>

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's gotta be love.</font>

48
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love.</font>

49
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Seriously? What part?</font>

50
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I really gushing to you 
guys all the time?</font>

51
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More like leaving us on read. And unread. 
And generally ignoring us.</font>

52
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What I'm saying is,</font>

53
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the way you're treating her is totally 
different from the girls you've dated.</font>

54
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I thought this time you 
might seriously be in love, Ichi.</font>

55
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Seriously in love?</font>

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can you tell?</font>

57
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, even I don't 
know that much about it.</font>

58
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You could probably figure it out 
if you gave it a little thought.</font>

59
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of clueless Prince are you?</font>

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, you haven't even

thought when I said it.</i></font>

67
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's not like that's even what I 
wanted to say.</i></font>

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why can't I ever be honest?</i></font>

69
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,170

a little cuter.</i></font>

70
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I mean, because I'm a girl, of course!</i></font>

71
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No deeper meaning behind it than that!</i></font>

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Tomorrow, when I see him, 
I'll properly apologize.</i></font>

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoi-chan, let's go buy some juice!</font>

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sleepy.</font>

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,270

90
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,880

98
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can it be?</font>

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't they always together?</font>

100
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way.</font>

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So? What did you want to see me for?</font>

102
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you might be feeling bothered 
about what I said yesterday.</font>

103
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

104
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, I'm not bothered at all.</font>

105
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,210

110
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,640

111

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, I figured we could go somewhere close.</font>

116
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,290

117
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,740

122
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,590

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm a bit nervous.</font>

137
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, really?</font>

138
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem like you're used to it, Senpai.</font>

139
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm? Yeah, I can't cook at all, so.</font>

140
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't even know how to boil rice.</font>

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, right.</i></font>

142
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Didn't he say he was 
living on his own before?</i></font>

143
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wonder if I'm allowed 
to ask him about that...</i></font>

144
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

145
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's Ichi!</font>

146
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh. The loud ones are here.</font>

147
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this? What's <i>this</i>?!</font>

148
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Getting dinner <i>together</i>?!</font>

149
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so jealous!</font>

150
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, and the yelling starts.</font>

151
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Harsh, man.</font>

152
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, can we join ya?</font>

153
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted a chance to really 
talk to the Prince for once.</font>

154
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No can do.</font>

155
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you leave us alone?</font>

156
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at him, treating us like 
we're a third wheel...</font>

157
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kuwa, could you take 
Sentaro away somewhere?</font>

158
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it.</font>

159
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha? Aw, c'mon!</font>

160
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've thought this before,</i></font>

161
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but this guy can just say things
like that at the drop of a hat.</i></font>

162
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm sure I'm the only one 
who keeps getting flustered.</i></font>

163
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah.</font>

164
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Prince!</font>

165
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry for eating your Choco anpan!</font>

166
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kuwa, you little...</font>

167
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Those guys are gonna pay for this later.</i></font>

168
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for waiting.</font>

169
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, it looks delicious!</font>

170
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, I'm starving.</font>

171
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Yoi-chan, chili oil?</font>

172
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-Thank you very... much.</font>

173
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're totally watching me.</i></font>

174
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Yoi-chan.</font>

175
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you scootch over?</font>

176
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop looking at her, dumbass.</font>

177
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, seriously?!</font>

178
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's really done it!</font>

179
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's so...</i></font>

180
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>close...</i></font>

181
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, it's a little 
tight, but bear with me.</font>

182
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How am I supposed to eat gyoza like—</i></font>

183
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it too cramped? You good?</font>

184
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine. I'm a little nervous, but...</font>

185
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, what was I about to say?</i></font>

186
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you know, I'm not used to 
being close to a man like this!</font>

187
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure this is nothing 
to you, Senpai, but...</font>

188
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ah, I just dug my own grave.</i></font>

189
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm nervous.</font>

190
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, I'm nervous.</font>

191
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you go again, 
saying stuff like that.</font>

192
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not going to be fooled.</font>

193
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh gosh...</i></font>

194
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My heart...</i></font>

195
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, over there.</font>

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's two boys sitting close together.</font>

197
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they flirting? So cute!</font>

198
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?!</font>

199
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's going to get cold if we don't eat it.</font>

200
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It burns...</i></font>

201
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The gyoza was good, yeah?</font>

202
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about we go to a different 
one next time?</font>

203
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sure...</font>

204
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's do that.</font>

205
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Man, I wasn't expecting 
to see those two there.</font>

206
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't remember what it tasted like.</i></font>

207
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That joint is popular, so I 
see familiar faces sometimes.</font>

208
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We gotta be extra careful next time.</font>

209
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Also, isn't Senpai acting normal?</i></font>

210
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even after what he did to me...</i></font>

211
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Am I just being overly self-conscious?</i></font>

212
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey...</font>

213
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been thinking, in my own way, 
about what you said yesterday.</font>

214
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

215
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I still don't know.</font>

216
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

217
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why did that hit me so hard again?</i></font>

218
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, can I try something out?</font>

219
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

220
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really gonna do it if we 
stay like this any longer.</font>

221
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait a min—</font>

222
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, wait, I can't.</font>

223
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was just eating gyoza.</font>

224
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does my breath stink?</font>

225
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You good?</font>

226
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm fine.</font>

227
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a close one.</font>

228
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Never mind that, though!</i></font>

229
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What was I about to...?</i></font>

230
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, hey, you want some gum?</font>

231
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They gave it to us at the restaurant.</font>

232
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

233
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What timing.</i></font>

234
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So.</font>

235
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Personally, I don't wanna destroy
the thing we've had going.</font>

236
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think?</font>

237
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would it be all right if I held your hand?</font>

238
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What are you talking about?!</font>

239
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We said at the start that we weren't 
going to do stuff like that!</font>

240
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it seemed like you were okay 
with the kiss just now.</font>

241
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I just froze in place because 
you caught me off guard!</font>

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, it's strange to offer your hand 
to see if you like someone or not!</font>

243
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It should be the other way around!</font>

244
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just...</font>

245
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never experienced a platonic 
relationship like this before.</font>

246
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need to try a bunch of tests 
to figure out how I feel.</font>

247
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>P-Platonic?!</i></font>

248
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

249
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't want to, I won't.</font>

250
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But people might mistake 
us for two guys again.</font>

251
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't care less about that.</font>

252
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We ended up holding hands anyway.</i></font>

253
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Senpai's hand is hot.</i></font>

254
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was unexpected...</i></font>

255
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is his the only hand that's hot?</i></font>

256
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yoi! Are you done in there?</font>

257
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I couldn't stand him at first.</i></font>

258
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But before I knew it,
I was fine with him.</i></font>

259
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's not a bad person, and it's not 
that I don't like him... maybe...</i></font>

260
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm not even sure of my own feelings.</i></font>

261
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I...</i></font>

262
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I find myself wanting Senpai 
to really fall in love with me.</i></font>

263
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not, "You're beautiful," or,
"I want you." Nothing like that.</i></font>

264
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If he just looked me in the 
eye and said it to me, then...</i></font>

265
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Such a self-serving and 
selfish way of thinking.</i></font>

266
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you're finally out!</font>

267
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sis...</font>

268
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

277

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Not "yet," huh.
That's what I thought.</font>

278

285

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We go to school together.
He's one year ahead of me.</font>

290
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,570
