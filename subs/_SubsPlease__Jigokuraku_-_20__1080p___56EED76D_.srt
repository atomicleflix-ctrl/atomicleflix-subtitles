<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is tao, the invisible attack.</i></font>

139
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here we go again, <i>Whatever</i>-emon.</font>

140
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Asaemon.</font>

141
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this rate, we cannot beat her.</font>

142
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To defeat the Tensen, we must destroy 
their tanden with hindering tao.</font>

143
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But unlike the others,</font>

144
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you and I still can't use ours properly.</font>

145
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
<font face="Times New Roman" size="20"><b>{\an1}<font color="#020000"><font size="40">Hell's Paradise</font></font></b></font>

146

<font face="Times New Roman" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font color="#03020f"><font size="25">Hell's Paradise</font></font></b></font>

147
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's finally time 
for the Heki... ji? Fukusho​?</font>

148
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Hekiji Fukusho ritual!</font>

149
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right? I got it!</font>

150
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This time, the offerings are</font>

151
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this really strong man 
and this really speedy little guy.</font>

152
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's right.</i></font>

153
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tao cannot be seen with the eyes.</font>

154
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since we'll be fighting 
battles involving tao,</font>

155
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we must first learn to sense it.</font>

156
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then...</font>

157
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Can you sense my tao?</font>

158
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

159
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because tao attacks are invisible, 
they're impossible to block.</font>

160
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That Tensen...</font>

161
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe her name is Tao Fa. 
Her attribute is wood.</font>

162
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My metal attribute hinders hers, 
so we should have the advantage.</font>

163
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But since I can't control mine, 
it won't be very effective.</font>

164
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to come up with a plan.</font>

165
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up!</font>

166
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't mention tao in my presence again.</font>

167
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too complicated to learn.</font>

168
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just starting to get fun. 
Don't spoil it.</font>

169
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fun?</font>

170
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tao is important, you know.</font>

171
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It lets you read your 
opponent's movements.</font>

172
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see. She's levels above the doshi.</i></font>

173
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It even goes wherever you want it to.</font>

174
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? Convenient, right?</font>

175
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you give up already?</font>

176
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't beat me without tao.</font>

177
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love it if you'd stop fighting 
and let us turn you into tan.</font>

178
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not done yet.</font>

179
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you having fun, too?</font>

180
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, you've been torturing humans 
for a thousand years.</font>

181
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing about this is fun.</font>

182
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We spend all our time 
training in immortality here.</font>

183
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We lure humans in for nourishment.</font>

184
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just that, over and over.</font>

185
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've done it for a thousand years,</font>

186
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I doubt we'd achieve 
perfect immortality</font>

187
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even if we did it for a thousand more.</font>

188
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mu Dan realized that. So has Ju Fa.</font>

189
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone has.</font>

190
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd lose my mind if I didn't laugh.</font>

191
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or maybe I'm laughing 
because I've lost my mind.</font>

192
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't fun for me at all.</font>

193
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea tao was this powerful.</font>

194
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you given up?</font>

195
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think an easy death would be 
better than a painful one.</font>

196
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is an incredible discovery.</font>

197
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A new phase in the study of life.</font>

198
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And most incredible of all, 
I can touch it.</font>

199
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like we've gained another organ.</font>

200
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

201
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must take this knowledge back home.</font>

202
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will change everything 
we know about medicine.</font>

203
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I'd been thorough in my studies,</font>

204
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there are still 
more fields to research.</font>

205
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't I tell you not to spoil the fun?</font>

206
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing's more fun 
than playing with a new toy.</font>

207
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like we're 
the ones being played with.</font>

208
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up!</font>

209
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really do seem 
like you're having fun.</font>

210
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucky.</font>

211
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be messed up in here.</font>

212
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So are you!</font>

213
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a dull comeback!</font>

214
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this... feeling?</font>

215
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He evaded the tao.</font>

216
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. I understand tao now.</font>

217
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't see it at all. 
Was that a fluke earlier?</font>

218
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nurugai's age probably factors in,</font>

219
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I think the reason you struggle 
to control your tao is because, well...</font>

220
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because you're thick-headed.</font>

221
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't believe in things 
you can't see, do you?</font>

222
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't control tao with your head.</font>

223
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must shut out reality 
and let your senses take over.</font>

224
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, try a little harder.</font>

225
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not interested.</font>

226
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not spending time 
on something I can't do.</font>

227
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only believe in things I can cut.</font>

228
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't be certain 
of anything I can't touch.</font>

229
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must be able to open, 
extract, and touch it.</font>

230
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you talking about?</font>

231
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like we're friends.</font>

232
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're all free to do what we want.</font>

233
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye-bye.</font>

234
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hup.</font>

235
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see, Little-emon. I can see that.</font>

236
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a stop-gap measure.</font>

237
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly, watch closely.</font>

238
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can learn to sense tao...</font>

239
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll have a shot at a counterattack!</font>

240
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't dodge at close range, can you?</font>

241
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to keep taking hits?</font>

242
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he can observe my tao?</font>

243
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so considerate 
of your friend. I love it.</font>

244
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are not friends.</font>

245
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are not friends, but I believe 
we are something similar.</font>

246
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a condemned criminal, aren't I? 
Are you sure that's okay?</font>

247
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're good at looking after others, 
like you did for Toma.</font>

248
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm aware of our standings,</font>

249
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and if you've committed a crime, 
I do not support that.</font>

250
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I've gotten to know you.</font>

251
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Condemned criminals are human, too.</font>

252
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Associating with them breeds sympathy.</font>

253
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In this brief but intense time, 
we've opened our hearts,</font>

254
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">extracted what's inside, and touched it.</font>

255
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I can touch it, it's simple.</font>

256
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samurai and criminals are the same.</font>

257
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Blood, flesh, bone...</font>

258
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the desire to live.</font>

259
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like a dissection.</font>

260
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your analogy was too disturbing. 
I didn't get it.</font>

261
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I won't say it again.</font>

262
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

263
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never say that what I really want is 
for all of us to make it back alive again.</font>

264
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're not friends, 
then you don't have to be sad.</font>

265
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't see anything, but...</i></font>

266
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can sense it. 
The little guy's in trouble.</i></font>

267
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must shut out reality 
and let your senses take over.</font>

268
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was able to sense her tao then...</i></font>

269
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>because my blood blurred
