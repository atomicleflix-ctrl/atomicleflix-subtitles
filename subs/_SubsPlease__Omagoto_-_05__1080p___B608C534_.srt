00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're back!</font>

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Stude?</font>

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ma'am?</font>

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss?</font>

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could it be...</font>

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up?</font>

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sara!</font>

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stude?!</font>

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milkit!</font>

12
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Flum's mind was consumed by an unquellable
rage toward the evil before her.</i></font>

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But it was not out of a sense of morality.</i></font>

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What, you came back?</font>

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was told you wouldn't!</font>

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, you!</font>

18
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,740
<font size="22"><b>{\an8}CAMARADERIE
CRUELTY</b></font>

19
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,030
<font size="22"><b>{\an8}CRUELTY AND CAMARADERIE</b></font>

20
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, miss!</font>

21
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stude and his mother are alive!</font>

22
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll be fine. I healed 'em with magic.</font>

23
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There're better ways to punish that guy!</font>

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss!</font>

25
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heh, gotcha.</font>

26
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I said the other day, Sara...</font>

27
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, you think you have time to chat?</font>

28
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One little flick from me, 
and you'll bleed to death.</font>

29
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some pieces of trash never learn 
their lesson and are better off dead.</font>

30
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the piece of trash, 
you stupid slave.</font>

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me hear you beg for your life.</font>

32
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh... Why ain't that killing you?</font>

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Don't. Please don't.</font>

34
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, miss!</font>

35
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, please! Don't do—</font>

36
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hearing <i>you</i> beg for your life felt good.</font>

37
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me, Sara.</font>

38
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I think I did the right thing, 
even if nobody else does.</font>

39
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Real bad guys don't learn 
even when they're punished.</font>

40
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The right... thing?</font>

41
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Disgusting.</i></font>

42
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad you're okay.</font>

43
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry I ruined the clothes 
you bought for me, Master.</font>

44
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to apologize for that.</font>

45
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I do.</font>

46
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the very first thing 
you gave me. It was important.</font>

47
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I apologize, Master.</font>

48
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even then, why worry about clothes now?</font>

49
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something much, 
much more important!</font>

50
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you... crying?</font>

51
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am, because I feel terrible.</font>

52
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mast—</font>

53
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why won't you scold me 
for not coming to save you sooner?</font>

54
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, snap at me!</font>

55
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She knew it was impossible, but she wanted
to hear something other than an apology.</i></font>

56
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A slave has no right to expect 
her master to come to her aid.</font>

57
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You <i>do</i> have the right!</font>

58
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want you to expect all that 
and more from me!</font>

59
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lean on me more!</font>

60
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do everything I can 
to grant all your desires!</font>

61
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For a moment, I did picture you 
coming to save me.</font>

62
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's... not acceptable.</font>

63
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine!</font>

64
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not slave and master!</font>

65
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're Milkit and Flum! 
That's how we ought to be!</font>

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to pamper you to death and 
make you the happiest girl in the world!</font>

67
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What did it mean for someone 
to shed tears for her?</i></font>

68
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What did it mean to want 
to make somebody happy?</i></font>

69
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It was all so new to Milkit that 
she struggled to find the answers.</i></font>

70
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What?</i></font>

71
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want a burial?</font>

72
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For those scoundrels?</font>

73
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm all for being compassionate, but 
I think prayer is wasted on the wicked.</font>

74
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss, I spent all night thinkin' 
about it, but I still don't get it.</font>

75
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not much of a thinker, see?</font>

76
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I dunno what makes one truly evil, 
or the right way to deal with 'em.</font>

77
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just don't get it at all.</font>

78
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think there's 
anything wrong with that.</font>

79
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you got hurt because of me!</font>

80
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Introspection is the privilege 
of the young!</font>

81
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pfft.</font>

82
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with that? 
We're only six years apart!</font>

83
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Six years is a long time at our age.</font>

84
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be a good girl and listen to me...</font>

85
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or else I'll tickle you good!</font>

86
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Wait!</font>

87
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That tickles!</font>

88
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Cyrill, get us back to the capital.</font>

89
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

90
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only you, with your Hero affinity, can use
magic to return us to our saved location.</font>

91
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get your act together, Cyrill.</font>

92
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Jean.</font>

93
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think an apology's going to cut it?</font>

94
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop.</font>

95
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it.</font>

96
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it all!</font>

97
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got rid of the distraction! 
So why is this happening?</font>

98
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cyrill, please.</font>

99
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Return.</font>

100
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We depart again in two days' time.</font>

101
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get your supplies in order by then.</font>

102
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once again, we failed 
to reach our destination.</font>

103
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No surprise, given how 
Jean and Cyrill were.</font>

104
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish Cyrill would act in a manner 
more befitting the hero.</font>

105
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have been tasked with the noble 
duty of exterminating the demons.</font>

106
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must see it to fruition at all costs.</font>

107
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something the matter?</font>

108
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I was just wondering 
if we could even pull it off.</font>

109
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have fewer members now.</font>

110
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There is no point thinking 
about those who left us.</font>

111
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No point, eh? The Church 
isn't going after them either.</font>

112
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of, I couldn't believe 
my eyes when I first saw Flum's stats.</font>

113
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Made me realize even a god 
can make mistakes.</font>

114
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't make mistakes.</font>

115
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not Lord Origin.</font>

116
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that wasn't a mistake,</font>

117
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it'd mean Flum had some necessary role 
to play in our party.</font>

118
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think it was?</font>

119
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't say. That's something 
Lord Origin only knows.</font>

120
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did your investigation of the lab 
yield anything, Neigass?</font>

121
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were right, Sheitoom.</font>

122
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was an old facility. 
I found papers from thirty years ago.</font>

123
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I also found a beast with one 
of those cores embedded in it.</font>

124
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are those guys trying to start 
something again?</font>

125
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not a power that can be controlled.</font>

126
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where in the world is it leaking from?</font>

127
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe the seal's weakening, Demon Lord.</font>

128
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not one thing has changed 
in my time as the medium.</font>

129
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I keep telling you 
to stop calling me that, Brother.</font>

130
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pah!</font>

131
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys put this Demon Chief label on me,</font>

132
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm just playing my part here.</font>

133
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, Tsyon, I get the feeling 
you like being called that.</font>

134
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were all, "Entertain us three 
Demon Chiefs" just the other day!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A small animal or rodent, maybe?</font>

270
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't it be noisier, then?</font>

271
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go take a look.</font>

272
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stay here, Master.</font>

273
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang on.</font>

274
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go.</font>

275
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wait here.</font>

276
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

277
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you wish.</font>

278
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll wait for you here, Master.</font>

279
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right!</font>

280
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't do.</font>

281
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Someone really is here.</i></font>

282
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh, this reeks.</font>

283
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It tastes awful, but no nutrients 
have been lost.</font>

284
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh? I know that voice.</i></font>

285
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm? Is somebody there?</font>

286
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eterna?</font>

287
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Flum.</font>

288
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you went back to your village.</font>

289
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, why?!</font>

290
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who did this to you?!</font>

291
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Who"?</font>

292
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jean, obviously.</font>

293
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what you deserve.</font>

294
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That vain, bratty, weak, virgin mage!</font>

295
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't know?</font>

296
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We would've all put a stop 
to it if we had!</font>

297
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm... I'm so glad.</font>

298
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad I got to hear that...</font>

299
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should never have 
believed what Jean said.</font>

300
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, Flum.</font>

301
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It brought Milkit into my life, 
so it wasn't all bad.</font>

302
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that her?</font>

303
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

304
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That face... Is it mustardo toxin?</font>

305
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trust Eterna to know.</font>

306
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can tell even with the bandages, huh?</font>

307
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's one of the most obvious 
toxins out there.</font>

308
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a favor to ask of you, Eterna.</font>

309
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please make an antidote.</font>

310
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:55,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I gave her the antidote ingredients 
I found during the kialahri search.</i></font>

311
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll take about three hours.</font>

312
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can trust Eterna.</font>

313
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll take a while for the toxin 
to clear up, but you'll get better.</font>

314
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

315
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if the toxin does go away,</font>

316
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll still be an filthy, ugly being.</font>

317
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your face isn't the only thing 
that's ugly about you.</font>

318
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's oozing out from within—
from every inch of you.</font>

319
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You filthy, ugly creature.</font>

320
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a filthy, ugly creature.</font>

321
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really think my feelings 
for you are that shallow?</font>

322
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're not.</font>

323
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what, 
I'll always be here for you.</font>
