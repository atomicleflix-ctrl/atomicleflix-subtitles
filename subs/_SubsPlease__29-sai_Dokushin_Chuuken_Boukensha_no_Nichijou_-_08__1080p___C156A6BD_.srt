40
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, y'know, I was wrestling with

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So <i>that's</i> why you're picking a fight with

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, I get it. Love's a

43
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,500

45
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,270

46
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dude, she shot you down!</font>

47
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,660

49
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm never gonna accept...</font>

50
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>you</i> as part of our village!</font>

51
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stupid Jan.</font>

52
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give it a rest.</font>

53
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's head back.</font>

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't stand a chance.</font>

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,420

56
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, did something happen 
between you and Jan?</font>

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just a bunch of smack talk
about him protecting the village.</font>

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. He is part of 
the village watch, after all.</font>

59
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he loves this place to boot.</font>

60
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hell of a smile to flash
after shooting the guy down.</i></font>

61
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, Hajime, what did he mean 
about you not being part of the village?</font>

62
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you live here?</font>

63
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I'd say I do my part.</font>

64
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the resident adventurer, y'know?</font>

65
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that jerkwad said 
he wasn't gonna accept you.</font>

66
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I haven't been here very long.</font>

67
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only since a little before I found you.</font>

68
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

70
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Natalie and the innkeep 
and Miss Olive are all so nice!</font>

71
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They are.</font>

72
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But their jobs involve interacting 
with outsiders on the regular,</font>

73
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so they were pretty accepting.</font>

74
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll still be a while before I'm truly 
recognized as part of the village.</font>

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then maybe don't go starting 
fights like you did earlier?</font>

76
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welp, how about some dinner, Rirui?!</font>

77
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He changed the subject.</font>

78
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Again with this? Damn.</i></font>

79
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're dealing with a magic beast 
boasting a quasi-calamity threat level.</font>

80
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A spikesaurus has been spotted
 on Mount Kunimi.</font>

81
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A spikesaurus?!</font>

82
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Kunimi is only two mountains over!</font>

83
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's something like that 
doing so close to the village?</font>

84
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It likely stumbled onto 
a resting wandering whale</font>

85
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and was carried here on its back.</font>

86
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spikesauruses are usually 
found in the Koxi region.</font>

87
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They are very aggressive magic beasts
 covered in hard spikes.</font>

88
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's likely fighting the creatures 
of Mount Kunimi for territory.</font>

89
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's probably also the cause of the 
earthquakes we've been experiencing.</font>

90
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who would we need to take on 
a magic beast of the quasi-calamity level?</font>

91
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This kind of threat would require an 
entire team of silver-rank adventurers.</font>

92
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Silver-rank?</font>

93
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And a whole team of them?</font>

94
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Little Hajime.</font>

95
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a pure silver rank, 
which is stronger than silver, yes?</font>

96
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How would you handle this thing?</font>

97
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never fought one before,</font>

98
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and if it usually takes 
a whole silver team...</font>

99
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds scary.</font>

100
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, come on! Talk about pathetic!</font>

101
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess that pure silver rank
 don't amount to much!</font>

102
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep your mouth shut when the 
adults are talking, boy!</font>

103
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Dad, I'm part of the village watch!</font>

104
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the dregs!</font>

105
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got a long way to go before 
you can start talking down to others!</font>

106
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get out!</font>

107
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. What the hell? 
I'm just as good as him!</font>

108
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon my stupid son. Please, continue.</font>

109
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, well, given how dangerous 
spikesauruses are,</font>

110
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it would be wise to assemble 
a team, as Olive suggested.</font>

111
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thankfully, there's a party of silver 
adventurers working out of central Rana</font>

112
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who've taken down a spikesaurus before.</font>

113
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How much will it cost?</font>

114
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seven villages will be pooling their 
funds, so it should be manageable.</font>

115
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

116
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One more thing...</font>

117
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Mr. Shinonome joins them,
we shouldn't have to pay as much!</font>

118
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it.</font>

119
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since I'm gonna be going after 
a spikesaurus soon,</i></font>

120
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>today's a good day to take
 it easy with some slimes.</i></font>

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much.</font>

122
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, excuse me!</font>

123
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the resident adventurer, right?</font>

124
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Jan, my son. Have you seen him?</font>

125
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jan, Donato, and Alisa...</font>

126
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All three of them are missing.</font>

127
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I spoke with an adventurer who saw
 them on the path to Mount Kunimi!</font>

128
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those little idiots!</font>

129
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll drag 'em back
and teach 'em a lesson!</font>

130
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hang on.</font>

131
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's dangerous to go now.</font>

132
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me go, damn it!</font>

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go after them.</font>

134
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get me all the material you've
