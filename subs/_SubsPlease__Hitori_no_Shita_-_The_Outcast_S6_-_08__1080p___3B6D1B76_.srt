00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Episode 8</font>

2
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A place where you can truly 
stand tall and upright!</font>

3
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bastard, what are you doing? 
Why did you come back here?</font>

4
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I figured out the 
meaning of sincerity!</font>

5
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

6
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This</i> would be
"standing tall and upright!"</font>

7
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, neither riddle is 
hard to solve on its own.</font>

8
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The difficulty is how
 to put them together.</font>

9
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The character "sincerity" 
must be above "who is human."</font>

10
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's extremely hard to process the 
power gained from crossing the valley.</font>

11
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After crossing it, the extraordinary 
power profoundly changes one's mindset,</font>

12
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">making it hard to focus 
on the sincerity clue.</font>

13
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a common flaw for 
most people who do things.</font>

14
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Theoretically, we should aim for 100%,</font>

15
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we get distracted by external factors,</font>

16
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">such as unfavorable circumstances 
or insufficient capability,</font>

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">ultimately settling for an outcome of 80%.</font>

18
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even so, we might even be 
happy with a score of 60%.</font>

19
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the master here doesn't
see it that way.</font>

20
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least when it comes to 
what it means to be human,</font>

21
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he only accepts 100%.</font>

22
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never mind. It's my fault.</font>

23
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er, I forgot about your 
intermittent moments of clarity.</font>

24
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The answer to sincerity 
is remarkably simple.</font>

25
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sincerity is trustworthiness.</font>

26
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sincerity is the Way of Heaven.</font>

27
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Way of Heaven does not 
negotiate with people.</font>

28
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Way of Heaven leaves 
no room for compromise.</font>

29
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sincerity is one of the Way 
of Heaven's characteristics.</font>

30
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Outcasts who understand what it means
to stand between heaven and earth</font>

31
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">shouldn't be confused 
by that valley outside.</font>

32
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must pursue it 100%!</font>

33
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Find the place where one truly stands 
tall between heaven and earth!</font>

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get it! Standing tall between heaven
and earth refers to my Baihui acupoint!</font>

35
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xia, why must we necessarily 
focus on the "heaven" part?</font>

36
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to reach the sky, you 
must be standing on the ground.</font>

37
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny, you've never tried 
this spot before, have you?</font>

38
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh... so that's how it is.</font>

39
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, this is it: 
standing tall between heaven and earth.</font>

40
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The acupoint reaching towards heaven 
is the Baihui point on top of the head.</font>

41
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So "standing on the ground"</font>

42
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">would naturally be this one.</font>

43
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It follows the Kidney Meridian of 
Foot-Shaoyin, facing downwards.</font>

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's also known as the bottomless 
cave, the Yongquan acupoint!</font>

45
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So a place like this actually exists.</font>

46
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No doubt about it,</font>

47
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this is the answer to "standing 
tall between heaven and earth."</font>

48
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny, we found it...</font>

49
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? It's just another empty room.</font>

50
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look over there, you guys.</font>

51
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Nine-Bend Winding Cave...</font>

52
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the Sect Leader's!</font>

53
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I recognize the Sect Leader's handwriting!</font>

54
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Come check this out!</font>

55
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something was carved on this wall here.</font>

56
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was erased later.</font>

57
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's more here too!</font>

58
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's some here too... They're words!</font>

59
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you look closely, a lot of this 
cave's surface has been polished.</font>

60
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Over here!</font>

61
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are complete words here!</font>

62
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"This method is true and wonderful,</font>

63
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because I am unique and 
different from others.</font>

64
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that the reversal 
arises from Li and Kan,</font>

65
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But who recognizes that floating and 
sinking determine host and guest?</font>

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The golden cauldron wishes to 
retain the cinnabar within.</font>

67
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Within the jade pool, first deposit 
the silver into the water."</font>

68
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Divine Jade Capital?</font>

69
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Wasn't this by...</font>

70
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Boduan...
also known as Master Ziyang!</font>

71
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Boduan?</font>

72
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's Master Ziyang?</font>

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jinfeng! You innate types, honestly!</font>

74
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Boduan, known as Master 
Wuzhen or Master Ziyang,</font>

75
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is the founder of
the Southern School of Alchemy.</font>

76
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no surprise that an innate 
prodigy like you wouldn't know him.</font>

77
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But for those who
cultivated later in life,</font>

78
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">not knowing him is like a carpenter 
not knowing Lu Ban, right, Zhang?</font>

79
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Boduo? Of course I know him!</font>

80
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Zhang!</font>

81
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This guy doesn't have a clue.</font>

82
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the master of this place is 
the legendary Master Ziyang,</font>

83
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then it's not unthinkable for one 
person to have created all of this...</font>

84
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. So that's the answer the Sect
Leader always wanted me to find on my own.</font>

85
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The master of this place is 
such an extraordinary outcast.</font>

86
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes and no.</font>

87
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Boduo is indeed the answer,</font>

88
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but there's more behind the answer 
that the Sect Leader wanted to convey.</font>

89
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

90
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think Wu Gensheng modified
the patterns on the valley walls outside?</font>

91
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

92
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can never understand why 
he does what he does...</font>

93
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xia, how much space do you think it would 
take to engrave the entire Wuzhen Chapter?</font>

94
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm...</font>

95
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This wall should be enough.</font>

96
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But look, this entire stone cave 
is covered in erased engravings.</font>

97
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Combined with that Nine-Bend Winding Cave,</font>

98
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wu Gensheng is clearly 
refuting Master Ziyang.</font>

99
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As expected of the Sect Leader!</font>

100
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He doesn't even show respect to 
the legendary founder of alchemy!</font>

101
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What exactly is the Sect Leader 
refuting about Master Ziyang?</font>

102
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This very Nine-Bend Winding Cave 
also originates from a story.</font>

103
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A master and his three disciples</font>

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">passed through a place called Yuhua 
on their cultivation journey.</font>

105
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The city lord of Yuhua showed 
them great reverence and respect,</font>

106
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so the three disciples passed their divine
abilities to the city lord's three sons.</font>

107
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This alerted a den of lion 
spirits living nearby.</font>

108
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ancestor of these lion spirits resided
within the Nine-Bend Winding Cave,</font>

109
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">known as the Nine-Spirit Primordial Sage.</font>

110
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nine-Spirit Primordial Sage?</font>

111
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you're saying this
is where spirits live?</font>

112
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, the key lies in the name 
"Nine-Spirit Primordial Sage."</font>

113
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Nine-Spirit" refers to the Nine Heavens,</font>

114
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and can also be
interpreted as the Nine Suns.</font>

115
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This Primordial Sage is also interesting.</font>

116
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">While many have been honored as sages,</font>

117
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">only one has been
revered as the Great Sage.</font>

118
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the one whom this Great 
Sage so vehemently revered…</font>

119
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was the Primordial Sage.</font>

120
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only the Primordial Sage is worthy of 
being called the "master of masters."</font>

121
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The story also reveals that 
the Heavenly King Guangmu</font>

122
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">tells the Monkey King the 
root of the calamity.</font>

123
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is because you wanted to 
become a master to others</font>

124
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you stirred up this den of lions.</font>

125
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This convoluted tale serves as 
a warning to future cultivators:</font>

126
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">do not recklessly become a master!</font>

127
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This place was probably intended 
to screen for such individuals.</font>

128
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They must have enough luck or be fated to 
understand this place and its riddles.</font>

129
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Furthermore, this person must 
have enough sincerity.</font>

130
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only those who ultimately 
qualify can reach this place</font>

131
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and receive the message 
engraved into the stone cave.</font>

132
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, so are you saying that after the 
Sect Leader solved the riddles here,</font>

133
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he thought Ziyang's method of conveying 
information was too careless,</font>

134
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so he erased the engravings in the cave?</font>

135
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. Do you guys think 
this valley is miraculous?</font>

136
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miraculous... Just going through it 
once allows you to open your meridians.</font>

137
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is as incredible as Spirit 
Manipulation or Divine Craftsmanship.</font>

138
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Wu Gensheng only 
modified what was outside.</font>

139
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He completely erased what 
was inside the cave.</font>

140
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bye, Xia!</font>

141
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to you, I've seen 
some interesting things.</font>

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If anything like this
happens again, call me!</font>

143
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will, I will!</font>

144
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph, what a weirdo.</font>

145
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, you guys really 
helped out a lot this time.</font>

146
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thank you on behalf of Jinfeng.</font>

147
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's part ways here.</font>

148
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granny!</font>

149
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll definitely visit you again.</font>

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't give up looking for 
whoever took the collection.</font>

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't give up looking for 
clues about Qi Genesis.</font>

152
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That collection might not have 
any clues about Qi Genesis.</font>

153
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. Even if it doesn't,</font>

154
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll still deal with whoever took it.</font>

155
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you helping me?</font>

156
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're from the Express Delivery Company,</font>

157
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I'm from the Quan Xing Sect.</font>

158
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're both family members
of the 36 Thieves!</font>

159
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">F-Family?</font>

160
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What family?</font>

161
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jinfeng is no family of the Sect Leader!</font>

162
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whether they brought suffering or joy,</font>

163
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without the 36 Thieves, none of 
what we've experienced would exist.</font>

164
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should inherit their legacy</font>

165
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and unravel their mysteries.</font>

166
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If what they left is harmful,</font>

167
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then we should eradicate it.</font>

168
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's all. I'll contact Xia 
through Qiu later to find you.</font>

169
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on.</font>

170
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's my number.</font>

171
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Keep calling if you can't get through.</font>

172
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not used to carrying a phone...</font>

173
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just don't trust
that bastard Zhang Chulan!</font>

174
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't listen to his bullshit!</font>

175
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jinfeng! How are you the 
Sect Leader's family?</font>

176
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then... what about me?</font>

177
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do... Do I count as a 
member of your family too?</font>

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cut the crap!</font>

179
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're coming back
to the cave with me later.</font>

180
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? We just got out and we're going back?</font>

181
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any connections...</font>

182
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for obtaining explosives?</font>

183
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Explosives?</font>

184
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh... I know a few guys
 who could get some.</font>

185
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to go back because I finally
understood the Sect Leader's intentions.</font>

186
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er, how's your injury?</font>

187
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you all right?</font>

188
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

189
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're fine? How did you get hurt?</font>

190
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got shot.</font>

191
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like you said, just a scratch.</font>

192
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't affect my movement.</font>

193
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's another thing.</font>

194
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you really get into a fight with 
Wang Zhenqiu again, keep an eye out.</font>

195
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After I give you this signal, 
find a chance to get hurt.</font>

196
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just a scratch, nothing 
that affects your movement.</font>

197
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This bastard has definitely 
got me on his radar.</font>

198
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll be a major pain in the neck 
inside the Company from now on.</font>

199
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's better to keep a close eye on him,</font>

200
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but why am I feeling conflicted 
about this outcome?</font>

201
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe deep down, I didn't want 
Wang Zhenqiu to make that choice?</font>

202
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up? Did you have 
that much fun this time?</font>

203
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you look like you want more?</font>

204
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want more?</font>

205
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, how should I put it?</font>

206
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These two are both top-tier,</font>

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">totally different from 
anyone I've met before.</font>

208
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er is amazing!</font>

209
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she's too naïve.</font>

210
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan is the interesting one.</font>

211
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I saw several sides to him,</font>

212
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">each with a completely different vibe,</font>

213
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they all seemed real.</font>

214
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are just too many 
contradictions in this person.</font>

215
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, that curly-haired 
guy Feng Baobao dragged in,</font>

216
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">why did you just let him go?</font>

217
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, him...</font>

218
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello? Can you hear me?</font>

219
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello? Hello?</font>

220
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm losing control! What's happening?</font>

221
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As he didn't stop cultivation,</font>

222
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the result would've been the same</font>

223
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">whether I let him go or not.</font>

224
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so boring.</font>

225
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See, people are just so 
complex and contradictory.</font>

226
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't fob me off with that.</font>

227
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan is the most interesting one.</font>

228
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's incredibly goal-oriented.</font>

229
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There must be a clear guiding principle</font>

230
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">behind all those contradictions in him.</font>

231
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love to dissect that guy.</font>

232
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that guy was really just a jerk,</font>

233
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd be much more relaxed.</font>

234
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of backbone is wrapped 
up inside this guy's rotten flesh?</font>

235
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you use the Golden Light 
Incantation or Thunder Magic?</font>

236
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used both.</font>

237
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it that bad?</font>

238
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You won't die, but it's hard to treat.</font>

239
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't compare to you.</font>

240
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got shot and were fine by morning.</font>

241
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not by morning...</font>

242
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was fine straightaway.</font>

243
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way,
what happened after I rushed in?</font>

244
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No idea.</font>

245
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No idea?</font>

246
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That woman rushed over and hugged me,</font>

247
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then extended a hand.</font>

248
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hand?</font>

249
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, a blue hand.</font>

250
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My head hurt so much...</font>

251
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The last time I remember it 
hurting that much was years ago.</font>

252
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the time the pain 
subsided and I could focus,</font>

253
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she was already dead.</font>

254
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brother San!</font>

255
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan!</font>

256
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

257
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's Baobao? Where are you two?</font>

258
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be back soon.</font>

259
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I need you and Brother Si to 
help with something first.</font>

260
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I'll tell you about Lyu Chi and 
the Lyu clan's actions when we get back.</font>

261
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. Hurry over. We also 
have some stuff to tell you.</font>

262
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? I'm being targeted again?</font>

263
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is it?</font>

264
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lu Linglong? Lu Lin?</font>

265
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er, there's some stuff 
I need your advice on.</font>

266
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello? Chulan, how are you?</font>

267
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you thought about
what I asked you to do</font>

268
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when you were last at the Company?</font>

269
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to talk? Sure.</font>

270
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm, I see...</font>

271
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wang Zhenqiu has already reported 
the details of this incident.</font>

272
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've already told people 
to find Liu Mingyuan.</font>

273
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for those foreigners,</font>

274
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they were probably hired.</font>

275
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang, you can speak freely here.</font>

276
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me what's on your mind.</font>

277
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What can I say about this...</font>

278
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do San and Si think?</font>

279
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't told them yet.</font>

280
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not yet?</font>

281
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You suspect them too?</font>

282
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From your perspective,</font>

283
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's understandable.</font>

284
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So does that mean you trust me?</font>

285
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm talking nonsense.</font>

286
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that you trust me,</font>

287
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you just have no other choice.</font>

288
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With Feng Baobao's situation,</font>

289
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if I were the enemy, you'd 
be completely helpless.</font>

290
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wise.</font>

291
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, we can proceed with this,</font>

292
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I don't have much hope.</font>

293
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if you want to get involved,</font>

294
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you must discuss it with San and Si.</font>

295
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I watched those two grow up.</font>

296
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know exactly who they are</font>

297
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and what they're capable of.</font>

298
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Chulan, do you feel 
you need to have everything</font>

299
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">firmly in your grasp before 
you can feel at ease?</font>

300
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not really.</font>

301
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't have to shoulder 
Baobao's burden alone.</font>

302
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't handle it.</font>

303
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must weigh the risks and rewards of 
choosing a trustworthy person yourself.</font>

304
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that.</font>

305
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this isn't my fault!</font>

306
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think about someone like Erzhuang!</font>

307
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ultimately, it's because there are too 
many weirdos in the world of Outcasts...</font>

308
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, let's go with your plan as it is.</font>

309
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, what about that favor 
I asked you last time?</font>

310
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, about that.</font>

311
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me where he is.</font>

312
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll head out immediately.</font>

313
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I have two conditions.</font>

314
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One: I need an assistant.</font>

315
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I succeed, he'll be the one.</font>

316
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two: with a subordinate, I'd be a leader.</font>

317
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about a raise?</font>

318
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One is fine,</font>

319
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but for two,
go discuss it with San and Si!</font>

320
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be like that, Chairman Zhao!</font>

321
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those two are cheapskates!</font>

322
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on! Master, read my fortune!</font>

323
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Fortune-telling</font>

324
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

325
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's his deal? He didn't 
say anything for ages!</font>

326
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why he's cute!</font>

327
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that's not fortune-telling!</font>

328
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look like you're about to eat him!</font>

329
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master...</font>

330
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been having bad luck lately.</font>

331
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you read my fortune?</font>

332
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er!</font>

333
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get him! Don't let him escape!</font>

334
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me go, Zhang Chulan!</font>

335
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get this Bao girl to let me go!</font>

336
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, still so arrogant?</font>

337
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Lingyu, you disgraced 
disciple of the Tenshifu!</font>

338
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only been a while since we 
parted ways at Longhu Mountain,</font>

339
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you've caused so much trouble</font>

340
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that you got kicked out of the sect.</font>

341
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zhang Lingyu,</font>

342
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">our master went down the mountain</font>

343
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and single-handedly wiped out all 
those members of the Quan Xing Sect.</font>

344
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you also went down the mountain,</font>

345
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you allied with the Bone-Scraping 
Blade and the Seed of Calamity,</font>

346
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and fought those who were assisting our
master in eliminating the Quan Xing Sect.</font>

347
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you come to lecture me, Zhang Chulan?</font>

348
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lecture you?</font>

349
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be honest, I've never truly 
known a woman in my life,</font>

350
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">let alone loved one.</font>

351
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's no way I can 
understand your feelings,</font>

352
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">nor do I have the right to lecture you.</font>

353
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I admire your willingness to 
sacrifice yourself for others.</font>

354
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you say yesterday that he's 
just an idiot with no future?</font>

355
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Bao is right.</font>

356
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no future.</font>

357
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are your plans?</font>

358
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you come with me 
and work at the Company?</font>

359
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need your pity.</font>

360
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

361
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember how you used to brag to me?</font>

362
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pity you? I'd be happy to see you fail!</font>

363
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not pitiful, you're useful.</font>

364
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just that no one will hire you now.</font>

365
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Longhu Mountain has
 already kicked you out.</font>

366
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you hadn't cause that scene,</font>

367
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as a disciple of the Tenshifu,</font>

368
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">those so-called righteous 
guys won't take you either.</font>

369
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But don't forget, you have the 
Heaven Communicating Talisman!</font>

370
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eventually, someone will 
come looking for you.</font>

371
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fortune-telling...</font>

372
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Couldn't you have written more?</font>

373
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Made it sound more mysterious?</font>

374
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't even pull off being a conman 
after leaving Longhu Mountain.</font>

375
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't look well.</font>

376
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

377
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got beaten up,</font>

378
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for cleaning up your mess!</font>

379
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that I blame you.</font>

380
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get me wrong, 
I'm not being nice to you.</font>

381
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master Zhang, I'm begging you to help me.</font>

382
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're... begging me?</font>

383
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Quan Xing Sect,
 Longhu Mountain, the World Association,</font>

384
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wang clan, Lyu clan, Lu clan...</font>

385
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">ever since I stepped into this 
world, everyone's been watching me.</font>

386
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't hold on alone much longer.</font>

387
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master, I'm so tired.</font>

388
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want a friend I 
can trust to support me.</font>

389
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know you've never liked me</font>

390
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we're completely different people.</font>

391
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, Master, just think it over.</font>

392
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me an answer whether

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bao'er, let's go.</font>

394
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

395
