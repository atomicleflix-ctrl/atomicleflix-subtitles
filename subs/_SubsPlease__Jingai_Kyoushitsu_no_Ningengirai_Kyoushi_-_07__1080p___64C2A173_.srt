00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">HAPPY GRADUATION!
Kyoka, congrats on graduating!</font>

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Congrats!</font>

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much, everyone.</font>

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When do you get to turn human?</font>

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In two days' time.</font>

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With the scholarship I received
from the director,</font>

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be moving next to the dance school.</font>

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyoka, is that...</font>

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a commemorative gift
for graduating students.</font>

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even after I become human
and lose my memories of this place,</font>

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wearing this ring will let me remember
it all and enter the school barrier.</font>

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma.</font>

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for everything
over the past year.</font>

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've worked hard, Minazuki.</font>

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you told me about your
shortcomings, it was a revelation.</font>

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had longed to be perfect,
but being imperfect is fine.</font>

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And helping each other to overcome those
imperfections is what makes one human.</font>

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's right.</font>

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma.</font>

21
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for teaching me
what it is to be human.</font>

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Minazuki.</font>

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for letting me be your teacher.</font>

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}EPISODE 7: THE MISANTHROPE AND THE FRUITLESS LOVE FORTUNE
That marks the end of another school year!</font>

25
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}EPISODE 7: THE MISANTHROPE AND THE FRUITLESS LOVE FORTUNE
Cheers, everyone!</font>

26
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

27
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you're too kind.</font>

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't had drinks
with co-workers in so long.</font>

29
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma.</font>

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your cup's looking empty.</font>

31
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, thank you.</font>

32
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have some, too, Ms. Saotome.</font>

33
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I prefer this.</font>

34
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sake?</font>

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Yuki, control yourself.</font>

36
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many bottles have you had?</font>

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

38
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure do drink like a fish.</font>

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't you promise to hold back
when we're in public?</font>

40
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We only get to celebrate
like this once a year!</font>

41
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop making excuses.</font>

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just look at the shock
on Mr. Hitoma's face.</font>

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?
You've got the wrong idea!</font>

44
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I used to be a yuki-onna
who lived in a cold region,</font>

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">which is why I can hold my liquor!</font>

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You used to be a yuki-onna?!</font>

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I never mention it?</font>

48
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you aware of this, Mr. Hoshino?</font>

49
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yes.</font>

50
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hoshino, were you a non-human as well?</font>

51
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I've always been human.</font>

52
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That reminds me, I was drinking
when we first met, Mr. Hoshino.</font>

53
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I got stranded up
on a snowy mountain.</font>

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw a woman in a kimono holding a
sake bottle and thought I was a goner.</font>

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How mean!</font>

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That brings back memories, though.</font>

57
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The moment I fell in love at first sight.</font>

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

59
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't expect you to follow me all
the way to America after that.</font>

60
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Hey, um...</font>

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would the two of you happen to be...</font>

62
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're married.</font>

63
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Husband and wife?!</font>

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that handkerchief I stained was a gift</i>
<i>from Ms. Saotome to Mr. Hoshino?</i></font>

65
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, it all makes sense now...</i></font>

66
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Finally, my own place
in the staff dormitory!</font>

67
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An apartment with an eight-tatami bedroom
and twelve-tatami living-dining space!</font>

68
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And all for the stellar rent of 20,000
yen per month, utilities included!</font>

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A corner room on the top floor.</font>

70
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And no one's moved in below or next door,
so I can be loud as I want!</font>

71
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a paradise for a gamer like me!</font>

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here to visit.</font>

73
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd you know I moved in?</font>

74
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma, thanks for your
hard work over the past year.</font>

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you here?</font>

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bet it was pretty different
from your last school.</font>

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you think?</font>

78
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of question is that?
Are you supposed to be my co-worker?</font>

79
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, how was it?</font>

80
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think you'll still stay on?</font>

81
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me think.</font>

82
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lot happened,
but I had a decent time.</font>

83
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Good to hear it.</font>

84
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, and the principal wants to see you.</font>

85
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! Tell me that <i>first</i>!</font>

86
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's someone I'd like you to meet.</font>

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">None other than the director
of Shiranui High School.</font>

88
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The director?</font>

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's waiting in the director's office.</font>

90
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come with me, and I'll introduce you.</font>

91
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Understood.</font>

92
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon us.</font>

93
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're here.</font>

94
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Haneda?</font>

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hitoma.</font>

96
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was happy to hear your time
at this school has been decent.</font>

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me formally introduce you.</font>

98
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is our director, Lady Shiranui.</font>

99
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She happens to be a phoenix.</font>

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The most powerful being,
who reigns over all of existence.</font>

101
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A phoenix?</font>

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I am a crow tengu.</font>

103
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

104
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can see a month into the future,
albeit in fragments.</font>

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thus, I knew you would
do well at this school,</font>

106
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">which is why I decided to hire you.</font>

107
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See into the future?</font>

108
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to take you by surprise.</font>

109
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tobari Haneda is a form I take
to observe the students more intimately.</font>

110
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, D-Director?</font>

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How should I be treating
you going forward?</font>

112
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way you always have, if you would.</font>

113
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a precaution, let me warn you
that I'll fire you if you reveal who I am.</font>

114
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The same goes for whoever finds out.</font>

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I ask who else knows about this?</font>

116
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just me and Haruka, the school nurse.</font>

117
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That reminds me.</font>

118
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Last fall, you were worried
when I had fallen ill.</font>

119
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for your concern back then.</font>

120
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'd forgotten all about that.</font>

121
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always exhaust myself every year
preparing for the new students.</font>

122
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's what it was.</font>

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I first established this school,
it was nothing more than on a whim.</font>

124
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But over time, I began to enjoy it.</font>

125
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love seeing mortal
beings try their best.</font>

126
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I decided to enroll
as a student to become human.</font>

127
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My goal is to turn human so
I can draw my last breath.</font>

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Watching them made me want to live
for the sake of facing death.</font>

129
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

130
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Mr. Hitoma. Do you like humans?</font>

131
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans are selfish and
don't care about others.</font>

132
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good people are taken advantage
of, and honesty gets you nowhere.</font>

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate humans.</font>

134
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may hate humans, but I think
I'm fine with that for now.</font>

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

136
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's to a new school year.</font>

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}ADVANCED CLASS
<i>Okay, first day of the new term.</i></font>

138
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Last year, it was a Soran Bushi dance...</i></font>

139
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you!</font>

140
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei! Please marry me!</font>

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

142
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph!</font>

143
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the big idea, Sui?</font>

144
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karin, stop destroying
the moral fiber of our classroom!</font>

145
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Hitoma, you're a teacher,
so stop blushing!</font>

146
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in the middle of talking
to the teacher.</font>

147
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you please pipe down, Sui?</font>

148
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

149
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a riot.</font>

150
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Hitoma, aren't you going to
respond to Karin's proposal?</font>

151
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Um...</font>

152
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want two kids!</font>

153
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd <i>that</i> come from?!</font>

154
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, well...</font>

155
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but I can't marry you.</font>

156
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?!</font>

157
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What kind of...</font>

158
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, first off.</font>

159
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just messing with me, aren't you?</font>

160
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all!</font>

161
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really love you, Mr. Rei!</font>

162
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

163
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei, please believe me.</font>

164
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, I won't be led astray.</i></font>

165
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I know! I'll recite all</i>
<i>of the Japanese eras.</i></font>

166
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Taika, Hakuchi, Shucho, Taiho, Keiun, Wado</i></font>

167
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei? Mr. Rei!</font>

168
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>– Tenpyo-shoho, Tenpyo-hoji...</i>
– He's frozen up.</font>

169
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Let's move on to our first
homeroom of the new school year.</font>

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, let's introduce ourselves...</font>

171
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kurosawa, wake up.</font>

172
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who're you?</font>

173
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The advanced class homeroom
teacher, Rei Hitoma.</font>

174
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see...</font>

175
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wake up!</font>

176
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, are you feeling unwell?</font>

177
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm fine.</font>

178
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's good...</font>

179
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, hang in there
just a little longer.</font>

180
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be done after a short talk.</font>

181
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's continue our introductions.</font>

182
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Rei Hitoma.
I teach social studies.</font>

183
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my second year being
in charge of the advanced class.</font>

184
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope we can have a great year together.</font>

185
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

186
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now for...</font>

187
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me introduce myself first!</font>

188
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Karin Ryuzaki, and I just moved up
to the advanced class.</font>

189
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I belong to the noble dragon family.</font>

190
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to become human to find love.</font>

191
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Mr. Rei, will you teach me about love?</font>

192
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not happening.</font>

193
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grr...</font>

194
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't set off
the right event flag yet?</font>

195
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will not give up!</font>

196
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll <i>ensure</i> that you fall in love
and agree to marry me!</font>

197
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just you wait!</font>

198
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, you're up next, Nezu.</font>

199
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it!</font>

200
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Machi! Machi Nezu!
I'm a mouse!</font>

201
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to become human so
I can eat lots of tasty food!</font>

202
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a simple-minded reason.</font>

203
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something tasty I ate lately is
our dorm mom Ryouko's homemade pudding!</font>

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The trend nowadays is silky-soft pudding,</font>

205
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but Ryouko's is on the firmer side
with a rich, milky flavor,</font>

206
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">not to mention how you
can really taste the eggs!</font>

207
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds more like a food review
than an introduction.</font>

208
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next, Kurosawa.</font>

209
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neneko Kurosawa. Cat.</font>

210
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My reason for wanting
to become human... is a secret.</font>

211
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neneko wouldn't tell the intermediate
class last year why she wants to be human.</font>

212
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never knew that.</font>

213
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neneko's always been like that.</font>

214
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Putting on an act
because she thinks it's cool—</font>

215
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What is it?</font>

216
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want?</font>

217
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Say something!</font>

218
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I—</font>

219
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So scary!</font>

220
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help me, Mr. Hitoma!</font>

221
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's so scary!</font>

222
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't say anything yet.</font>

223
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were flashing your fangs at me!</font>

224
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You definitely want to gobble me up!</font>

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're paranoid.</font>

226
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I bet you taste bad, Machi.</font>

227
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That ticks me off in its own way!</font>

228
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

229
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning!</font>

230
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei! I love you!</font>

231
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're supposed to greet
people with "good morning."</font>

232
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, wanna marry me?</font>

233
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really.</font>

234
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Boo...</font>

235
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this!</font>

236
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Th-Th-This feeling on my back...</i></font>

237
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up, Mr. Hitoma? You look so funny!</font>

238
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ohgami. Help me.</font>

239
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get it. You're killing me here!</font>

240
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karin-rin, are you down bad
for Mr. Hitoma?</font>

241
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like, <i>serious</i> serious?</font>

242
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or do you just think it's funny to toy
with him like Isaki?</font>

243
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm downright serious.</font>

244
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Omigosh, that's adorbs!</font>

245
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karin-rin's, like, <i>so</i> cute!</font>

246
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Loving it. You go, girl!</font>

247
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the first time I've seen you
like this, but you're pretty funny.</font>

248
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For real? Thanks!</font>

249
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hope you vibe with both Isaki and Isaki!</font>

250
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you get off me already?</font>

251
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you all tomorrow.</font>

252
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey Karin-rin, tell me more about
that natural makeup from before!</font>

253
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean the cosmetics from ancient times?
Sure thing.</font>

254
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I need to talk to you, Ryuzaki.</font>

255
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you spare a moment right now?</font>

256
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!
You want to confess your love, Mr. Rei?!</font>

257
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know that's not it.</font>

258
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karin-rin, I'll be waiting for you.</font>

259
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure!</font>

260
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">– Ryuzaki.
– Y-Yes?</font>

261
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About this morning.</font>

262
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You shouldn't be so clingy with me,
so let's not do that.</font>

263
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I don't know how serious you are,
but I can't go along with it,</font>

264
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'd like you to stop
with the sudden declarations of love.</font>

265
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see why, right? So please.</font>

266
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna.</font>

267
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna, I don't wanna!
I don't wanna, I don't wanna!</font>

268
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't stop telling you
that I love you, Mr. Rei!</font>

269
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? But why?</font>

270
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since I'm in love with you, of course!</font>

271
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why me, of all people?</font>

272
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well...</font>

273
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei, remember when you
snuck off campus with Sui?</font>

274
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

275
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was tailing Sui that day.</font>

276
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's when I saw you, Mr. Rei.</font>

277
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back then, you were absolutely stunning.</font>

278
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:24,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite looking hesitant,
you chose to leave school with Sui, right?</font>

279
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to become human to find love.</font>

280
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to find love
to be cherished by someone.</font>

281
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seeing you take action for your student,
all while hesitating,</font>

282
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't help but fall in love.</font>

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it lame to be so hesitant?</font>

284
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your reservations show
that you gave it some thought.</font>

285
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't think of anything cooler.</font>

286
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really laying it on there, huh?</font>

287
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei, you're a wonderful
human who cherishes others.</font>

288
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Long ago...</font>

289
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew a human just like that.</font>

290
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was an era when I could
still live close to humans.</font>

291
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I inhabited a cave in the mountains,</font>

292
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">spending my days warding off the humans
and animals that'd wander in.</font>

293
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may have been alone,
but I led a comfortable life.</font>

294
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until one day, an injured human
princess appeared before me.</font>

295
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The princess cherished me so.</font>

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I learned from her
how nice it feels to be petted.</font>

297
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To this day, I still remember
our final day together.</font>

298
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A prince from a neighboring
kingdom showed up.</font>

299
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was under the impression that I had
kidnapped the princess to hold captive.</font>

300
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And so he brought a large
number of soldiers to my cave.</font>

301
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Since they took up swords against me,
I had no choice but to fight,</font>

302
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but human attacks
were completely ineffective on me.</font>

303
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was about
to wipe out the prince's army,</font>

304
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the princess began to plead with me.</font>

305
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Please don't hurt the poor
prince any longer," she said.</font>

306
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The princess left with the prince
to return to human society...</font>

307
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Paying no mind to what would become of me.</font>

308
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was then that I first felt it.</font>

309
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was jealous of the prince.</font>

310
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cherished by the princess,
protected by her, in her embrace.</font>

311
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Had I been weak like him,
would the princess have stayed by my side?</font>

312
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was unmatched in my strength,
which is why no one thought to cherish me.</font>

313
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ages passed, and humans
spread across the globe.</font>

314
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that I would not harm them,
I began living where no humans approached.</font>

315
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's when I first heard it.</font>

316
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rumors of the keeper of the sea's daughter
who went off to a school to become human.</font>

317
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean Minazuki?</font>

318
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew then that I'd found it.</font>

319
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By becoming human, I could
stand on equal footing with them.</font>

320
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To stay by their side forever.</font>

321
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To be cherished by them!</font>

322
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I yearned for their affection.</font>

323
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to become human
and live a life where I fall in love.</font>

324
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You treat people honestly,
even those who aren't human.</font>

325
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You listen to what we
have to say as equals.</font>

326
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I love you,
and want to be loved by you.</font>

327
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has to be you, Mr. Rei.</font>

328
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryuzaki.</font>

329
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. It still stands
that I'm your teacher.</font>

330
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't make advances on a student?</font>

331
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's part of it.</font>

332
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I care for you and the rest of my students
solely as a teacher.</font>

333
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it wouldn't be right to treat one of
you as special by, say, falling in love.</font>

334
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're going to push me away,
then at least be firm about it.</font>

335
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

336
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand. I'm sorry for bothering you.</font>

337
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. I'm used to being alone.</font>

338
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryuzaki.</font>

339
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't fall in love with you.</font>

340
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But romantic feelings aren't
the only reason to stay by someone's side.</font>

341
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As your teacher, I don't
want to see you all alone.</font>

342
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until the day comes that you graduate.</font>

343
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really don't play fair, Mr. Rei.</font>

344
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, I still
can't help but love you.</font>

345
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So until I graduate
and leave this school as a human,</font>

346
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">don't make me give up
on my love for you.</font>

347
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just said you don't want to
see me all alone, didn't you?</font>

348
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ryuzaki...</font>

349
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need to hear your answer.</font>

350
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see you tomorrow!</font>

351
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait!</font>

352
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He turned me down!</font>

353
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karin-rin, you did everything you could.</font>

354
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good job.</font>

355
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can talk it out all you like.</font>

356
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Yeah!</font>

357
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning!</font>

358
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should stop gaming until the last minute
just because the dorm's so close...</font>

359
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Rei! Good morning!</font>

360
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Ryuzaki. Morning.</font>

361
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you today, too!</font>
