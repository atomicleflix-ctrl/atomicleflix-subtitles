1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My knight.</font>

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is not the road we initially took.</font>

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We got new orders.</font>

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no one road for heroes.</font>

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are more people 
on the road with us now.</font>

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The place we're going...</font>

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is holding a bit of a festival.</font>

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Xylo.</font>

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can we take... a break... already?</font>

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We just had one.</font>

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't... go on...</font>

13
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that our destination?</font>

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. That fortress is an important part 
of the Second Capital's defenses.</font>

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A natural stronghold protected
 by a river and sheer cliffs...</font>

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mureed Fortress. Also known
 as the Wayfarer's Nest.</font>

17
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Low prices here!</font>

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything's fresh, but only for today!</font>

19
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Why, you have excellent taste, sir!</font>

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoops. You'll need more military scrip.</font>

21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could I have five of these?</font>

22
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Anyone want to send letters?</font>

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We can take 'em anywhere 
in the Federated Kingdom!</font>

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take this to my mother.</font>

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fresh out of the repair shop 
and indulging already?</font>

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're incorrigible, Dotta.</font>

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's no biggie. They won't get mad
 over a <i>little </i>stealing. It's a festival.</font>

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know we haven't attended the Great Exchange
 in a while, but make sure you don't get caught.</font>

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Verkle Corp merchants are very tight-fisted.</font>

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Aw, c'mon. Loosen up. We don't get 
vacations often, so let's enjoy this one.</font>

31
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Heroes like us don't get vacations.</font>

32
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Even now, we're "on standby."</font>

33
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Of course, that's not to say we're not 
allowed the occasional rest period.</font>

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You sure love to sound smart, Venetim.</font>

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Now if only we could get some girls...</font>

36
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Stop now.</font>

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Even if there were such an establishment 
nearby, <i>we'd</i> never be allowed to use it.</font>

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You got that right.</font>

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander-in-chief! Where are you?</font>

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander Xylo!</font>

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander Xylo.</font>

43
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The traveling merchants have arrived.</font>

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go buy me wine.</font>

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but our treasury's bare.</font>

46
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you forget spending all of our scrip?</font>

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want booze, you'll need 
someone to take out a loan.</font>

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure Venetim's got time to kill.</font>

49
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The chancellor is keeping an eye 
on that sticky-fingered Dotta.</font>

50
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's always got some excuse, huh?</font>

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about Tsav?</font>

52
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's not back from his mission yet?</font>

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, he's still out on loan
 to another unit.</font>

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is insubordination.</font>

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does no one have respect for their king?</font>

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tch. Can't I get a moment's peace
 to do some reading?</font>

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My knight! I have been looking
 for you everywhere.</font>

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a single quiet moment.</font>

59
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The door was unlocked.
Does that not seem incautious?</font>

60
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dotta unlocked it and left. 
He took the key with him.</font>

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My knight, are you not attending 
the Great Exchange?</font>

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna talk to any Holy Knights.</font>

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then come make merry with <i>me</i>!</font>

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why should I?</font>

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just go to the Great Exchange yourself.</font>

66
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I am a goddess, and therefore
have no interest in such things.</font>

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't want a Holy Knight escort, is that it?</font>

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us speak no more of it.</font>

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Instead...</font>

70
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall grant you the honor
 of playing with me.</font>

71
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that not make you happy?</font>

72
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zigg?</font>

73
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Venetim taught me the rules.</font>

74
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall prove a formidable opponent.</font>

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By employing the venerable 
"hidden spear" strategy</font>

76
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">used by the royal family 
in the Kingdom of Meht...</font>

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Don't do that.</font>

78
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Venetim taught you that, 
he was probably messing with you.</font>

79
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, I'm busy right now.</font>

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Reading?</font>

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you not save that for later?</font>

82
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I even made you a bookmark.</font>

83
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't care. Use it yourself.</font>

84
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although I must say, it is a surprise
to see that you love reading.</font>

85
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What manner of boo—</font>

86
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's poetry.</font>

87
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poetry?!</font>

88
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo... Y-You...</font>

89
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the big surprise?</font>

90
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What manner of poetry is it?</font>

91
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall grant you the honor 
of reading it to me.</font>

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rejected.</font>

93
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, at least allow me to read
 over your shoulder.</font>

94
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is surely permissible?</font>

95
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't see what a goddess 
would get out of this.</font>

96
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a book of old poems 
called <i>Dragon-Drunk</i>.</font>

97
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was written by a drunken poet 
by the name of Altoyard Comette.</font>

98
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In his later years, he began 
dreaming of becoming a dragon,</font>

99
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and practiced flying every night 
until it was the death of him.</font>

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a curious story.</font>

101
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There were a lot of poets 
like him back then.</font>

102
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might've been a poet, too, 
if I hadn't joined the military.</font>

103
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A poet?!</font>

104
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the problem? Why is that so—</font>

105
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo Forbartz.</font>

106
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So this is where you were.</font>

107
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't expect Goddess Teoritta
 to be with you.</font>

108
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kivia. I did not expect 
to see you here, either.</font>

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Funny seeing the noble captain of the 
Holy Knights demean herself by coming here.</font>

110
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has our punishment been decided?</font>

111
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or do we have our next mission?</font>

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Both are true.</font>

113
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's not why I'm here.</font>

114
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to talk to you.</font>

115
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To me?</font>

116
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Follow me. I'll unlock—</font>

117
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall accompany you.</font>

118
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It appears the Great Exchange has begun.</font>

119
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us talk as we shop.</font>

120
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Kivia is in attendance, then I, as a goddess,
 will surely be allowed to go.</font>

121
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, it surely must be so.</font>

122
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, let us proceed, my knight.</font>

123
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For heaven's sake.</font>

124
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo, behold!</font>

125
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that some kind of food? 
Or a decoration, perhaps?</font>

126
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's candy. You've never seen it before?</font>

127
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Can-dy"?</font>

128
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This did not exist in the time I was created.</font>

129
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They look very much like jewels.</font>

130
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is that long, thin food?</font>

131
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fried noodles.</font>

132
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A western dish. Cut wheat dough into strips,
 then fry 'em in butter and fermented sauce.</font>

133
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I see.</font>

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that?</font>

135
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look. The one with the bear sign.</font>

136
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

137
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The hell? I've never seen that before.</font>

138
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miwoolies Creams.</font>

139
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An iced treat popular in the First Capital.</font>

140
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shaved ice is placed atop whipped cream, 
then sprinkled with honey and nuts.</font>

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The flavor is exquisite.</font>

142
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That bear is their mascot. 
They're currently holding a contest to name it.</font>

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magnificent. The constant advancement 
in culture is on full display!</font>

144
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never heard of it.</font>

145
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surprised you have.</font>

146
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why wouldn't I know it?
 I enjoy iced treats as much as anyone.</font>

147
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What exactly is going through
 your head right now?</font>

148
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My knight.</font>

149
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks delicious, does it not, Xylo? 
Truly delicious indeed.</font>

150
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? Do you not wish to try it?</font>

151
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you insist.</font>

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pick out two you think look good.</font>

153
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, three?</font>

154
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll pass. I'm saving my scrip.</font>

155
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You heard her. Just the two.</font>

156
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead.</font>

157
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

158
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave it to me!</font>

159
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo. You've given me reason
 to reevaluate you.</font>

160
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You saved my men at Couveunge.</font>

161
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At Zewan Gan, you saved the people 
we were ready to abandon.</font>

162
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the people you saved were all grateful.</font>

163
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

164
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess it wasn't for nothing, then.</font>

165
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see you're capable of smiling, at least.</font>

166
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's just too many things that piss me off.</font>

167
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Regardless, you've proven 
yourself quite capable.</font>

168
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And by forming that pact 
with Goddess Teoritta,</font>

169
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe you may have saved her, too.</font>

170
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that mean?</font>

171
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goddess Teoritta was discovered 
in the northern ruins.</font>

172
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After her excavation, we of the Thirteenth Order
 of Holy Knights, assigned to pact with her,</font>

173
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">were dispatched to handle 
oversight and operations.</font>

174
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But conflict soon arose between 
the military and the Temple.</font>

175
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to hear it.</font>

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you! It's because of <i>you</i>! 
Because you killed Goddess Senerva!</font>

177
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

178
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That incident gave the military an idea.</font>

179
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"If goddesses can be killed,</font>

180
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">maybe we can make more goddesses."</font>

181
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the military wanted us
 to analyze Teoritta.</font>

182
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Analyze her, huh?</font>

183
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dissect her, you mean.</font>

184
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, the Temple opposed it,</font>

185
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the military won out.</font>

186
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, that situation 
is now beginning to change.</font>

187
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In a very short time, 
your unit has taken out two Demon Lords,</font>

188
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and proved the usefulness 
of Goddess Teoritta.</font>

189
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her usefulness?</font>

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're saying they thought 
she was useless before?</font>

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'd just found her. How would they know?</font>

192
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We knew her power was to summon swords.</font>

193
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was written in the ruins
 where she was found.</font>

194
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's said the goddesses first came to us
 during the First War of Subjugation,</font>

195
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in what is known as the Great Civilized Era.</font>

196
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The goddesses act as a kind of "gate," 
with each one having a different nature.</font>

197
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One produces various poisons.</font>

198
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One calls down lightning and raging storms.</font>

199
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One sees the future.</font>

200
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They awaken in response to Demon Blights,</font>

201
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and when their task is finished, 
they return to sleep in their coffins.</font>

202
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know about the goddesses' powers.</font>

203
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They say one of the goddesses brought 
Tatsuya here from another world, too.</font>

204
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was judged that the ability
 to summon swords</font>

205
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was far weaker than the abilities 
of the twelve other goddesses.</font>

206
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And despite knowing what was to become 
of Goddess Teoritta, we still...</font>

207
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that explains it.</font>

208
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So your suicidal plan in Couveunge 
was an attempt at atonement.</font>

209
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Disgusting. Just because 
she's not useful as a goddess...</font>

210
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you are, dear.</font>

211
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

212
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Xylo! I have made the purchase!</font>

213
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bought one for Kivia, too.</font>

214
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come, you two, let us—</font>

215
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me about our next mission.</font>

216
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

217
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we do good there, 
she won't get dissected, right?</font>

218
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what kind of 
"usefulness" they're after,</font>

219
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'll make those Galtuile 
bastards choke on it.</font>

220
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's defense.</font>

221
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This fortress will be defended 
by your hero unit.</font>

222
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To the death.</font>

223
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To the death?</font>

224
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

225
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll defend that fortress from the Demon
 Blight by yourselves and to the bitter end.</font>

226
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it's a literal suicide mission?</font>

227
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay calm, Xylo. Don't snap
 and beat anyone to death—</font>

228
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who the hell do you think I am?</font>

229
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me. Could you perhaps enlighten us
on the details of this particular plan?</font>

230
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll stay here at the fortress. That's all.</font>

231
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A war of attrition, then.</font>

232
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long do you want us to hold out?</font>

233
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Until you die.</font>

234
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Ninth and Thirteenth Orders will be
 at the rear, conserving their strength.</font>

235
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once you're all dead and the fortress is taken,
 they'll execute a special attack.</font>

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what might this "special attack" be?</font>

237
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poison.</font>

238
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ninth goddess will perform 
a miracle for all to see.</font>

239
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you think that'll kill the Demon Lord?</font>

240
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear you've been throwing 
all kinds of stuff at that thing</font>

241
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without ever managing to take it down.</font>

242
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

243
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our last plan was to use a sniper to deliver
the goddess's deadly poison directly,</font>

244
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that just put it into a torpor 
it soon recovered from.</font>

245
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So not even Tsav could put it down?</font>

246
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Between that result and 
the third goddess's future-sight powers,</font>

247
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Galtuile decided to revise the plan.</font>

248
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll set a massive poison trap here
 in Mureed Fortress,</font>

249
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and kill the Demon Lord <i>continuously</i>.</font>

250
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you plan to overwhelm 
its incredible regenerative abilities.</font>

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And we're just there 
to buy some time, then die?</font>

252
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

253
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let Mureed Fortress become the eternal resting 
place for Demon Blight Number Fifteen, "Iblis."</font>

254
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me, Commander?</font>

255
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why can't we simply leave after luring 
the Demon Lord into the trap?</font>

256
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because those were Galtuile's orders.</font>

257
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If any of you leave the fortress,</font>

258
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the sacred seals on your necks 
will kill the whole unit instantly.</font>

259
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The whole unit, you say?</font>

260
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that necessary?</font>

261
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there some reason you'd prefer us dead?</font>

262
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They hate us that much?</font>

263
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood. We'll carry out the plan.</font>

264
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'd like to discuss 
a few revisions, if I may.</font>

265
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Revisions?</font>

266
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rule that we all die if even one of us
 leaves the fortress, for instance.</font>

267
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That seems highly counterproductive.</font>

268
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

269
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're antisocial criminal 
miscreants, remember?</font>

270
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can expect at least one of our number
 to try to save his own skin,</font>

271
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">making it impossible to carry out the plan.</font>

272
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I propose a change.</font>

273
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should kill us if we <i>all</i> leave the 
fortress at once, rather than just one of us.</font>

274
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would substantially increase 
our chances of success.</font>

275
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, and regarding Goddess Teoritta...</font>

276
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our goddess is a kind, compassionate soul.</font>

277
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if we order her away, 
she will surely wish to remain with us.</font>

278
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I request permission for her to stay.</font>

279
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not authorized to make that call.</font>

280
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-The goddess is under the jurisdiction 
of the Thirteenth Or—</font>

281
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Xylo.</font>

282
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Contact Captain Kivia at once.</font>

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

284
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What else do you want me to get?</font>

285
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Soldiers. We don't have enough.</font>

286
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood. What else?</font>

287
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weapons and provisions.</font>

288
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood. What else?</font>

289
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A pardon.</font>

290
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood. What else?</font>

291
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forget the pardon.</font>

292
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want cavalry and artillery if possible.</font>

293
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you call Jayce and Rhyno back?</font>

294
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're still on the western front.</font>

295
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might get Tsav back, though.</font>

296
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsav, huh?</font>

297
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what are you two muttering about?</font>

298
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Really, Xylo. That's not 
where Captain Kivia's room is.</font>

299
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right.</font>

300
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll get it all handled.</font>

301
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can trust me.</font>

302
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't trust you one bit.</font>

303
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you really get this done?</font>

304
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, let's just say...</font>

305
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of you might not believe me,</font>

306
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but despite how I look,</font>

307
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was on the verge
 of saving the world once.</font>

308
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a dreary place.</font>

309
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't be taken for a proper trial, then?</font>

310
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A thousand pardons, Venetim Leopool.</font>

311
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would have preferred to talk 
in a slightly nicer room.</font>

312
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've honestly been wanting to meet you.</font>

313
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I actually respect you.</font>

314
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Respect me? You want to make 
a living as a con man as well?</font>

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really shouldn't respect me, then.</font>

316
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got caught, after all.</font>

317
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. You're totally right.</font>

318
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And as far as my crime goes,</font>

319
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose trying to sell the palace off 
to the circus was a bridge too far.</font>

320
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. You really elevated fraud 
to a whole new level, didn't you?</font>

321
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to sell the land to 
a circus performing in the area,</font>

322
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you fabricated a story about 
the whole capital being relocated.</font>

323
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very impressive.</font>

324
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was going to take the advance payment 
and split, but it got out of hand.</font>

325
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Investment fraud. Forgery. Counterfeiting.</font>

326
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have at least a hundred complaints 
from the Verkle Development Corporation.</font>

327
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Truly, I am.</font>

328
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want your apologies.</font>

329
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly, what inspired you
 to become a con man?</font>

330
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I've always hated 
seeing people look disappointed.</font>

331
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd make up whatever lie 
would get me through a situation,</font>

332
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and even try to make it all consistent.</font>

333
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must have taken a lot of effort.</font>

334
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed you managed to keep 
a plan of this scale consistent, too.</font>

335
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

336
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, uh, should I be expecting 
the death penalty?</font>

337
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm afraid not.</font>

338
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't actually going 
to be punished for the fraud.</font>

339
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not for the fraud? Then, why—</font>

340
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The real problem is right here.</font>

341
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That third-rate paper I worked for?</font>

342
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about it?</font>

343
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an article you wrote.</font>

344
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It says spies under the influence of 
the Demon Blight, pretending to be human,</font>

345
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">have infiltrated the Temple, Galtuile, 
and even the royal family.</font>

346
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:00,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I do believe I wrote that. They'd run out 
of scandals about Holy Knights and goddesses,</font>

347
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as well as stuff the royal family had done.</font>

348
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They told me they wanted an article 
that would inspire fear in the populace.</font>

349
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, to be honest...</font>

350
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fraud isn't a problem. Nor are forgery, 
inflated scandals, or conspiracy theories.</font>

351
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are all fine by us.</font>

352
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

353
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't have you telling the truth.</font>

354
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, in particular, are capable of convincing 
people of the most outrageous things.</font>

355
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least, you're skilled enough 
to make us think you are.</font>

356
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait a minute. 
Hold on just a second. I—</font>

357
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To keep you from ever speaking 
the truth in the future,</font>

358
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we'll include a special feature 
in your sacred seal.</font>

359
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? W-Wait—</font>

360
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm afraid the death penalty
is too good for you.</font>

361
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Wait just a minute!</font>

362
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You can't.</font>

363
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't... I don't know anything.</font>

364
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just didn't want to disappoint them.</font>

365
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Venetim Leopool.</font>

366
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:12,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am sentencing you to be a hero.</font>

367
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe he got us everything 
I asked for except the pardon.</font>

368
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If the goddess is in danger, 
Venetim'll be the one to get her out, right?</font>

369
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's one clever dude.</font>

370
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That guy will get himself killed 
"in the chaos of the battlefield" someday.</font>

371
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I suppose Tsav has already arrived?</font>

372
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, probably.</font>

373
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think that guy might 
be worse than Venetim.</font>

374
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That Tsav... He's just so volatile.</font>

375
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He did it again!</font>

376
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The man's unstoppable!</font>

377
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the seventh in a row!</font>

378
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another winning roll!</font>

379
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like the pot's mine.</font>

380
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on. Pony up the scrip.</font>

381
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, is this what you're doin'?</font>

382
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got a problem?</font>

383
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, ya see...</font>

384
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As it happens, I've got good eyes and ears.</font>

385
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm also a total good guy, see? The kind who 
can't stand to see wrongdoers go unpunished.</font>

386
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, if you'll just drop the scrip 
and scram, I won't hafta—</font>

387
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bastard.</font>

388
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut your mouth right now!</font>

389
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take back those damn lies or I'll—</font>

390
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one wants this, right?</font>

391
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The naughty hand of a fraudster.</font>

392
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, I warned ya, man.</font>

393
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway...</font>

394
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm hungry.</font>
