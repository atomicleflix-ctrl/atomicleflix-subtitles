1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can go home soon!</font>

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna get home! I wanna get home soon!</font>

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah!</font>

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To Snowfield!!</font>

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}This is...</font>

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}definitely beyond the confines
of ordinary Magecraft.</font>

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cavalryman... Rider?</font>

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such thrilling music!</font>

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was truly a wonderful experience!</font>

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First and foremost,
let's form an alliance with someone!</font>

12
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, you won't be going there?</font>

13
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Due to the events from a
previous Holy Grail War,</font>

14
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a Lord is not allowed onsite.</font>

15
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what the Clock Tower decided.</font>

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have some new information?</font>

17
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

18
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you should be
the first person to know.</font>

19
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Baleman.</font>

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Several hours ago,
a certain indie band uploaded this video.</font>

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First the news, now video streaming.</font>

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look! Right here!</font>

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sajyou?</font>

24
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong, Ayaka?</font>

25
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

26
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have an uneasy look on your face.</font>

27
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If there's something worrying you,
don't hesitate to tell me.</font>

28
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I said it's fine.</font>

29
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, perhaps you're tired?</font>

30
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You weren't able to sleep
at the music club, either.</font>

31
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jeez!</font>

32
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have nothing but uncertainties!</font>

33
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't there another Master
hiding here or something?</font>

34
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right! This Magical Energy
enveloping the entire forest</font>

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is almost like a bounded field!</font>

36
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What if, maybe, they attack us?</font>

37
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they felt so inclined,
they would have done it long ago!</font>

38
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How can you have so much faith?</font>

39
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Huh?</font>

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I can't see Saber anymore!</font>

41
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did that weird Saber show up
instead of Altry?</font>

42
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you use as the catalyst?</font>

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They said the sheath
for the legendary sword was gone...</font>

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I used the box that it was sealed in.</font>

45
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I totally thought we'd
be able to summon Altry!</font>

46
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jeez!</font>

47
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This forest is annoying!</font>

48
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello!</font>

49
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What have you come to me for?</font>

50
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what kind of being you are...</font>

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I wanted to make a request
to the first Servant I came across!</font>

52
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Servant?</font>

53
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any interest
in forming an alliance with us?</font>

54
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind...</font>

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but will my Master gain
anything from that?</font>

56
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to talk to your Master, as well.</font>

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they not here with you? Huh?</font>

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a wonderful Master.</font>

59
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're not particularly fond of humans.</font>

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But your Master seems to be an exception.</font>

61
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Perhaps because she's
not much like a Master.</font>

62
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Well, actually she's not a Master at all.</font>

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's get back on topic.</font>

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I saw a monster last night.</font>

65
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This Holy Grail War...</font>

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has either gotten roped into
some tremendous trouble,</font>

67
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or it's being used for something.</font>

68
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}In either case, why don't we
eliminate them together and start clean?</font>

69
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The way things are going now,</font>

70
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}if I were to lose, I can't
say Ayaka will be safe</font>

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}even if she evacuates to the Church.</font>

72
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You seem to cherish your
Master quite a bit.</font>

73
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She got roped into this because of me.</font>

74
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I didn't take
responsibility for that...</font>

75
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the people who inherited
lineage of my clan...</font>

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and...</font>

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the name of the great first king
will be tarnished.</font>

78
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Interesting.</font>

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You surely are a king yourself, but of
a different type than the king I know.</font>

80
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially the part that you seem to have
an exceptional number of friends.</font>

81
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so? I'd think
you have more friends than I do.</font>

82
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe that anything
living on this earth is a friend.</font>

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Although my feelings are
often unreciprocated.</font>

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But a close friend that I can disclose
what goes on in my heart to...</font>

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That, I decided will be just one person.</font>

86
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Woah, come now. Is this
negotiation a failure?</font>

87
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or is it...</font>

88
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That close friend is quite a fussy guy.</font>

89
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're weak, you'd just be killed.</font>

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to test whether or not...</font>

91
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you can fight against him.</font>

92
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love things that are easy to understand.</font>

93
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I basically have to prove
my strength, right?</font>

94
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hold on! What are you guys—</font>

95
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry, Ayaka.</font>

96
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is just a trial to form an alliance.</font>

97
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now...</font>

98
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}let's start this battle!</font>

99
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hey, Brother!</i></font>

100
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That Saber sword arrived.</i></font>

101
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't a Noble Phantasm or anything.
It's just a decorated sword.</font>

102
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But he supposedly destroyed
the Opera House</font>

103
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with a single strike from that sword.</font>

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}A knight with red streaks
in his blond hair...</font>

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}This is most likely Lionheart.</font>

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yeah, <i>that </i>Lionheart.</font>

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see, you conclude so, as well?</i></font>

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. Lionheart was a
total King Arthur freak.</font>

109
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some say he pretended to live
a fast life, but in reality,</font>

110
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">went on to search around
for King Arthur's fortune.</font>

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>However, isn't he a hero from an era</i></font>

112
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>where the Mystics have
relatively thinned out?</i></font>

113
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Brother.</font>

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lionheart was called the "Wandering King"
in my era, ya know.</font>

115
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Indeed, it's said the time
he stayed within his country</i></font>

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>during his 10-year reign
was less than one year.</i></font>

117
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I mean!</font>

118
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm talking about the border
between mythology and history.</font>

119
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's part of both eras...</font>

120
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the final king from
a time when Mystics</font>

121
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">like Elementals and Rune Magecraft
still openly endured.</font>

122
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Loxley!</font>

123
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're quick. Is that
physical strengthening Magecraft?</font>

124
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not mine, though.</font>

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you...</font>

126
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">take lessons in fistfighting?</font>

127
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a combination of techniques I saw
earlier in what they call "movies"...</font>

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">along with my combat style!</font>

129
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such mobility despite that. Amazing.</font>

130
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be a bit more serious...</font>

131
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as a Lancer-class.</font>

132
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Saber!</font>

133
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you!</font>

134
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess making do
with shallow knowledge won't work.</font>

135
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From here, as a Saber-class...</font>

136
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall use my sword!</font>

137
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always wanted to do this once.</font>

138
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mimicking the Knight of
the Lake who defeated</font>

139
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">his enemies with a branch he picked up...</font>

140
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">saying, "A knight does
not die empty-handed."</font>

141
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey Brother, let me tell
you an interesting tale!</font>

142
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just how crazy he was for King Arthur...</font>

143
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Things got so bad that he named everything
he owned after that sacred sword.</font>

144
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His sword, of course,
but also a knife, parchment,</font>

145
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">even a stick that was lying about.</font>

146
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This sword is...</i></font>

147
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>a road to glory, seeking a miracle!</i></font>

148
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A crystallization of
faith honoring that will!</i></font>

149
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sadly enough, the noble dream...</i></font>

150
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>leads to the ends unhindered by anyone!</i></font>

151
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Engraved once again...</i></font>

152
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>this sword is the one and only...</i></font>

153
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ex...</i></font>

154
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>calibur!</i></font>

155
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on now.</font>

156
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That looks useful for cracking walnuts.</font>

157
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This much power with a tree branch, huh?</font>

158
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do I pass the test?</font>

159
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems you haven't unleashed
even half of your strength.</font>

160
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You are strong.</font>

161
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Though I don't know...</font>

162
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what my friend would say.</font>

163
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayaka! We have safely formed an alliance!</font>

164
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Safely?</font>

165
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You guys were trying to kill each other.</font>

166
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, there are trials out in the world
that you risk your life for.</font>

167
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give me a break!</font>

168
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't be angry at him.</font>

169
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was being reckless for your sake.</font>

170
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know... do people say
you're terrible at reading the room?</font>

171
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The gods often said so.</font>

172
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like when I defeated a bull.</font>

173
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Defeated a bull?
Can you tell me that story in detail?</font>

174
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of bull? How and what did you—</font>

175
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow!</font>

176
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please stop, Ayaka!</font>

177
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ouch! Ouch!</font>

178
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was my fault!</font>

179
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would you do something like that?</font>

180
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, you ask?</font>

181
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand that you're trying
to do something for someone like me...</font>

182
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but...</font>

183
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't ask you to do that!</font>

184
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you, right?</font>

185
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to look after
you on my own will.</font>

186
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you need Magical Energy,</font>

187
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you can use Magecraft or whatever
and turn me into a puppet!</font>

188
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you trusted...</font>

189
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}someone like me.</font>

190
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I appreciate what you did. I do. But...</font>

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not worthy of something like that.</font>

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't deserve to be
protected by someone...</font>

193
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or to be trusted.</font>

194
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, do you know about Little Red Riding
Hood of the Semina Apartments?</font>

195
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A married couple and a girl
moved in next to Mr. A.</font>

196
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girl was being abused
and always hid her wounds with a red hood.</font>

197
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That girl had been asking Mr. A
at the elevator...</font>

198
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Hey, can you push the button?"</font>

199
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One day, that family
attempted murder-suicide.</font>

200
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The girl sought help,
but Mr. A ignored her,</font>

201
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">thinking it had nothing to do with him.</font>

202
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the day the girl went missing,</font>

203
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the sound of someone knocking
on the door echoed around.</font>

204
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When Mr. A finally opened that door...</font>

205
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, can you push the button?</font>

206
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}"HEY, CAN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON?"</font>

207
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard that's based on an incident
that actually happened.</font>

208
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened in the end again?</font>

209
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Didn't they end up missing?</font>

210
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}STOP</font>

211
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've heard an ending
that they fled overseas.</font>

212
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe they're still running away
from Little Red Riding Hood to this day!</font>

213
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're being so kind to me like this...</font>

214
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I'm sure I'll betray others again.</font>

215
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I might sell you to the
enemy and flee by myself!</font>

216
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might sell me to the enemy?</font>

217
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayaka, you really do worry
about the little things.</font>

218
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Little things?</font>

219
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It happens often.</font>

220
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was almost sold off to Rome
by my own little brother.</font>

221
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That... has nothing to do with me!</font>

222
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does involve you!</font>

223
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have lived a life where it's no longer
a surprise for anyone to betray me.</font>

224
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Can it be...</font>

225
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}that you have mistaken me for a good man?</font>

226
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

227
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, what you have done doesn't...</font>

228
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">War.</font>

229
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was all I could do.</font>

230
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}People forming an alliance with us
shouldn't be making such solemn faces.</font>

231
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd like, have some, too.</font>

232
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why is she here?</font>

233
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You lot...</font>

234
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">will defeat the monster?</font>

235
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it harms people!</font>

236
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lionheart, I have heard about you.</font>

237
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How you fought such monsters
together with one of our leaders. And...</font>

238
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what a terrifying man you used to be.</font>

239
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My objective differs from you.</font>

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I must defeat that monster first.</font>

241
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, it's a temporary ceasefire.</font>

242
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, there is a monster
I want to rid from this city, as well.</font>

243
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The monster you speak of seems
even more troublesome than Dead Apostles.</font>

244
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not necessarily true.</font>

245
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now, it's just a black curse
and a dark brown clump of mud.</font>

246
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If those two fused together
and seeped into the Holy Grail...</font>

247
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this planet itself might be
in a little bit of danger.</font>

248
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It seems my friend has found
a good partner to warm up with.</font>

249
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiné, work up plenty of
Magical Energy for now.</font>

250
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even I can't imagine just how much
I will be spending from hereon out.</font>

251
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please use your powers
as much as you wish.</font>

252
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if my body were to perish.</font>

253
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't speak of such nonsense.</font>

254
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you are worried
that the cavalry girl made light of you...</font>

255
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that is called "audacity."</font>

256
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter your resolve,</font>

257
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when faced with a powerful opponent,
a child is still a child.</font>

258
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

259
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am the leader of the
guardians of this land.</font>

260
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I obtained my power by
sacrificing the lives</font>

261
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">of my 12 elder brothers
and nine elder sisters...</font>

262
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as well as my own body.</font>

263
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This life exists only to regain Snowfield,
which is the earnest wish of my clan.</font>

264
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When opposing a proud warrior,</font>

265
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they will respect and fight you
regardless of age or appearance.</font>

266
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, though you may
have gathered your resolve,</font>

267
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't quite say you are a proud one yet.</font>

268
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those who lack self-esteem
will lack it even in old age.</font>

269
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Self-esteem, you say?</font>

270
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On that point, you are fortunate!</font>

271
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if temporary,
you are one of my subjects.</font>

272
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In a few days, the fact
that you were able to sear</font>

273
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">my glory into memory will
be something to be proud of!</font>

274
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

275
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no doubt about it.</font>

276
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her hair color is different,
but that is Ayaka Sajyou.</font>

277
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I informed you the other day, right?</font>

278
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That someone who is on-site
has seen one of your apprentices, Lord.</font>

279
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And by that, you didn't mean Flat?</font>

280
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We meant her.</font>

281
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's true that Sajyou was a part
of my class for about a month.</font>

282
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

283
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}it's faster to confirm
it with her directly.</font>

284
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's confirm the directive!</font>

285
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now, we will form an alliance until
the three threats have been dealt with.</font>

286
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that fine?</font>

287
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

288
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My top priority is still
the safety of my Master,</font>

289
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I can't move out of
this forest just yet.</font>

290
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I would like to find
a base with some bedding.</font>

291
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For that, I know of a place.</font>

292
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The spot where I was summoned.</font>

293
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

294
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayaka should be able to rest here!</font>

295
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Phew, I'm so glad! Rest is important!</font>

296
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Saber... You know...</font>

297
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone's here.</font>

298
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

299
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayaka! Head to a place where you can hide!</font>

300
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? H-Hold on!</font>

301
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run for it!</font>

302
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you stay here—</font>

303
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you stop me?</font>

304
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This guy told Ayaka to run for it.</font>

305
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We might be able to talk
it out with him, right?</font>

306
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a Saber-class Servant.</font>

307
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice meeting you!</font>

308
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now...</font>

309
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">can you listen to what we have to say?</font>

310
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This over here is my
Master... well, not quite.</font>

311
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

312
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayaka?</font>

313
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Are you going to seriously look for it?</i></font>

314
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This so-called fortune of King Arthur?</i></font>

315
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>Of course!</i></font>

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>As long as I find something,
I don't care what.</i></font>

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<i>It would be the best
if that was Excalibur!</i></font>

318
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hey there, amusing, pleasant folks!</i></font>

319
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You jumped right into the trap
I set up without any doubt!</i></font>

320
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My utmost respect for you lot

322
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thank you for asking!</i></font>

335
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you hurt anywhere?</font>

336
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Saber, do you like King Arthur?</font>

337
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayaka, are you also a fan of King Arthur?</font>

338
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think King Arthur's great, too!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I meant.</font>

340
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I see.</font>

341
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not dawn yet. You
should rest a bit more.</font>

342
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know...</font>

343
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">sorry about earlier.</font>

344
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was there something
you need to apologize for?</font>

345
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well... how I yelled, pulled your hair,</font>

346
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,980

all sorts of stuff.</font>

347
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such trivial things.</font>

348
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I should apologize, too.</font>

349
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't think about your feelings and
revealed my name without permission</font>

350
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and asked for an alliance.</font>

351
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to apologize about that!</font>

352
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever you do, I won't say
it's none of your business anymore.</font>

353
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, at the least, tell me
if you're doing something dangerous.</font>

354
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to at least try to stop you.</font>

355
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'd be troubled if you died on your
own and I couldn't tell you "Thank you."</font>

356
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. I have always troubled someone.</font>

357
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know your "always."
And that's not what I mean.</font>

358
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is me being selfish, too.</font>

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My husband is acting weird!</font>

362
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,320

going to leave the city!</font>
