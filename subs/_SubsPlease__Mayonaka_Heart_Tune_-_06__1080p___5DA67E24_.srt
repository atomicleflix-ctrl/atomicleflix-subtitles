1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, all right, then.</font>

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's begin the Ultra Awesome Sports 
Day Celebration Party (as named by Iko).</font>

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're doing this 
at your place, Lemon-chan?</font>

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's cheaper to drink at home.</font>

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yikes. She's already drinking,
so no toast.</font>

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd you make us change 
into these clothes?</font>

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">School rules would be a pain 
if you were in uniform.</font>

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just say you're visiting 
an older friend today.</font>

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The teachers' exam 
must be bugged if she passed it.</font>

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got a nice place, Lemon-chan.</font>

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's gonna give the toast?</font>

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who else but yours truly?</font>

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take it away, President.</font>

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good job, everyone. 
Especially you, Shinobu.</font>

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A toast to Lemon-chan, 
who's paying for everything.</font>

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cheers!</font>

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm paying? But I'm broke and 
waiting for payday.</font>

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is punishment 
for slacking on advisor work.</font>

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for treating us.</font>

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine, whatever.</font>

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway...</font>

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said to change into something comfy.</font>

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you went all-out with those outfits.</font>

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you all dressed to kill?</font>

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, I get it.</font>

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good for you, Yamabuki.</font>

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can produce an heir for your family.</font>

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha? What are you trying to say?!</font>

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You girls must've panicked because 
someone made a proxy confession to him.</font>

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, youth.</font>

33
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It has nothing to do with him. 
This is just how I normally dress.</font>

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I just grabbed 
whatever was nearby, too.</font>

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just wanted to wear some new clothes.</font>

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at you, making excuses. 
At least come up with some better ones.</font>

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what's your excuse, Rikka?</font>

38
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I picked this out hoping 
Yamabuki-kun would call me cute.</font>

39
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You heard her, Yamabuki. What do you say?</font>

40
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's asleep!</font>

41
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess he did run around a lot.</font>

42
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe he fell asleep 
in a woman's apartment.</font>

43
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too bad for you, Rikka.</font>

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh...</font>

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You let a good chance slip, Yamabuki-kun. 
You'll never see me in this outfit again.</font>

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, the odd one's out for the count.</font>

47
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's have ourselves a girls-only party.</font>

48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we go buy some food first?</font>

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about we each bring 
something we'd like to share?</font>

50
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds good to me.</font>

51
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do we do about Bucky?</font>

52
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just put him on the bed.</font>

53
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your place is fancier 
than I expected, Lemon-chan.</font>

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know about growing bean 
sprouts in the bathroom, though.</font>

55
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong with that? 
Easy access to water.</font>

56
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to ask you something,</font>

57
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you had to go and fall asleep.</font>

58
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say, why did Shinobu 
hug you during the event?</font>

59
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two have always hit it off. 
Are you dating or something?</font>

60
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Iko's back.</font>

61
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}NENE SAW</font>

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you two kissed and stuff?</font>

63
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hoo boy, I forgot my wallet!</font>

64
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I set a new world
record for being forgetful!</font>

65
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Welcome back, Nene.</font>

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

67
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were here, Iko? 
I just came back to grab my wallet.</font>

68
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you taking a break?</font>

69
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yep.</font>

70
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What'd you buy?</font>

71
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a secret.</font>

72
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on, tell me.</font>

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, did I just try to get in Iko's way?</i></font>

74
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why? Because she was gonna kiss him? 
But it's got nothing to do with me.</i></font>

75
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey...</font>

76
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long have you been here?</font>

77
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?!</font>

78
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Uh, I just got back!</font>

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't see or hear anything!</font>

80
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dropped my contacts, 
and my ears are full of fluff!</font>

81
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, have you ever kissed anyone?</font>

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And here I was trying so hard 
to change the topic!</i></font>

83
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where'd that come from?</font>

84
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno. Just felt like asking.</font>

85
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have, yeah.</font>

86
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? Who? And when?</font>

87
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was fairly recently.</font>

88
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If that one counts.</i></font>

89
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so grown-up.</font>

90
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have, huh? Wow.</font>

91
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, Iko...</font>

92
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you like the errand boy here?</font>

93
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you ask?</font>

94
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, you were about 
to kiss him earlier.</font>

95
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You saw that? Y-You big fat liar!</font>

96
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said you didn't see anything!</font>

97
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I have 20/20 vision!</font>

98
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your fault for being so careless.</font>

99
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa, Iko?!</font>

100
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think it's like that, but I dunno.</font>

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've always been a recluse, 
so it's the first time I've felt this way.</font>

102
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have feelings for Bucky?</font>

103
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not really. I really hate all boys.</font>

104
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... well,</font>

105
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's better than the other 
boys I know, at least.</font>

106
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you saying...</font>

107
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back!</font>

108
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nene-chan? Iko-chan?</font>

109
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

110
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weird.</font>

111
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their shoes are here. 
Did they go out in slippers?</font>

112
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess I'm the first one back, then.</font>

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are we hiding?</font>

114
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno!</font>

115
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamabuki-kun's still asleep, huh?</font>

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's too bad. I even bought 
something nice for you.</font>

117
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thing is,</font>

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I owe you two apologies.</font>

119
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, I'm sorry for hugging you.</font>

120
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought we were done for,</font>

121
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so you were basically my savior.</font>

122
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you didn't mind.</font>

123
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I certainly didn't.</font>

124
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other thing I must apologize for...</font>

125
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is lying to you.</font>

126
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're partners in crime, 
but there's something I didn't tell you.</font>

127
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe I'll fess up now.</font>

128
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You see,</font>

129
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">back during the confession event...</font>

130
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm back!</font>

131
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Nobody home?</font>

132
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weird.</font>

133
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did they go out in slippers?</font>

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you two hiding?</font>

135
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno!</font>

136
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you hiding, Shinobu?!</font>

137
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno!</font>

138
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess I'm the first one back.</font>

139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's still asleep?</font>

140
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? I got you something nice, too.</font>

141
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

142
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, such a shame.</font>

143
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've gone and changed.</font>

144
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sulking 'cause you 
didn't compliment me.</font>

145
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, wait. You can't hear me.</font>

146
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, you're still playing the guitar?</font>

147
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm actually writing a song right now.</font>

148
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I think I've hit a wall.</font>

149
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Achoo!</font>

150
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What in the world are you doing?</font>

151
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crap, I fell asleep.</font>

152
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What's with this weird mood?</font>

153
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter? 
Surely you're not fighting.</font>

154
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did fight.</font>

155
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You did?!</font>

156
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not why, though.</font>

157
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not?!</font>

158
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We agreed to each buy something we like, 
but we all bought the same thing.</font>

159
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, but how'd you all end up 
buying whole-ass cakes?</font>

160
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you want to eat cake that badly?</font>

161
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you worked really hard, 
so I wanted to thank you.</font>

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to celebrate our success, yep.</font>

163
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were tired, so I figured 
something sweet might help.</font>

164
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just bought it because I wanted some.</font>

165
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But four cakes is too many, huh?</font>

166
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He dug in quick!</font>

167
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yours truly just happened to have 
the mother of all sugar cravings.</font>

168
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Four cakes might not even 
be enough to satisfy it.</font>

169
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamabuki-kun...</font>

170
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't force yourself.</font>

171
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't make me laugh—</font>

172
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what I'd call...</font>

173
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rejoice!</font>

174
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I bought cake!</font>

175
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the treat.</font>

176
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, wow.</font>

177
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was moved by your efforts.</font>

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many calories was that?</font>

179
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you okay?</font>

180
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No problem at all. That was delicious.</font>

181
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat my cake next, then.</font>

182
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My heart seeks entertainment. 
This is a celebration.</font>

183
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Simply eating and drinking 
would be a waste.</font>

184
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He noped out.</font>

185
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something that would bring 
the members closer together...</font>

186
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about we play a game of some sort?</font>

187
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good idea. Let's do it.</font>

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna play Cats'n'Dragons.</font>

189
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any games, Lemon-chan?</font>

190
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I do have some stuff 
for drinking games.</font>

191
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The loser has to eat this in one go.</font>

192
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The devil is among us!</font>

193
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't just decide the punishment first!</font>

194
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're joining us, right?</font>

195
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I pass. I avoid carbs past 8 PM.</font>

196
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And beer doesn't count? 
How did she become a teacher?</font>

197
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which one are we playing?</font>

198
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one for sure. 
I don't wanna use my brain.</font>

199
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And someone's probably good at it.</font>

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Smart. Yours truly hasn't lost a game 
of Concentration in my 17 years of life.</font>

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your first turn. Don't overthink it.</font>

202
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go for it, Nene-chan.</font>

203
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Softly...</font>

204
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Softly...</font>

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heck yeah!</font>

206
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm done.</font>

207
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was quick!</font>

208
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me next.</font>

209
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't play analog games like this often.</font>

210
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

211
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's exciting, huh?</font>

212
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha?</font>

213
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yikes, you're going there already?</font>

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I upped the difficulty.</font>

215
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking no prisoners, huh?</font>

216
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your move, Yamabuki-kun?</font>

217
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm.</font>

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Am I allowed to touch as many blocks 
as I want, as many times as I want?</font>

219
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you say, ref?</font>

220
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemon-chan's the ref?</font>

221
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't see why not.</font>

222
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have the ref's permission. Here I go.</font>

223
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't poke around too much. 
You'll make it collapse.</font>

224
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oho?</font>

225
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're an expert at this, Yamabuki.</font>

226
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please. We Yamabukis 
just play it occasionally.</font>

227
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Three blocks on each level. 
Fifty-four blocks in total.</i></font>

228
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In this old-school balancing game, 
each block appears to be the same...</i></font>

229
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but they're slightly different 
in size and thickness!</i></font>

230
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So you go for the slightly thinner ones!</i></font>

231
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's next?</font>

232
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead.</font>

233
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get all smug on me! 
You're pissing me off!</font>

234
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He thinks he's got this in the bag.</font>

235
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamabuki-kun's a tough nut to crack, huh?</font>

236
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, he hasn't noticed I changed.</font>

237
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time to get serious, I guess.</font>

238
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Crap. All that cake's making me drowsy.</i></font>

239
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you hurry up?</font>

240
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>One of these four is Apollo.</i></font>

241
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That'll work.</font>

242
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about over here?</font>

243
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can do it.</font>

244
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno about that one.</font>

245
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Long time no talk.</i></font>

246
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Back then, it was definitely her 
on the other side of the door.</i></font>

247
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What was the deal with 
the proxy confession earlier?</font>

248
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I felt like I had to express my feelings.</i></font>

249
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I ran away from my radio show,</i></font>

250
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and I guess I'm just sick of hiding it.</i></font>

251
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">While you're at it,</font>

252
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">why not show yourself?</font>

253
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I wish.</font>

254
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What if I said 
I was actually fine with that?</i></font>

255
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why I asked you 
to come here, anyway.</i></font>

256
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm good.</font>

257
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What?</i></font>

258
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've decided to find you myself.</font>

259
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you showed yourself now, 
I would be admitting defeat.</font>

260
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that goes against 
the Yamabuki family tenets.</font>

261
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I made a promise, remember?</font>

262
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll turn everyone in the club into pros.</font>

263
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll know who you are 
by then, like it or not.</font>

264
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're actually serious about that, huh?</i></font>

265
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't think that dream's 
going to come true.</i></font>

266
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What are you after, anyway?</i></font>

267
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Did you come here just to find me 
and make me a pro?</i></font>

268
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here for a personal reason. 
I don't want to talk about them.</font>

269
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said...</font>

270
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After hearing all your voices in person, 
I've found myself a new goal.</font>

271
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to get a voice-related job, too.</font>

272
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Except, I won't be a performer. 
I'll be a producer.</font>

273
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to release songs.</font>

274
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to produce anime.</font>

275
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to have concerts</font>

276
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and create broadcast programming.</font>

277
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to work with you.</font>

278
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like it or not, 
I'll make that dream come true.</font>

279
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you're coming with me.</font>

280
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're so self-centered.</i></font>

281
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm coming with you, huh?</i></font>

282
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Close your eyes.</i></font>

283
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey, did you just walk out the room?</font>

284
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you be any more daring?</font>

285
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That voice was...</i></font>

286
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Errand boy?</font>

287
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How long are you gonna space out for?</font>

288
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My bad. I was thinking about something...</font>

289
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What on Earth?!</font>

290
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you think you can move a block now, 
I'd love to see you try!</font>

291
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd it end up like this?</font>

292
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We did our best.</font>

293
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got on our nerves.</font>

294
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The power of friendship.</font>

295
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you four teamed up 
to take down yours truly.</font>

296
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But is this even allowed?!</font>

297
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I say why not? It's fun.</font>

298
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yay.</font>

299
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember, Lemon-chan craves 
instant gratification above all else.</font>

300
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't say her response 
comes as a surprise,</font>

301
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I will say this isn't how 
a teacher is supposed to be!</font>

302
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, now, go ahead.</font>

303
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your turn.</font>

304
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though, one touch and...</font>

305
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's all o-ver for you!</font>

306
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know, it might crash on its own.</font>

307
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My strategy has been nullified.</i></font>

308
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In which case, I'll have to 
measure them with my eyes.</i></font>

309
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Victory is ours!</font>

310
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a good change of pace.</font>

311
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, look at the moon.</font>

312
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How pretty.</font>

313
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rawr!</font>

314
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, werewolf.</font>

315
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rawrity-rawr!</font>

316
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't you more of a cat?</font>

317
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so beautiful.</font>

318
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll wake people up.</font>

319
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Apollo, may I say one last thing?</font>

320
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was always a fan of yours, 
and I still am.</font>

321
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really glad I got 
to hear your voice again.</font>

322
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'll return the favor and tell you 
the same thing I said back then, too.</font>

323
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arisu...</font>

324
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you.</font>

325
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for calling my name.</font>

326
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I got to hear Apollo's voice 
in person for the first time,</i></font>

327
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I still couldn't identify 
which of these four was her.</i></font>

328
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you tired?</font>

329
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Today was a bit much, even for you, huh?</font>

330
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no time to breathe all day. 
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fatigued.</font>

331
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said...</font>

332
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You all must be just as tired.</font>

333
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We provided commentary 
for all the events,</font>

334
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}TEAM RED - TEAM WHITE</font>

335
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,720

336
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The broadcast club has cleared 
every mission we had for sports day.</font>

337
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should be proud of it.</font>

338
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit acting all smug, errand boy. 
Don't take charge.</font>

339
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But yeah...</font>

340
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We really did pull it off.</font>

341
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The proxy confessions went over well, too.</font>

342
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It wasn't easy,</font>

343
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we had fun, huh?</font>

344
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You had fun?</font>

345
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course we did.</font>

346
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was cool.</font>

347
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to do more of these.</font>

348
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you all had fun,</font>

349
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then yeah, it was a huge success!</font>

350
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad I went for it.</font>
