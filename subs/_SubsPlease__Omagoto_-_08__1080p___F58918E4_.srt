1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's warm.</font>

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has a gentle aroma, 
with a hint of sweetness.</font>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yum! What is this? 
I've never tasted anything like it!</font>

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To the right of your mug is your plate. 
There are fried eggs on it.</font>

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's warm. I've had these before.</font>

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next to the eggs are 
some toasted sandwiches.</font>

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's coarse... I've had these before too.</font>

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And further right is a bowl of salad.</font>

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Veggies? I know how this leaf tastes.</font>

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you get all that? Are you good?</font>

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I get where everything is now. Thanks.</font>

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hope you like the taste.</font>

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crispy. I like it.</font>

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, eggs! Creamy and yummy.</font>

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like the sour sauce on the leaves.</font>

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm impressed.</font>

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was born like this, so I'm used to it.</font>

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you should chew some more.</font>

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right.</font>

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need to hurry. 
Nobody's gonna take my food.</font>

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've had these before, 
but never in this flavor.</font>

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all so good.</font>

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was amazing.</font>

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You said you had amnesia, 
but you know what your name is, right?</font>

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do...</font>

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I wanna know your names first.</font>

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. I'll start, then.</font>

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Flum. Nice to meet you.</font>

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flum.</font>

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flum, who saved me.</font>

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do me now.</font>

33
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where?</font>

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Eterna, Flum's friend.</font>

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eterna, Flum's friend.</font>

36
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Milkit.</font>

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Master's slave.</font>

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Slave?</font>

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's naughty.</font>

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, no, I swear it's not like that!</font>

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She didn't purchase me.</font>

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She took me in when I had nowhere to go.</font>

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's letting me stay here too.</font>

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh...</font>

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You live together even though 
you're not family?</font>

46
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Must be nice.</font>

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can stay here for a while, too.</font>

48
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Can I really?</font>

49
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

50
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But only once you've given us your name.</font>

51
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Ink Wreathcraft.</font>

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Call me Ink!</font>

55
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

56
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lost child?</font>

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. She says she has amnesia and 
doesn't know where she came from.</font>

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it means I can keep eating all this 
yummy food, I wanna live here forever.</font>

59
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flum did say you could stay,</font>

60
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if you never go home, 
your parents are going to worry.</font>

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have any.</font>

62
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you living with relatives, then?</font>

63
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm, I dunno.</font>

64
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An orphanage, then?</font>

65
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dunno. I don't remember.</font>

66
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds mighty fishy to me.</font>

67
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she doesn't wanna say, 
she prob'ly ran away from home.</font>

68
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, don't jump to conclusions yet.</font>

69
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's clear she doesn't 
wanna go home, right?</font>

70
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has there been any news about a girl 
going missing from an orphanage?</font>

71
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not from any Church orphanage, at least.</font>

72
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Ed?</font>

73
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right.</font>

74
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's been no word from the West 
District one or any of the others.</font>

75
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

76
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, do you want us to take 
that girl in to our orphanage?</font>

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good idea. It'd make her easier 
to find for anyone lookin'.</font>

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you say, Flum?</font>

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,420

84
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,660

and I'm worried about her.</font>

85
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll ask around some more.</font>

86
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,580

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll ask around when I get back

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. It wasn't on purpose.</font>

312
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I know you meant that!</font>
