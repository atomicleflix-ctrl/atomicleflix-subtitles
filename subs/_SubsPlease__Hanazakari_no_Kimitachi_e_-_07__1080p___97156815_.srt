43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,450

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look like a mother cat 
diligently grooming her kitten.</font>

47
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I totally see it.</font>

48
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who the hell are you

49
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm done eating.</font>

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going back to my room.</font>

51
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess I'll also go on and—</font>

52
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stay and eat your food.</font>

53
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Total mother cat vibes.</font>

54
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sano's changed since 
you showed up, Ashiya.</font>

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

56
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It's like he's gotten 
more cheerful or something.</font>

57
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's definitely less guarded 
about his emotions.</font>

58
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was different before?</font>

59
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like he was ever 
hard to get along with.</font>

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He just always kept us 
at arm's length, I guess?</font>

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like he kept himself closed off.</font>

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, exactly.</font>

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really had him and Nakatsu 
butting heads at first.</font>

64
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say that was more Nakatsu 
refusing to let it go.</font>

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right, Nakatsu?</font>

66
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Y-Yeah.</font>

67
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, I feel like Sano's 
vibe and aura aren't so bad now.</font>

68
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His aura?!</font>

69
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>C'mon, there's nothing to overthink here.</i></font>

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Man up, Shuichi!</i></font>

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is nothing weird between bros.</i></font>

72
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You're just inviting him to your place
if he's got nowhere to go.</i></font>

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right.</i></font>

74
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm inviting him to come 
hang out together, eat together,</i></font>

75
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>bathe together...</i></font>

76
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that!</font>

77
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut it.</font>

78
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can we help you?</font>

79
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"We"?</font>

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you sure can.</font>

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome back.</font>

82
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nakatsu?</font>

83
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's up?</font>

84
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki, if you don't have anywhere to go,</font>

85
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wanna stay at my place?</font>

86
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's in Osaka, but it's 
still closer than the States.</font>

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our house has plenty of spare rooms.</font>

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,880

89
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

90
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I-I couldn't.</i></font>

91
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>On the off chance I get found out...</i></font>

92
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, I can't put you out like that.</font>

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too much.</font>

94
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

95
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No problem then.</font>

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't even worry about it.</font>

97
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just figured I'd offer.</font>

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See ya!</font>

99
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Nakatsu.</font>

100
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure about that?</font>

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have a place to stay, right?</font>

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I guess.</font>

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case...</font>

104
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Want to come to my house?</font>

105
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'd have to share a room, 
but we've been doing that all along,</font>

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,060

00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

108
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, let me give it some thought.</font>

 a little more wary than this?</i></font>

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,680

165
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,030

166
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By any chance, are you...</font>

168
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

169
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Nanba-senpai is 
your older sister's son?</font>

170
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which makes me their nephew.</font>

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that right, Auntie Rio?</font>

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hardly matters when
 I'm younger than you!</font>

173
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, so <i>that's</i> the story here.</font>

174
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uncle, my mom was pestering me about 
the Hayama Boarding House thing.</font>

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I'm going there!</font>

176
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a pain in the ass.</font>

177
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She figured this would happen,</font>

178
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so she's driving here to pick you up.</font>

179
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In ten minutes.</font>

180
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'm getting out of here
 on the double!</font>

181
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give my regards to the demon witch!</font>

185
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because I'm a demon witch.</font>

186
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't age.</font>

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-That's your older sister?</font>

189
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where were you trying 
to sneak off to, Hokuto?</font>

190
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nowhere. Just a little walk.</font>

191
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me the truth or else...</font>

192
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going on a vacation to a 
southern island with a friend.</font>

193
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're so heartless, Hokuto!</font>

194
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been asking you to keep this 
summer open for over a year!</font>

195
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How cruel you are when we're 
so direly understaffed!</font>

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can hardly believe 
we're related right now!</font>

197
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You dirty hag...</i></font>

198
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing to worry about, Ms. Magistrate.</font>

199
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've got a pretty face just itching
 to work for you right here.</font>

200
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

201
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You weren't kidding.</font>

202
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like she likes him.</font>

203
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

204
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking at him reminds me of when
 I used to play dress-up with you.</font>

205
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know, Hokuto?</font>

206
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The bastard snuck away!</font>

207
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hayama Boarding House?</font>

208
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

209
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The gig comes with room 
and board, so it all works out.</font>

210
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, that actually sounds perfect.</font>

211
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll sign on too.</font>

212
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

213
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was going to look for 
a part-time job anyway.</font>

214
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'll do it too, Mizuki!</font>

215
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Count me in.</font>

216
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's gotten into you two?</font>

217
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, she did say they 
were understaffed,</font>

218
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I guess it would be okay.</font>

219
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So long as I breathe, I'm </i>not<i> 
letting you two be alone!</i></font>

220
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ashiya-kun!</font>

221
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:05,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ma'am!</font>

222
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you serve this?</font>

223
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

224
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Having you here has been such a help.</font>

225
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're so shorthanded this year.</font>

226
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only people I've been able to hire 
are two local college students.</font>

227
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was in a real bind.</font>

228
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The other two workers you 
introduced me to are great too.</font>

229
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to thank you.</font>

230
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were also in a tough situation because
we got kicked out of our dorm.</font>

231
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you, it's true.</font>

232
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on!</font>

233
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Makita-kun.</font>

234
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Coming!</font>

235
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See you later.</font>

236
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your romantic life is your own business,</font>

237
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if you touch a customer, you're fired.</font>

238
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talk about harsh.</font>

239
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I know that.</font>

240
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've only been here
two days, Mizuki-kun,</font>

241
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you're learning fast.</font>

242
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just a really good teacher.</font>

243
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mealtimes sure are busy.</font>

244
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not like that.</font>

245
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You fold it here.</font>

246
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like this?</font>

247
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got it. That's great.</font>

248
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

249
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The last step is folding it right there.</font>

250
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did it!</font>

251
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, very good. You pass.</font>

252
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great!</font>

253
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's how it's done.</font>

254
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ashiya, stop taking it easy 
and come help out here.</font>

255
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sorry.</font>

256
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be right there.</font>

257
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Sano. Check this out.</font>

258
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks good, right?</font>

259
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, yeah.</font>

260
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's great.</font>

261
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh yeah.</font>

262
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to go feed Yujiro.</font>

263
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll come with.</font>

264
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love dogs.</font>

265
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, really?</font>

266
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell?</font>

267
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That guy is all over Mizuki!</font>

268
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's just babying him a 
little since he's so cute.</font>

269
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Ashiya-kun's a boy, so he'll be fine.</font>

270
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go keep an eye on them!</font>

271
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He does good work, but you know...</font>

272
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mayumi-chan, you be careful too.</font>

273
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

274
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So Io-san said to bring 
the dog along as well?</font>

275
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

276
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When we told her there would be
nobody left to take care of him,</font>

277
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she told us just to bring him too.</font>

278
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, so, can I ask you something?</font>

279
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

280
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which of those two guys is your boyfriend?</font>

281
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? N-Neither one.</font>

282
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I'm a he—</font>

283
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's cute.</font>

284
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You go by male pronouns?</font>

285
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I'll call you Mizuki-kun too.</font>

286
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you don't understand.</font>

287
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

288
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I get it.</font>

289
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The boss tried to warn me about this.</font>

290
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess she doesn't trust me.</font>

291
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

292
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki, what are you doing?</font>

293
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'm a guy!</font>

294
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's so cute.</font>

295
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I'm a guy," huh?</font>

296
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love that naivety.</font>

297
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nakatsu, what are you angry about?</font>

298
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothin'!</font>

299
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm all sweaty, so I'm going to go change.</font>

300
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure.</font>

301
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

302
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time to peel potatoes.</font>

303
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm seriously soaked in sweat.</font>

304
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn, this is so tight...</font>

305
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank God I could close it.</font>

306
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have I gained weight?</font>

307
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because Io-san's cooking
 is too delicious!</font>

308
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, man, doesn't that Makita 
dude piss you off?</font>

309
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's such a creep around Mizuki.</font>

310
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm kind of worried about him now.</font>

311
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's none of your business.</font>

312
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

313
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, yeah, I get it.</font>

314
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not part of the inner circle.</font>

315
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though I got a room
 here, it's a single.</font>

316
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All while you two get to share!</font>

317
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so lonely!</font>

318
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so alone!</font>

319
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Nakatsu?</font>

320
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, fine, I'm sorry.</font>

321
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come back!</font>

322
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I had no idea he was so 
lonely staying by himself.</i></font>

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nice you all are such close friends.</font>

324
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

325
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ashiya?</font>

326
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah?</font>

327
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You aren't... in trouble?</font>

328
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What do you mean?</font>

329
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If not, forget I said anything.</font>

330
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

331
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That was weird.</i></font>

332
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So today, we've got Ota, party of two.</font>

333
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then...</font>

334
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

335
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki, how many guests we got today?</font>

336
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Io-san told me to go make the beds.</font>

337
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki?</font>

338
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be Kagurazaka-sama.</font>

339
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Welcome.</font>

340
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So I just had to make </i>this guy's<i> bed?</i></font>

341
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell are you guys doing here?</font>

342
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The food's gonna taste awful
 with you around.</font>

343
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dumbass!</font>

344
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look who's talking!</font>

345
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot!</font>

346
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you speak to our esteemed 
guests in that manner, you lout?!</font>

347
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sorry.</font>

348
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for the rudeness 
of my employees.</font>

349
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But please rest assured.</font>

350
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I prepare all the meals here myself.</font>

351
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have my word they'll be good.</font>

352
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Kagurazaka-sama, I believe your 
reservation was for four people.</font>

353
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our family's temple had 
a sudden change of schedule.</font>

354
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, your family operates a temple?</font>

355
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I'm here in place of my parents.</font>

356
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>H-His parents run a temple?!</i></font>

357
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Onii-chan.</font>

358
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh my God, it's Sano Izumi!</font>

359
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?! No way! He's real!</font>

360
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here?!</font>

361
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is such a coincidence! I can't even!</font>

362
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My brother told me you'd made 
a comeback, Izumi-sama!</font>

363
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I never dreamed I'd run into you here!</font>

364
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Izumi-sama"?</font>

365
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Tamami.</font>

366
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been such a fan ever since 
my first year of middle school.</font>

367
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Come on, Tamami.</font>

368
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanted to hit the beach.</font>

369
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is so embarrassing.</font>

370
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Izumi-sama!</font>

371
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's talk more later!</font>

372
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And let's go swimming
 together in the ocean!</font>

373
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Ya know, I'm not surprised he's 
got a little sister like that.</font>

374
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The heck?!</font>

375
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nii-cha—</font>

376
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

377
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must've mixed you up with Kagurazaka.</font>

378
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn him.</font>

379
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who leaves their baby sister behind?</font>

380
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a big shock, huh?</font>

381
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your name, little lady?</font>

382
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyomi.</font>

383
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And how old are you, Kyomi-chan?</font>

384
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Three.</font>

385
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You brat!</font>

386
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa there, Sano,
 can you hold Nakatsu back?</font>

387
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemme go!</font>

388
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nakatsu, she's just a little kid.</font>

389
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay?</font>

390
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kyomi-chan, why don't we go to your room?</font>

391
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in.</font>

392
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kagurazaka, I brought Kyomi-chan...</font>

393
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so sorry!</font>

394
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine.</font>

395
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a swimsuit.</font>

396
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on in.</font>

397
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe I actually 
got to meet Izumi-sama!</font>

398
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad I forced my 
brother to bring me here.</font>

399
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our folks wouldn't let me come 
 with just friends</font>

400
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">since I'm only a second-year
 middle schooler.</font>

401
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

402
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She's only in the second year 
of middle school, and yet...</i></font>

403
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm jealous.</i></font>

404
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, wait, that would actually be 
a detriment for me right now.</i></font>

405
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

406
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuki-kun, I wanna ask you something.</font>

407
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nee-cha. The ocean.</font>

408
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, what?</font>
