1
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There you are.</font>

2
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wolfwood, thanks for your 
help back there.</font>

3
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough already. How many
 times are you going to thank me?</font>

4
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides...</font>

5
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean thanks <i>again</i> 
for my help <i>as always</i>.</font>

6
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. 
What would I do without you?</font>

7
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's Emilio?</font>

8
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still unconscious, but not in any
 mortal danger, I'm told.</font>

9
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

10
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guy tried to kill you, 
yet you're relieved to hear he's okay.</font>

11
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad to see you haven't changed 
in the past two and a half years.</font>

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm also glad to see you.</font>

13
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm being sarcastic.</font>

14
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know.</font>

15
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, Wolfwood...</font>

16
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

17
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were looking for me, right?</font>

18
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, that's right.</font>

19
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got something to give you.</font>

20
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dropped this.</font>

21
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've held on to it 
all this time? Thank you.</font>

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enough with the thanks. Listen.</font>

23
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next time, use that gun 
to kill without hesitation.</font>

24
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean that monster.</font>

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do realize, don't you?</font>

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You caused that disaster 
by being too soft.</font>

27
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Nai is alive, I'll stop him 
for sure this time.</font>

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I won't kill anyone.</font>

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's what I mean by "soft."</font>

30
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone has to bring the fangs. 
Otherwise, someone else pays in tears.</font>

31
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse us!</font>

32
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon the interruption.</font>

33
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, no. We're in the
 middle of something.</font>

34
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stay out of it, girls.</font>

35
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, don't worry! It's fine.</font>

36
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't mind us.</font>

37
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you to— Hey!</font>

38
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, first question.</font>

39
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da!</font>

40
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">F-First?</font>

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell us exactly what you've been up to
 for the past two and a half years.</font>

42
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

43
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, another question, then.</font>

45
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da-da!</font>

46
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your favorite food?</font>

47
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

48
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kinda question's that?</font>

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first any reporter would ask.</font>

50
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girls, enough is—</font>

51
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Now give us your reaction 
to this dramatic reunion!</font>

52
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ta-da-da-da!</font>

53
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, um, I personally never 
doubted for a second that—</font>

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why're you making me talk like that?!</font>

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right! Vash, Undertaker!
 Smile for the camera! Say cheese!</font>

56
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever. Do what you want.</font>

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well then, let us return 
to the first question.</font>

58
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So far, deviation from the simulations</font>

59
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is within two percent, give or take.</font>

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose everything 
is coming along great.</font>

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To graft Knives with plants 
in order to resurrect him...</font>

62
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When everything works out as planned,</font>

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he may well kill us all out of rage 
for sacrificing plants like this.</font>

64
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I get to see the world Lord Knives 
creates with my own eyes,</font>

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't ask for anything more.</font>

66
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doctor, begin.</font>

67
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

68
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry about this.</font>

69
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Initiating grafting.</font>

70
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what Lord Knives dreams of.</font>

71
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows?</font>

72
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a being from a higher
 dimension, right?</font>

73
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way we could understand.</font>

74
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Today is the twins' first birthday!</i></font>

75
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Today is Tesla's first birthday!</i></font>

76
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's already been a year, huh?
It really went by in a flash.</i></font>

77
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you watching that again?</font>

78
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes you a "doting parent," right?</font>

79
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed. Didn't you know?</font>

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you, the cutest in the universe,</font>

81
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">which makes me the most 
doting parent in the universe!</font>

82
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should we have another 
birthday party next year, too?</font>

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course! We will for sure.</font>

84
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Help me!</font>

85
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The seventh grafting was a success.</font>

86
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you waiting for?</font>

87
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To bring Lord Knives back, 
we need lots more plants!</font>

88
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have to remind me.</font>

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Midvalley.</font>

90
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I take a guess about what's 
going through your mind right now?</font>

91
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Give it a shot.</font>

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Perhaps I should kill him now, 
while I have the opportunity."</font>

93
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? How'd I do?</font>

94
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have felt it yourself 
after Lost JuLai.</font>

95
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His powers are much 
too strong, far too great.</font>

96
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, yup!</font>

97
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps next time, 
the catastrophe will be even greater.</font>

98
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, you oppose Lord Knives
 creating a world for his brethren?</font>

99
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know.</font>

100
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, why don't you give it a try?</font>

101
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now, Lord Knives is powerless.</font>

102
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This could be your last chance.</font>

103
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't resist Lord Knives, 
even when he's in this state!</font>

104
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Midvalley.</font>

105
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up.</font>

106
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-Please! Let us go!</font>

107
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kids! I'm having kids soon!</font>

108
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I'll make sure you 
see your children in the afterlife.</font>

109
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please! I've worked so hard! Come on!</font>

110
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We weren't going to put our lives 
on the line to protect the plants anyway!</font>

111
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, help is on the way, right? 
That colony fleet?</font>

112
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please—</font>

113
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humans are incredible, don't you think?</font>

114
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When they put all their muscles to use,
even ones they don't usually,</font>

115
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">anything is possible!</font>

116
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Naturally, they still have
 the ability to feel pain.</font>

117
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even as your hands 
are crushed out of shape,</font>

118
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you can't stop yourself!</font>

119
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Murder maniac.</font>

120
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, the hell I want you
 to experience is even more exquisite.</font>

121
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that exciting, Vash the Stampede?</font>

122
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, come. Let us retrieve the plant.</font>

123
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're all birds of a feather, after all.</i></font>

124

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash is right here. 
He can't be the one who did it!</font>

136
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}Authorities are on high alert.</i></font>

137
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brad, please bring me the plates.</font>

138
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got it.</font>

139
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All done!</font>

140
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Let me do it!</font>

141
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're growing steadily, for now.</font>

142
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flora, huh? Mm, that's kind of soothing!</font>

143
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't say I like the smell. 
It's like... gooey or raw or something.</font>

144
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that what's nice about it?</font>

145
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

146
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, look! There's water 
coming out of the tip!</font>

147
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flora can store up water inside.</font>

148
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's not all. Some are even edible.</font>

149
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, that's impressive!</font>

150
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only just learned myself, honestly.</font>

151
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash! Sorry to keep you waiting!</font>

152
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way! Is that omelet rice?</font>

153
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks delicious!</font>

154
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This one's special! Here, Vash—</font>

155
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for the grub, little lady.</font>

156
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, that's—</font>

157
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mm, pretty good.</font>

158
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jessica?</font>

159
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nothing.</font>

160
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's eat!</font>

161
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's eat.</font>

162
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Delicious!</font>

163
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't had omelet rice in years.</font>

164
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look at all this egg! How extravagant.</font>

165
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much, Brad!</font>

166
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jessica's the one who made it.</font>

167
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Jessica!</font>

168
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're welcome!</font>

169
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This really is tasty, Jessica.</font>

170
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bet you had no idea, huh?</font>

171
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you've really grown up.</font>

172
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's lots more you don't know, too!</font>

173
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, there's so much I don't know.</font>

174
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Talk about obvious.</font>

175
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The world is full of shit you don't know.</font>

176
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Trying to learn it all is impossible.</font>

177
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True.</font>

178
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Undertaker is right.</font>

179
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the desire to learn
 is what's important.</font>

180
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

181
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Appreciate it.</font>

182
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're welcome.</font>

183
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll teach you even more about me!</font>

184
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure, in time.</font>

185
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, I guess having lots of plants 
means you get</font>

186
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to eat nice food like 
omelet rice all the time.</font>

187
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hardly.</font>

188
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was special, just to welcome you.</font>

189
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That right? Sorry, that was rude of me.</font>

190
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

191
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't apologized to you yet.</font>

192
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We knew Vash was alive after Lost JuLai.</font>

193
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when you asked me, 
I lied and said I didn't.</font>

194
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

195
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luida, it's all right. You just—</font>

196
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wanted to leave Vash in peace.</font>

197
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In a parental kind of way, right?</font>

198
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I completely understand.</font>

199
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You got nothing to worry about.</font>

200
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that delicious omelet rice, 
we're totally square.</font>

201
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But man, that omelet rice...</font>

202
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love for them to try it someday.</font>

203
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Them"?</font>

204
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean the kids at the orphanage 
where you said you used to live?</font>

205
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When help arrives with the colony fleet, 
I wonder if they'll get a chance.</font>

206
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About that, Vash...</font>

207
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure Emilio was 
being manipulated by Knives?</font>

208
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think so.</font>

209
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assuming the colony fleet 
arrives in six months,</font>

210
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt Knives will just sit by and watch.</font>

211
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Agreed.</font>

212
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There must be plants 
aboard the colony fleet as well.</font>

213
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It only makes sense he'd
 try to take advantage of that.</font>

214
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a predicament.</font>

215
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the food!</font>

216
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, thank you.</font>

217
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Jessica.</font>

218
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure!</font>

219
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know! We'll clean up.
 Won't we, Undertaker?</font>

220
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

221
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I guess I owe 'em for a nice meal.</font>

222
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a great dishwasher, you know.</font>

223
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was delicious!</font>

224
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Glad you liked it!</font>

225
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you use a secret ingredient?</font>

226
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One thing is for certain.</font>

227
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must stop Knives, no matter what.</font>

228
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah...</font>

229
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

230
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like you said, even if it's difficult,</font>

231
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we have to strive to walk the right path.</font>

232
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

233
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, we should work 
on what we can do right now.</font>

234
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So come with me, Vash.</font>

235
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do what I can for you.</font>

236
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many more do we need 
to get Lord Knives back completely?</font>

237
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, according to my calculations, 
for a full recovery, we'd...</font>

238
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hey.</font>

239
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are lots of plants on Ship 3, right?</font>

240
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

241
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then why don't we take all of them?</font>

242
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll save us a lot of time.</font>

243
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm, interesting.</font>

244
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, wait!</font>

245
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Home... Ship 3 has defenses.</font>

246
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a chance they'd defeat us instead!</font>

247
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is what it is.</font>

248
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... No, I can't support 
going after Home.</font>

249
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Midvalley.</font>

250
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Vash the Stampede is on Ship 3 right now.</font>

251
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A tip from the self-centered puppeteer.</font>

252
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before we launch our attack, 
you go in and capture him.</font>

253
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Capture? Not kill?</font>

254
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rules of the game have changed.</font>

255
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to awaken Knives, we need Vash.</font>

256
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah.</font>

257
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, just killing him 
wouldn't be any fun.</font>

258
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to make sure 
Vash the Stampede is dealt</font>

259
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the ultimate suffering by human hands.</font>

260
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He will learn the true nature of humans,</font>

261
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">despite desperately trying to save them!</font>

262
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must bring Vash the Stampede 
to Lord Knives.</font>

263
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will be taking
 all the plants on Ship 3.</font>

264
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood?</font>

265
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can run if you want.</font>

266
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Run?</i></font>

267
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Where in this world is there to run?</i></font>

268
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry to cause you so much trouble, Brad.</font>

269
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many times are you going 
to break my masterpiece?</font>

270
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spare parts on this ship are limited.</font>

271
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no telling how
many more times I can do this.</font>

272
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'll be gentler with it from now on!</font>

273
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sure hope so.</font>

274
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I already fixed up your gun.</font>

275
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, I got you a new coat 
and a pair of sunglasses.</font>

276
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Brad!</font>

277
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't have you wearing
 those rags anymore.</font>

278
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I helped sew up the coat, too!</font>

279
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Jessica. 
I'll be careful with it.</font>

280
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I sure hope so!</font>

281
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now all that's left is to stitch this on!</font>

282
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? H-Hey, wait...</font>

283
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Where should it go? 
It's gotta be smack on the front, right?</font>

284
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">J-J-Jessica!</font>

285
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't move.</font>

286
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sorry!</font>

287
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I know, Jessica! Before that, 
I need your help with something!</font>

288
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

289
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really want it cut?</font>

290
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, real short.</font>

291
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look cool with long hair, though.</font>

292
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about a mohawk for a change of pace?</font>

293
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I don't need <i>that</i> much of a change.</font>

294
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't it be funny to get a ducktail?</font>

295
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Funny?!</font>

296
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't move.</font>

297
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sorry.</font>

298
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not just shave it all off?</font>

299
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That sounds good!</font>

300
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It does?!</font>

301
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, maybe not shaved, but...</font>

302
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just want it like it was before?</font>

303
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. I've already decided what 
kind of style to go for.</font>

304
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Done!</font>

305
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? What do you think?</font>

306
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's great, Jessica.</font>

307
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks great on you.</font>

308
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Awesome!</font>

309
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shaved would've been better.</font>

310
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But why this hairstyle?</font>

311
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's...</font>

312
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to show my determination, I guess.</font>

313
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right, time to finish up the coat!</font>

314
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really going to put that on?</font>

315
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course!</font>

316
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My head!</font>

317
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's... Hornfreak!</font>

318
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hornfreak?</font>

319
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Midvalley the Hornfreak.</font>

320
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One of Knives's goons.</font>

321
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Not yet!</font>

322
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, Brad—</font>

323
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you going to fight with just one arm?</font>

324
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you to stay put!</font>

325
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

326
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm almost done!</font>

327
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Undertaker?</font>

328
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wolfwood!</font>

329
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go.</font>

330
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You owe me one, Needle-noggin.</font>

331
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The time to awaken is nigh.</font>
