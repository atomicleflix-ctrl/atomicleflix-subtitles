00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo, wait!</font>

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's dangerous!</font>

3
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font color="#ebeedb"><font face="Times New Roman">To-ou Medical University Hospital</font></font></font>

4
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We haven't seen each other 
in three years...</font>

5
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this is how we reunite?</font>

6
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This may sting a little.</font>

7
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That looks hella painful!</font>

8
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No fractures.</font>

9
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing abnormal in their 
brain CT scans as well.</font>

10
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's abnormal.</font>

11
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Starting a fight on a pedestrian bridge?</font>

12
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Falling down the stairs?</font>

13
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you two stupid?</font>

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki!</font>

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure nothing's broken?</font>

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really okay?</font>

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you. It's no big deal.</font>

18
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Such a drama queen.</font>

19
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shut up!</font>

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd react the same way if you 
got a call from Mizuho saying:</font>

21
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"They're going to die! Help us!"</font>

22
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My soul left my body!</font>

23
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I saw Kizuki 
for the first time in forever!</font>

24
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two grown adults all banged up</font>

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font color="#ffffff">grabbing and thrashing 
at each other on the ground!</font></font>

26
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I'd think 
something's messed up!</font>

27
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was going to go home 
once I blew off some steam.</font>

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you take my car and drive us 
to the hospital without my permission?</font>

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like I'd let you <i>go home</i> after that!</font>

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You stubborn four-eyes!</font>

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh my god, you're so loud.</font>

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You two also caused trouble 
for Mizuho, too.</font>

33
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kashiwagi.</font>

34
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your childhood friends are a riot.</font>

36
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm leaving the rest to you.</font>

37
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

38
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why were you even in Omotesando, Syugo?</font>

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I check out restaurants 
I'm interested in on my days off.</font>

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Diligent about your work research, I see.</font>

41
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was my fault.</font>

42
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo has a right to be angry.</font>

43
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I'm useless to Mizuho if I can't swim."</font>

44
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I drowned in those thoughts and I...</font>

45
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuho's not like that.</font>

46
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. You're right.</font>

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure she'd accept any version of me.</font>

48
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I...</font>

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The past me didn't realize that.</font>

50
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Childhood friends are so nice.</font>

51
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like some coffee? 
I'll have one, too.</font>

52
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've known Kashiwagi since 
you were little, right, Nishino-san?</font>

53
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. I've heard from Shin that</font>

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you've been friends with him 
since college, Kuroda-sensei.</font>

55
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

56
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, well..</font>

57
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not really true.</font>

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was only sticking around 
Kashiwagi by my own will.</font>

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it wasn't like that.</font>

60
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shin has it really good.</font>

62
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should have just been friends 
with Kizuki, too.</font>

63
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

64
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going home.</font>

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

66
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go with you.</font>

67
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me catch a ride.</font>

68
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too far for you.</font>

69
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need a buddy to keep an eye on me.</font>

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll spend the night at my dad's.</font>

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm worried about you, Syugo.</font>

72
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do what you want.</font>

73
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait for me!</font>

74
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Shin.</font>

75
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

76
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll be chewing you out 
the next time I see you.</font>

77
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been a while since we've heard 
Shin-chan's lectures from the heart!</font>

78
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kizuki.</font>

79
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what you want to do.</font>

80
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'm <i>never</i> letting you 
have Mizuho ever again.</font>

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font color="#e3dbcc"><font face="Times New Roman">To-ou Medical University Hospital</font></font></font>

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kashiwagi?</font>

83
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nishino-san...</font>

84
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">left with the guy wearing glasses.</font>

85
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

86
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for before, Kuroda.</font>

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were a big help.</font>

88
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, yeah.</font>

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll treat you to something next time.</font>

90
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. I want a super expensive meal.</font>

91
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always ask for that.</font>

92
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Kashiwagi makes me smile.</i></font>

93
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But also hurts me a bit.</i></font>

94
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2022</font></font>

95
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's see...</font>

96
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Building C...</font>

97
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Room 3002?</font>

98
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is that?</font>

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Excuse me.</font>

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Building C is over there.</font>

101
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're in anatomy, 
that's where I'm headed.</font>

102
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we could go there together...</font>

103
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. That would be great.</font>

104
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much.</font>

105
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's nothing!</font>

106
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way, then.</font>

107
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You okay, Kashiwagi?</font>

108
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just super sleepy.</font>

109
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

110
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who would have known the welcome party 
was all night karaoke?</font>

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if college 
is like this all the time.</font>

112
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. Can I ask you something?</font>

113
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

114
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What inspired you to become a doctor?</font>

115
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. My family 
owns a hospital in Fukuoka.</font>

116
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been passed down 
for three generations,</font>

117
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I have to take over 
the family business.</font>

118
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something basic like that.</font>

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's really impressive.</font>

120
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah...</font>

121
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm telling you this 
because it's you, Kuroda.</font>

122
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Back in elementary school,</font>

123
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the mom of a childhood friend of mine
passed away from an illness.</font>

124
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My friend, who used to 
always smile without a care in the world,</font>

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">made the saddest expression 
I've ever seen.</font>

126
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I couldn't forget that face.</font>

127
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to be a doctor 
who could cure any illness...</font>

128
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I can ensure my friend will 
never feel that kind of sadness again.</font>

129
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I took those feelings seriously.</font>

130
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said...</font>

131
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My resolve sounds more basic.</font>

132
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's kind of a selfish reason 
for me, right?</font>

133
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That will be all for today.</font>

134
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be sure to submit your report 
before the next class.</font>

135
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kashiwagi.</font>

136
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hm?</font>

137
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you pull an all-nighter again?</font>

173
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes caring so much about someone

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who do you take me for?!</font>

178
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't underestimate medical science!</font>

186
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah. Sure.</font>

187
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400

189
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

190
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,660

192
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,960

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you want to eat, Kuroda?</font>

197
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something expensive!</font>

198
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,030

that you're not doing well?</font>

275
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you going to do with those?</font>

276
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, well...</font>

277
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm thinking of giving up on making manga.</font>

278
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You serious?</font>

279
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

280
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone else is busy 
 job searching...</font>

281
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I haven't even debuted.</font>

282
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried to do my best like Kizuki.</font>

283
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's giving it his all to represent Japan.</font>

284
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it feels like I'm 
still clinging to a dream</font>

285
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that will never come true.</font>

286
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I must look so childish to you, Syugo.</font>

287
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's what you've 
been wanting to do, right?</font>

288
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now...</font>

289
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what I write, 
it doesn't feel right.</font>

290
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know if this is what 
I really want to do anymore.</font>

291
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't draw anything.</font>

292
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which is why...</font>

293
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to start job searching!</font>

294
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're forcing that smile.</font>

295
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

296
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. For your new resolve!</font>

297
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

298
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's nice.</font>

299
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that's what you decided on,</font>

300
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">go on and do that!</font>

301
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

302
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font size="30">2028</font></font>

303
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did he leave me?</font>

304
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm borrowing your kitchen.</font>

305
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat whatever you'd like.</font>

306
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And take a break from work, too.</font>

307
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't even think about Kizuki today.</font>

308
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, you have to eat something, Mizuho.</font>

309
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please. Just one bite.</font>

310
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo...</font>

311
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so good.</font>

312
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mizuho...</font>

313
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you, Syugo.</font>

314
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For always cheering me up.</font>

315
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop grinning at me 
like that while eating.</font>

316
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't help it. It's good.</font>

317
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

318
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing.</font>

319
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You always make a scary face, Syugo.</font>

320
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was so shocked 
when you jumped at Kizuki.</font>

321
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't seen you make 
a face like that before.</font>

322
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a chef, what would you do 
if you hurt your hand?</font>

323
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you out of your mind?</font>

324
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and Kizuki!</font>

325
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Throwing hands at each other like that—</font>

326
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No more talking about Kizuki.</font>

327
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

328
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right now...</font>

329
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The person in front of you...</font>

330
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is me.</font>

331
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Out of anyone else, 
the one by your side...</font>

332
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is me.</font>

333
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Syugo?</font>

334
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?</i></font>

335
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time to go.</font>

336
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll drop you off.</font>

337
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to chaperon me.</font>

338
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The name of this song is...</i></font>

339
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"My Regretful Heart."</i></font>
