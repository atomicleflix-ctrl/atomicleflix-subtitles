73
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,480

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, it totally is.</font>

77

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

85
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one could hear a cry 
for help from here, right?</font>

86
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. There's no escape from here.</font>

87
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

88
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one can hear, huh?</font>

89
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. Once this is over,</font>

90
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'll be offered up 
alongside your companions.</font>

91
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey...</font>

92
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why...</font>

93
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you have that thing?!</font>

94
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enjin said I can't kill people anymore.</font>

95
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I was trying really hard 
to fight without killing you.</font>

96
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're just too strong, 
so I ended up having to use it.</font>

97
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thankfully, it seems like nobody can hear it.</font>

98
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to finish things here 
so I can get going.</font>

99
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to protect my team from the enemy.</font>

100
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. Those scissors 
are my only vital instrument.</font>

101
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never stain them with blood again.</font>

102
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a promise I made a long time ago.</font>

103
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is an ordinary gun I got 
from my boss at my last job.</font>

104
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A parting gift.</font>

105
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me, you're...</font>

106
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a professional killer?!</font>

107
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's going to have to 
be our little secret, okay?</font>

108
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lucky for you, Enjin's got me on a leash now.</font>

109
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That means you get to live.</font>

110
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't move now, 
but I made sure it was a flesh wound.</font>

111
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make sure that manhole kid saves you.</font>

112
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna go look for the rest of my team now.</font>

113
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know where they are?</font>

114
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I just assumed the Cleaners 
would like to keep their hands clean...</i></font>

115
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There's some real dirty bastards there.</i></font>

116
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only the manhole kid and the Raiders' boss 
know where they are, huh?</font>

117
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And she said these pipes link 
together like blood vessels...</font>

118
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't be easy to find them.</font>

119
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna know more about you.</font>

120
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,210

121
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,140

123
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,740

124
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't I go and ask her what's what?</font>

125
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,170

135
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guess we'd better get you out of here.</font>

136
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to get back and get you patched up.</font>

137
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jabber won.</font>

138
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Noerde lost.</font>

139
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fu's still waiting for the umbrella-wielder 
to make the first move.</font>

140
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bundus is talking to the "father-son" duo, 
trying to get info about the Cleaners' leader.</font>

141
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rudo.</font>

142
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You Cleaners are tougher than I expected.</font>

143
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that supposed to mean?!</font>

144
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing to them?</font>

145
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should get moving.</font>

146
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit... You...</font>

147
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quit tossing me around!</font>

148
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You still haven't told me where we are,</font>

149
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">why you're here, or what you want from me!</font>

150
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna pound you, asshole!</font>

151
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just can't do anything 
without cursing and flailing, can you?</font>

152
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made you an offer.</font>

153
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Want to take the Sphere down with me?"</font>

154
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not your mouth 
you should be working right now.</font>

155
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's your brain—considering whether to accept.</font>

156
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you the kind of person who can't 
do anything unless it's all laid out for you?</font>

157
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should I prepare a picture book?</font>

158
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I've got one thing worked out!</font>

159
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just the kind of asshole I hate!</font>

160
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish a more level-headed Sphereite 
had fallen down here instead.</font>

161
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I doubt you have anything to contribute 
regarding a plan to reach the Sphere.</font>

162
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Allow me to show you, then.</font>

163
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Watchman series—</font>

164
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your gloves.</font>

165
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My coat.</font>

166
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And these boots.</font>

167
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was trying to create my own entries 
in the Watchman series.</font>
