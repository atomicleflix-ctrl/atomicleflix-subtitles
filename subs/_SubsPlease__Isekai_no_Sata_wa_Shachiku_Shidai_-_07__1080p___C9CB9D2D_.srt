00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want me to make five

there are any problems.</font>

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, there you are, Sei-san! 
I've been looking for you.</font>

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,370

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's for you.</font>

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,510

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be able to do

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,890

92
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My family lived in a two-story home.</font>

93
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first floor had a living room,

94
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The second floor had three bedrooms.</font>

95
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,730

96
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We also had a yard just big enough

106
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wouldn't spreading the 
casting over three days</font>

107

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When did you sneak in?</font>

133
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're awake?</font>

134
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama, why do you sleep 
in my bed every night?</font>

135
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Got a problem?</font>

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I locked the door...</font>

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've objected many times to no avail.</i></font>

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I work too late into the night, 
he drags me to bed.</i></font>

139
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even though I already make sure 
to retire before midnight.</i></font>

140
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In truth, I'm aware of what's going on.</i></font>

141
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's using healing magic on my 
magicule-weakened body every night.</i></font>

142
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Minor healing spells 
can be cast via touch.</i></font>

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We've only gone all the way twice:</i></font>

144
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>when I took too many tonics
 and when I was assaulted.</i></font>

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Both were necessary "treatments," 
so there was no way around it.</i></font>

146
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't plan on letting anyone 
else take care of you. Got it?</i></font>

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sei-san!</font>

148
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sei-san!</font>

149
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is there something on your mind?</font>

150
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. More importantly, 
what about the documents?</font>

151
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All flawless!</font>

152
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks to this tool you gave me, 
calculations have been a breeze!</font>

153
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like you can take on 
a bit more work, then.</font>

154
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ugh, I said too much!</font>

155
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The second expedition is now over.</i></font>

156
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If we successfully complete 
the purification on the next,</i></font>

157
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>we'll have the miasma and the damage 
it's causing in each region under control.</i></font>

158
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Currently, the kingdom is prudently
 allowing the holy maiden to rest,</i></font>

159
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so a date has not yet been set 
for the third expedition.</i></font>

160
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Nevertheless, it should depart 
within a month's time.</i></font>

161
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Next, we'll need to get a budget approved 
to fund the research for our return home.</i></font>

162
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even after delegating some of my work 
to subordinates, there's lots to do.</i></font>

163
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And if I take work home, I can't get much
 done thanks to a certain someone.</i></font>

164
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Still, we're making such smooth progress</i></font>

165
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>because Aresh-sama is coordinating
 with other departments in advance.</i></font>

166
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama...</font>

167
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Returning home, huh?</i></font>

168
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That will mean leaving
 Aresh-sama's side...</i></font>

169
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Looks like I really need to think 
about things seriously soon.</i></font>

170
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sei-san! Sei-san!</font>

171
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Excellency is calling for you!</font>

172
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

173
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prime Minister!</font>

174
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter, Commander Indolark?</font>

175
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean, what's the matter?!</font>

176
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you sending someone from the 
accounting department to the church?</font>

177
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The person in question has 
already agreed. Isn't that right?</font>

178
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Quite correct.</font>

179
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, to start, why don't you have a seat?</font>

180
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's nothing to worry about.</font>

181
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seichiro's tea was specially 
prepared for him.</font>

182
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama, as I explained yesterday,</font>

183
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm being sent to the church
 to investigate,</font>

184
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as they've yet to submit their 
income and expenses report.</font>

185
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand that.</font>

186
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, there's no reason 
why it has to be you.</font>

187
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was my decision.</font>

188
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seichiro was the most suitable person 
to handle the miasma project.</font>

189
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The church houses sacred relics.</font>

190
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Several barriers are cast on them, and 
the magicule concentration there is high.</font>

191
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The likes of you have no business there.</font>

192
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And yet Seichiro survived the
demon forest without any issues.</font>

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was...</font>

194
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First things first, Commander Indolark...</font>

195
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As the commander of the third royal 
order and the son of an earl,</font>

196
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you should be more aware 
of your powerful influence.</font>

197
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

198
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand you're 
worried about Seichiro,</font>

199
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but your favoritism is so 
obvious that it's troubling.</font>

200
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seichiro is planning the miasma 
countermeasures on my orders...</font>

201
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least, that's the story on paper.</font>

202
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you side with him on top of that,</font>

203
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he gains enough political power
to breed unnecessary resentment.</font>

204
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He has a point...</i></font>

205
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'll only be commuting 
to the church for a month.</font>

206
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure any dishonorable rumors about
the third order will die down by then.</font>

207
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama, it's not a bad deal.</font>

208
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I secure the church's cooperation,
we'll make great strides</font>

209
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">toward the miasma countermeasures 
and relocation magic research.</font>

210
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When Aresh-sama casts off 
his commander persona,</i></font>

211
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>he sometimes looks a bit childish.</i></font>

212
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you laughing about?</font>

213
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your hair is still damp.</font>

214
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many times have I told 
you to dry it properly?</font>

215
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd say I dried it thoroughly enough.</font>

216
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How so? Good grief.</font>

217
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a nice fragrance.</i></font>

218
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The accounting department 
seems to like it, too.</i></font>

219
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There, it's dry.</font>

220
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

221
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not angry.</font>

222
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when even mere wind magic
 like this makes you feel sick,</font>

223
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">why do you keep choosing to go 
places that are dangerous to you?</font>

224
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly...</font>

225
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The church has a special barrier 
around it and, above all,</font>

226
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the act of prayer releases 
magical energy.</font>

227
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a hostile environment for you
on par with the demon forest.</font>

228
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Regardless, I had no choice but to accept.</i></font>

229
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then please ensure that I'm extra safe.</font>

230
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ninety percent of the Romany people are 
monotheistic and worship the god Abran.</i></font>

239
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,650

244
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I'd like to meet whoever's in charge.</font>

245
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The priest is busy.</font>

246
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He doesn't have time for you.</font>

247
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then may I speak to the person 
in charge of accounting?</font>

248
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not happening. Everyone's busy.</font>

249
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm here on official orders from the 
royal palace to conduct an inspection.</font>

250
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you hear that?</font>

251
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This arrogant man thinks he has
the right to inspect the church!</font>

252
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Civil servants from the palace

 I'm not welcome here.</i></font>

254
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But this is my job.</i></font>

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even the church won't get away

256
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In any case, no one here
 is going to work with you.</font>

257
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just do whatever you want

258
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

259
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I can do whatever I want?</font>

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their management of it is terrible...</font>

the old accounting department standards.</i></font>

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here?</font>

267
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry for intruding.</font>

268
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My name is Kondou Seiichirou, and I'm here
 from the royal accounting department.</font>

269
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal accounting department?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What business does a civil servant
 have with the church?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A church leader doesn't even
 know about the inspection?</i></font>

273
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I was ordered to come conduct an audit.</font>

276
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is a civil servant from the accounting
department alone in the library?</font>

277
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was no accountant or 
guide assigned to you?</font>

278
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone greeted me when I arrived,</font>

279
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I was simply told to do as I please,
so I began my investigation.</font>

280
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Who was your guide?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Either way, there's no
 reason to protect him.</i></font>

284
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't get his name,</font>

285
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but he was a boy around thirteen or
fourteen years old with green hair.</font>

286
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selio, was it?</font>

287
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selio, come to the

289
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am the priest here at the Romany royal 
capital branch of the Church of Abran.</font>

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was away at another branch for a few 
days, so I didn't realize the situation...</font>

292
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for the rude reception.</font>

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, this room is where 
we keep important documents</font>

298
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for trespassing 
without realizing that.</font>

299
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to once again request permission
 to conduct my inspection.</font>

300
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Siegvold-sama, did you call for—</font>

301
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What're you doing here?!</font>

302
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selio.</font>

303
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It won't do to run around 
the church recklessly.</font>

304
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sorry.</font>

305
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this who greeted you?</font>

306
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

307
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selio.</font>

308
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wasn't informed of any inspection 
from the royal palace.</font>

309
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who instructed you to meet with him?</font>

310
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... I...</font>

311
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bishop Mateus sent me a message and...</font>

312
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And?</font>

313
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This guy did this all on his own!</font>

our church for the first time,</font>

315
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,510

which areas are off-limits.</font>

316
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it not your job to guide
 him on such matters?</font>

317
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well, there's just so much to do...</font>

318
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More important than guiding this 
civil servant through the church?</font>

319
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No...</font>

320
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you leave the room?</font>

321
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I went to call you for lunch,

322
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You told me to do as I pleased.</font>

323
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was just a figure of speech!</font>

324
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Selio, lower your voice.</font>

325
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be that as it may, 
please understand that certain areas</font>

326

327
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

341
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're late.</font>

342
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,210

346
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,490

347
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,720

348
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you hungry?</font>

349
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not really...</font>

350
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take a bath.</font>

351
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,960

355
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could hardly call it comfortable.</font>

356
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,230

357
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,730
