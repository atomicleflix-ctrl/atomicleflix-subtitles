at it today? Jeez...</font>

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't eaten anything since 
this morning. I'm starving.</font>

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I eat when I get home?</font>

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? But I told you bigger was better.</font>

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we're going to make it fight, 
heavier is the best choice.</font>

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, then go find it and call back later.</font>

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did he go somewhere?</font>

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,360

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think it eats fish sausage?</font>

13
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,010

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,700

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's bamboo. They eat bamboo.</font>

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take the fish sausage.</font>

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No cameras on the emergency stairs!</font>

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,070

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Panda-senpai, are you really sure?</font>

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This could cause you trouble later.</font>

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,690

31
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,350

said, it couldn't get close!</i></font>

39
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've already marked Panda-chan.</i></font>

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,110

you and the higher-ups?</font>

72
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They fought with the conservatives.</font>

73
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their idea of "conservative" goes beyond 
just their policy toward the regulations.</font>

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They have set ideas of 
what jujutsu should be.</font>

75
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kugisaki's technique is a good example.</font>

76
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the kind of classic 
jujutsu the conservatives like.</font>

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not stuff like the cursed videos 
that were popular a while back.</font>

78
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As time goes on, even jujutsu 
incorporates more new technologies.</font>

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when even techniques 
start doing that,</font>

80
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the conservatives get fussy.</font>

81
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kin-chan's technique 
is a perfect example.</font>

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those stupid higher-ups lost 
because they're like that.</font>

83
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,320

Satoru Gojo wipe your asses, can't you?</font>

84
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,150

you need to rely on us.</font>

85
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,110

you're lying about relying on us,</font>

86
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,350

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,590

312
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,840

328
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

329
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,780
