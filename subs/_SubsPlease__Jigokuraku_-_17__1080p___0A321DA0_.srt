<font face="Times New Roman" size="20"><b>The Samurai Code and Carnage</b></font>

2
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An additional expedition?</font>

3
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

4
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been two days, and 
no one's returned with the Elixir.</font>

5
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two days?</font>

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The next group's incredible.</font>

7
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Four Yamada Asaemons, 
including <i>the</i> Shugen,</font>

8
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">four Iwagakure ninjas,</font>

9
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and over 50 subordinates to serve them.</font>

10
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They'll be a real boon 
to the first expedition.</font>

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}That idiot.</i></font>

12
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What reason is there to send 
this many forces for this job?</i></font>

13
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The ninja leader must have other plans.</i></font>

14
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aoki-dono.</font>

15
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does something concern you?</font>

16
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll be there to handle 
any possible threats.</font>

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But can you control this many people?</font>

18
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also...</font>

19
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those two are unranked, aren't they?</font>

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You needn't worry.</font>

21
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That youngster is 
Yamada Asaemon Kiyomaru.</font>

22
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's unranked due to his age,</font>

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but his skills make him 
one of the top two students.</font>

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yamada Asaemon Isuzu.</font>

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though she is a woman, she's a 
powerful and magnificent fighter.</font>

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She served the shogunate 
as a martial arts instructor.</font>

27
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They are what's known as "urayurushi."</font>

28
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rules prevent them from being ranked,</font>

29
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but they are as strong 
as any certified "okuyurushi."</font>

30
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We also have Jikka-dono, 
who is skilled, if nothing else.</font>

31
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's me. Skilled, if nothing else.</font>

32
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We do not intend to merely supervise.</font>

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will do everything we can 
for our fellow clan members.</font>

34
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you're worried, shall I 
demonstrate my skills, you old fart?</font>

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha—Kiyo-chan!</font>

37
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He underestimates us 
because we're unranked.</font>

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It pisses me off.</font>

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm definitely stronger than him.</font>

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, you shouldn't do that.</font>

41
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I could 
kill everyone here for you.</font>

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you wish.</font>

43
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? I struck the guy 
next to him on purpose.</font>

44
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They really don't move. Boring.</font>

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be rude to the ninjas.</font>

46
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Put your sword away, Kiyo-chan.</font>

47
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You, too, giantess.</font>

48
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Are these guys going to be okay?</i></font>

49
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

50
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Samurai mustn't argue 
over such a trifling matter.</font>

51
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't trouble yourselves with us.</font>

52
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm sorry you had to see that. 
Forgive us.</font>

53
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all. A ninja's life 
belongs to his master.</font>

54
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On this mission, 
the Yamadas are our masters.</font>

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you doubt us, select anyone here.</font>

56
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They will be thrown overboard 
or executed to demonstrate our loyalty.</font>

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah?</font>

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, you.</font>

59
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show me a ninja's loyalty.</font>

60
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

61
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rest is up to you.</font>

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>You may go in, you may enter.</i></font>

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Whose narrow path is this?</i></font>

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is the narrow pathway 
of the Tenjin shrine...</i></font>

65
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinobi do not have wills 
or minds of their own.</font>

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our greatest desire is 
to be merely a tool.</font>

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ask that you trust us.</font>

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">E-Enough. Return to your positions.</font>

69
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your resolve is powerful. I'm impressed.</font>

70
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really get ninjas.</font>

71
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Join the mission and kill Gabimaru.</font>

72
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't expect him 
to be sent on that mission</font>

73
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">before he could be 
assassinated at his execution.</font>

74
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Surely you won't be satisfied 
unless you kill him, too.</font>

75
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gabimaru must be killed.</font>

76
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use your lives for solely that purpose.</font>

77
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure we can 
trust them, Shugen-san?</font>

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't trusted them from the start.</font>

79
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those ruffians are 
no different from criminals.</font>

80
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll search for the Elixir ourselves. 
Just us Asaemons.</font>

81
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about the criminals on the island?</font>

82
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Execute every criminal you find.</font>

83
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will bring back every last Asaemon.</font>

84
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Eizen-dono, everyone...</i></font>

85
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Please be safe.</i></font>

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being a manager sure is tough, huh?</font>

87
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Managing all these rogues 
must hinder your work.</font>

88
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can't be helped.</font>

89
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The shogun is hoping 
to complete the mission quickly.</font>

90
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said we'd make good allies 
for the first expedition.</font>

91
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be joking.</font>

92
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, this ship 
isn't transporting allies.</font>

93
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're bringing more death and chaos.</font>

94
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're the ship of dreams 
bearing nightmares and disaster.</font>

95
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, so many more will die.</font>

96
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one will make it back alive.</font>

97
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An additional expedition?</font>

98
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. It could be Shugen's group.</font>

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eizen-san was ordered by the shogunate 
to select a reserve group of Asaemons.</font>

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shu-kun could probably lead a group 
of condemned criminals, too.</font>

101
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will Shugen be our ally?</font>

102
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, surely.</font>

103
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the most skilled of the Yamadas.</font>

104
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His combat experience is first class, too.</font>

105
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not enough 
to survive on this island.</font>

106
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to master the tricks of tao.</font>

107
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a trick!</font>

108
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen can probably perceive tao.</font>

109
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When we practiced together, 
he seemed aware of my sixth sense.</font>

110
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a serious man through and through.</font>

111
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He fervently tried to learn from me.</font>

112
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the one who named them waves.</font>

113
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isuzu. Hold this.</font>

114
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? How are you going to 
fight that without a weapon?</font>

115
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be eaten.</font>

116
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That masterwork was 
a gift from the shogun.</font>

117
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is my pride as an executioner.</font>

118
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't use it to hunt a boar.</font>

119
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fuchi-kun taught me.</font>

120
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The structure and tension of muscles 
can be estimated from the outside.</font>

121
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can use that 
to easily dissect or destroy.</font>

122
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shion-dono taught me as well.</font>

123
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you observe the waves, you can 
estimate the structure of a life.</font>

124
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he's that strong, it'll be great 
to have him on our side!</font>

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is something wrong, Sensei?</font>

126
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I know Yamada Asaemon Shugen.</font>

127
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was involved 
in that incident, wasn't he?</font>

128
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Incident? Did he cause a problem?</font>

129
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I wouldn't call it a problem.</font>

130
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can be a bit too harsh.</font>

131
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of incident?</font>

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've only heard about it.</font>

133
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the boss of the Silver Serpent clan, 
a famous Edo yakuza, was captured,</font>

134
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he refused to give the locations of his 
underlings hidden throughout the region.</font>

135
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He caused the officials 
quite a bit of trouble.</font>

136
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then Shugen-dono was summoned.</font>

137
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He beheaded his already 
captured underlings</font>

138
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">before his eyes to make him talk</font>

139
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and slaughtered all 
20 members of the clan,</font>

140
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">including the underlings they found.</font>

141
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The shogun was delighted,</font>

142
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">gave him special attire and the 
famous blade Fuributsu Kaneaki,</font>

143
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and Shugen-dono gained influence 
within the shogunate as well.</font>

144
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he kills all evil-doers.</font>

145
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like a pretty cool guy.</font>

146
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's a good person at heart.</font>

147
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's kind to all the students.</font>

148
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he's Sagi's first love.</font>

149
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Tell me more.</font>

150
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want to marry him?</font>

151
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I...</font>

152
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was a child.</font>

153
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose I did admire him.</font>

154
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen-dono was the reason 
I became ranked in the Yamada clan.</font>

155
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please grant Sagiri a rank as well.</font>

156
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you refuse to acknowledge 
her marvelous skill,</font>

157
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then I cannot proudly bear my own rank.</font>

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's rigid, but he's kind.</font>

159
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen-san, are you hurt?</font>

160
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd said something, 
we would've helped.</font>

161
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our orders are to supervise and execute.</font>

162
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You needn't dirty your blades 
for anything else.</font>

163
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm your elder. Allow me 
to handle such trivial matters.</font>

164
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your eyes are scary 
even when you're smiling.</font>

165
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they?</font>

166
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure are dependable, though.</font>

167
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jikka-dono, you're older than me.</font>

168
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's hurry.</font>

169
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once he learns of the situation, 
he'll surely help us.</font>

170
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I don't think so.</font>

171
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a bit mistaken 
about that story you told.</font>

172
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all, it's not something 
the Yamadas like to discuss.</font>

173
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

174
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen executed 20 yakuza 
and their entire clan.</font>

175
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, like I said, 20...</font>

176
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

177
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Twenty Silver Serpents
and their entire clan.</font>

178
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their families, their elderly parents, 
even young children.</font>

179
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In total, over 100 of them.</font>

180
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How could you?</font>

181
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yataro... He's just a baby...</font>

182
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have to kill him, too?</font>

183
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is painful but unavoidable.</font>

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I'd executed only you, your family 
would've inherited your business.</font>

185
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Evil is born not just from people's hearts</font>

186
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the environment 
in which they're raised, too.</font>

187
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I pray you're at least reborn 
as a good person in your next life.</font>

188
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're inhuman... You're inhuman...</font>

189
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're inhuman...</font>

190
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like him as a samurai, 
and he's a friend.</font>

191
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I don't think Shugen will let 
a single criminal off the hook,</font>

192
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">no matter the circumstances.</font>

193
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In fact, he probably wouldn't forgive any 
Asaemons who protect criminals either.</font>

194
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the kind of man he is.</font>

195
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially if he learns what's 
happening on this island.</font>

196
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So your name is Shugen.</font>

197
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your parents were slain 
when you were young,</font>

198
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and by some fate, we took you in.</font>

199
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being an executioner 
will be difficult for you.</font>

200
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll be faced with all kinds of crimes.</font>

201
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My parents' murderer 
still hasn't been caught.</font>

202
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Perhaps I'll get to behead them someday.</font>

203
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear the Yamada Asaemons consider</font>

204
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a single painless and 
emotionless strike ideal.</font>

205
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's correct.</font>

206
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand. 
It's better to do it poorly.</font>

207
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Strike multiple times to sever the head.</font>

208
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a more painful death.</font>

209
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about damaging 
the blade to make it jagged?</font>

210
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would be pointless.</font>

211
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I'll sharpen it.</font>

212
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will be difficult to erase 
your hatred right away,</font>

213
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but through learning and teaching here, 
you will learn how to face it.</font>

214
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you still wish 
to damage it then, you may.</font>

215
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll sharpen it again and again.</font>

216
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someday your blade will have 
a beautiful pattern.</font>

217
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I look forward to it.</font>

218
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eizen-dono!</font>

219
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... I still need you.</font>

220
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I still need you!</font>

221
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen-san.</font>

222
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it's hard, but we must proceed.</font>

223
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm concerned about the others.</font>

224
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

225
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least let us put him to rest.</font>

226
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

227
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

228
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're a strange group.</i></font>

229
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He chants sutras at his leisure
on an island of monsters,</i></font>

230
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and the other two are strange 
for going along with it.</i></font>

231
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I suppose he's just that powerful a man.</i></font>

232
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, this man is odd as well.</i></font>

233
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't get a read on him at all.</i></font>

234
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to go home...</i></font>

235
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But this dangerous island is the perfect 
place to outwit the Asaemons.</i></font>

236
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We'll look for an opportunity 
to complete our mission.</i></font>

237
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This island wouldn't 
be enough to kill him.</i></font>

238
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, look at the size of those.</font>

239
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Capture as many alive as possible.</font>

240
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It speaks. 
Is it different from the others?</font>

241
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can speak, let's talk this out.</font>

242
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do not have the right to do that.</font>

243
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must speak with the Tensen.</font>

244
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Shugen-san is mourning!</font>

245
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She threw it off balance.</i></font>

246
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa.</font>

247
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are plenty more, Kiyo-chan.</font>

248
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, shut up. I know.</font>

249
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their skills are incredible.</font>

250
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right?</font>

251
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us demonstrate ours.</font>

252
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arakagi, kill that one.</font>

253
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As you wish.</font>

254
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bakuro Squad, Ishifudo Squad, go.</font>

255
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Individually, our strength 
is no match for the Yamadas,</font>

256
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but ninjas operate in groups.</font>

257
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The strength of one bows 
to the strength of many.</font>

258
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the greatest hero 
cannot withstand such numbers.</font>

259
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is how the individually 
inferior genin fight.</font>

260
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Genin, huh?</font>

261
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rest in peace.</font>

262
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen-san!</font>

263
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow!</font>

264
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

265
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Monsters.</font>

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, all creatures on this island.</font>

267
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll kill you all 
as painfully as possible.</font>

268
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

269
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall kill you and 
present you as a gift...</font>

270
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so that I may be promoted to chisen.</font>

271
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So there's a limit to your regeneration.</font>

272
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Each time you do not answer 
the questions I'm about to ask,</font>

273
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or I don't like your answer, 
I'll cut off more.</font>

274
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, your allies.</font>

275
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you have some kind of group 
structure, describe it in detail.</font>

276
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

277
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speak quickly. You're wasting time.</font>

278
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, now, Shugen.</font>

279
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We discovered a new type of monster.</font>

280
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you say we return 
to the mainland to report our findings?</font>

281
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! You simply wish 
to go home, Jikka-dono.</font>

282
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You didn't even draw your blade.</font>

283
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't. You know that.</font>

284
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm saying you can. I know it.</font>

285
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Calm down, Shugen-san.</font>

286
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arguing won't help anything.</font>

287
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

288
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me.</font>

289
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got over-excited 
and was rude to my elder.</font>

290
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine. It doesn't bother me.</font>

291
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Forgive me, both of you.</font>

292
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This side of him is cute...</i></font>

293
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Aw, man. That looked fun.</font>

294
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Kiyo-chan!</font>

295
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if we return empty-handed,</font>

296
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">our clan's name and Eizen-dono's 
honor will be tarnished.</font>

297
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll kill every living thing 
on the island.</font>

298
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We must teach them what happens 
when you harm a Yamada student.</font>

299
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And for that, we need information.</font>

300
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shugen-sama, please allow us to 
handle the torture and interrogation.</font>

301
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What looks like mist 
is dense tao particles.</font>

302
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can use it to detect 
changes on the island,</font>

303
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you can't identify 
the people who landed.</font>

304
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

305
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Tensen and the newcomers...</font>

306
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Things keep getting more complicated.</font>

307
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think we should split into two groups.</font>

308
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two groups?</font>

309
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One group to acquire the Elixir, and 
one group to secure an escape route.</font>

310
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Then I'm on Team Escape.</font>

311
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Team Secure an Escape Route.</font>

312
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mei told me we'll have to 
pass through Horai either way.</font>

313
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? But we can leave from the shore.</font>

314
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are monsters in the sea, too.</font>

315
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have a plan 
for fighting the Tensen?</font>

316
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had her confirm my speculation.</font>

317
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

318
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tao has attributes, 
which have compatibilities.</font>

319
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:48,060
<font face="Arial Black" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font color="#575d61">Wood</font></b></font>

320
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:51,310
<font face="Arial Black" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font color="#575d61">Metal</font></b></font>

321
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:51,150
<font face="Arial Black" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font color="#575d61">Fire</font></b></font>

322
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:49,940
<font face="Arial Black" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font color="#575d61">Water</font></b></font>

323
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are strong and weak matchups.</font>

324
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">These can be used to weaken an 
enemy's tao or strengthen an ally's.</font>

325
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,310
<font face="Arial Black" size="20"><b>{\an8}<font color="#575d61">Earth</font></b></font>

326
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They may be beyond human understanding,</font>

327
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but if tao is the source 
of their strength,</font>

328
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they cannot escape this principle.</font>

329
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know it will work against them.</font>

330
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not good enough.</font>

331
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How effective will it be?</font>

332
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you guarantee we won't die?</font>

333
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too dangerous to enter 
the enemy's base like that.</font>

334
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it more realistic 
to leave the island and hide?</font>

335
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, we should act alone.</font>

336
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right, Yuzuriha.</font>

337
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This group ended up together 
by coincidence.</font>

338
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have no obligation or bonds 
compelling us to work together.</font>

339
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are too many uncertainties.</font>

340
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are the newcomers?</font>

341
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aside from that...</font>

342
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there could be something else unexpected.</font>

343
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't predict what 
will happen or who will die.</font>

344
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you should decide for yourselves 
what you want to do.</font>

345
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'll come with me, 
join me in the cave.</font>

346
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you choose to go 
your own way, that's fine.</font>

347
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll ignore your standing, too.</font>

348
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, uh...</font>

349
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shouldn't you think about it more?</font>

350
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That felt too quick.</font>

351
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At this point, 
we're in it together. Right?</font>

352
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't care as long 
as I make it back home,</font>

353
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but it's better to have more shields.</font>

354
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really get it, but we can 
kill at least one Tensen, right?</font>

355
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was pointless to ask.</font>

356
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Working together is 
the most logical choice</font>

357
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for anyone who wants to go home.</font>

358
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm simply performing my duties.</font>

359
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll see this through.</font>

360
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you planning to say 
goodbye to me, Sensei?</font>

361
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, nothing like that, but...</font>

362
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know, but still!</font>

363
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if we get the Elixir, 
only one of us gets a pardon.</font>

364
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can fight over it on the boat back.</font>

365
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, I'm relieved.</font>

366
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's better to have more allies.</font>

367
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's escape together.</font>

368
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:07,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This chaotic situation 
is our greatest and final chance.</font>
