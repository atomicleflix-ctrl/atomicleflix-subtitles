1
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tonome?</font>

2
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You ready?</font>

3
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on out, then!</font>

5
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, looks grea—</font>

6
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, it's just you in a high 
school uniform instead of a suit.</font>

7
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's not as if you 
can judge my age at a glance.</font>

8
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san is dressed like a student?!</font>

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's somehow extremely adorable!</font>

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's really not worth 
getting excited over...</font>

11
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your next investigation is 
in a place frequented by students, right?</font>

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, and since you 
can't eyeball his age,</font>

13
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he's perfect for an undercover operation.</font>

14
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It fits, though, and I think 
it gets the point across.</font>

15
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay!</font>

16
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then...</font>

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next up, Kikira!</font>

18
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daichi! Can I take pictures?!</font>

19
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not cosplaying.</font>

20
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you've got the vibe.</font>

21
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll totally fit in.</font>

22
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds like both Kikira-san's
 and my disguise are acceptable.</font>

23
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that wraps up our prep—</font>

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hey.</font>

25
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who said it's over?</font>

26
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-oh.</font>

27
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't modeled your disguise yet.</font>

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah, I'm good! It's nothing 
anyone wants to see anyway...</font>

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't get to say that 
after putting <i>me</i> through this!</font>

30
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine!</font>

31
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried it 
on before I got here!</font>

32
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You sneaky little...!</font>

33
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, as long as it fits her, 
I'm sure it's fine...</font>

34
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}It's not a big deal!{bg}</font>

35
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Yes, it is!{bg}</font>

36
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is Jarashi's outfit?</font>

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the uniform of our 
next undercover target.</font>

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here we go!</font>

39
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Moke-moke kyun!</font>

40
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did I have to dress like this?</font>

41
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What do you want?</i></font>

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The target we're after is a regular here.</i></font>

43
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They're not here yet,</i></font>

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but quit being shy 
and maintain your cover.</i></font>

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not being shy!</font>

46
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, a new maid!</font>

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your pattern's really cute!</font>

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Do your damn job.</i></font>

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna.</font>

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Man... Plain fur is so nice.</i></font>

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}It lets your outfit be the focus,</i></font>

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}and it's so soft and cute.</i></font>

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was so exhausting!</font>

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}There, there! Well done!</font>

55
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The place was full of cute little girls 
who looked great in their maid uniforms!</font>

56
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Akira-san said you blended in 
and got information about your target.</font>

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it's not like 
I wasn't gonna do my job.</font>

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just not cut out for this, 
and I know I'm not cute,</font>

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so it made me uncomfortable.</font>

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well,</font>

61
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what you look like,</font>

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I can't weigh in on your cuteness.</font>

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

64
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You <i>feel</i> very cute to me.</font>

65
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm happy I get to 
snuggle your softness.</font>

66
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's sexual harassment!</font>

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is?!</font>

68
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me stroke <i>your</i> skin 
and we'll call it even.</font>

69
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that sexual harassment, too?!</font>

70
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, let's buy clothes again sometime!</font>

71
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A real shopping spree!</font>

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another girls' day out, huh?</font>

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cute! It's another knockout!</font>

74
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, this new one's cute, too!</font>

75
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait a minute!</font>

76
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The shopping spree is just for me?</font>

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, why?</font>

78
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really don't want to 
steal all the focus.</font>

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't we buy things for you as well?</font>

80
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, it's no big!</font>

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love watching you try on outfits!</font>

82
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not a dress-up doll, you know.</font>

83
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a bit worn out, 
so I'm going to take a break.</font>

84
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, enjoy shopping without me!</font>

85
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Sure...</font>

86
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}My fur pattern is just so aggressive, 
it makes it hard to pick out clothes...</i></font>

87
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}The outfit's cute...</i></font>

88
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}But if I wear it, 
the two patterns will clash.</i></font>

89
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can try that on, if you'd like.</font>

90
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I <i>wouldn't</i> like that, thanks!</font>

91
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shizuka, have you ever 
envied other people?</font>

92
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Envied them?</font>

93
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like... people who can see?</font>

94
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what it's like to see, 
so it never occurred to me to be jealous.</font>

95
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, so that's how it works?</font>

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you, Jarashi-san?</font>

97
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I envy you a lot, Shizuka.</font>

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me?</font>

99
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're all one color.</font>

100
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One color?</font>

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So cute clothes look good on you!</font>

102
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, Jarashi-san, you want to 
wear cute clothing?</font>

104
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I can't pull it off!</font>

105
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The maids and customers in the 
maid cafe all said I looked good, but...</font>

106
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not what I want.</font>

107
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter how much everyone 
else compliments me,</font>

108
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's not the kind of cute I want to be.</font>

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way I want to look is...</font>

110
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'll probably never 
see myself as cute.</font>

111
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't laugh, okay?</font>

112
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... I've been thinking 
of dying my fur...</font>

113
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Bleaching out my pattern so I'm plain.</font>

114
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds good to me!</font>

115
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that easy!</font>

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it more serious than it sounds?</font>

117
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, my family line comes 
from bobcat people in the Americas.</font>

118
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Our fur patterns 
are proof of our heritage.</font>

119
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was born and raised here, so...</font>

120
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I don't owe 
anyone anything, but...</font>

121
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just remembered 
something Akira-san said!</font>

122
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a fast change of subject!</font>

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Akira-san sometimes whispers his 
thoughts about things he's looking at.</font>

124
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a full moon tonight. It's beautiful.</font>

125
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is the full moon beautiful?</font>

126
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that you mention it, I'm not sure.</font>

127
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it beautiful to have a round golden 
ball against the blackness of the sky?</font>

128
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means...</font>

129
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A yuzu fruit on a bed 
of nori seaweed would be pretty?</font>

130
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is that?</font>

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I was a child, I was taught 
that yuzu fruit is round and yellow,</font>

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and nori seaweed is big and black!</font>

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

134
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like that, though.</font>

135
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a full moon night just 
for you and me.</font>

136
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just for Akira-san and me...</font>

137
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">C'mon, Shizuka!</font>

138
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get lost in thought 
and giggle to yourself.</font>

139
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'm sorry!</font>

140
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what was it Tonome said?</font>

141
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... that's a secret!</font>

142
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey!</font>

143
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it sounds like you're 
feeling torn about it, right?</font>

144
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess.</font>

145
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Normally, when you make up your mind,</font>

146
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you don't need anyone's advice 
to go through with it.</font>

147
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">True...</font>

148
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think maybe you haven't found 
the answer you're comfortable with yet.</font>

149
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The answer...</font>

150
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you probably don't have to commit to</font>

151
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"I need plain fur" or "I don't look 
good in cute clothing" just yet.</font>

152
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What I mean is,</font>

153
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you may not really see your 
pattern as flaw after all.</font>

154
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y'know, we've got that in other colors.</font>

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, it clashes with my pattern, 
so I figured I'd pass...</font>

156
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine. It's possible 
to make mixed pattern outfits.</font>

157
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A pattern on a pattern!</i></font>

158
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd be better with a cinched belt 
and a color that matches your fur.</font>

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, maybe...</font>

160
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take your time, now!</font>

161
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you believe this, Tonome-chan?!</font>

162
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No hugging, please.</font>

163
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Invisible hands are stopping me!</font>

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it now?</font>

165
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My wife's gone back
to her parents again!</font>

166
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did she say why?</font>

167
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her dad's in the hospital 
and she has to look after him!</font>

168
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. How awful.</font>

169
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please...</font>

170
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me stay here 
until Light's back, please!</font>

171
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you want that?!</font>

172
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I end up in a negative mood 
when Light's not around.</font>

173
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I could vent some curses on 
your investigations like I did before...</font>

174
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what about your shop?</font>

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's shuttered for now.</font>

176
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I don't vent my curses, they'll leak 
out and affect all kinds of things.</font>

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Affect things how?</font>

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just little misfortunes here and there!</font>

179
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So let me help until Light 
gets back! Please, Tonome-sama!</font>

180
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand, 
but how long will she be gone?</font>

181
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About five month, she says.</font>

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, there's a deadline?</font>

183
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means...</font>

184
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Five months...</font>

185
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't get to see her 
for five whole months!</font>

186
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please calm down!</font>

187
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Five months?</i></font>

188
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Five months sounds like...</i></font>

189
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do I look, Jarashi-san?</font>

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it all working?</font>

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you've got it.</font>

192
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Shizuka, she's here!</font>

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sorry for the wait!</i></font>

194
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's been so long, Light-san!</i></font>

195
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Seriously!</i></font>

196
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for checking in, you two!</font>

197
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are you doing, Light?</font>

198
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Just great!</i></font>

199
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Light-san, I heard your father 
was in the hospital...</font>

200
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is he all right?</font>

201
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well...</i></font>

202
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's not, actually.</i></font>

203
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The truth is...</i></font>

204
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am currently with child!</font>

205
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yes! I knew it!</i></font>

206
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Nice one!</i></font>

207
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Congrats!</i></font>

208
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Congratulations!</i></font>

209
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thank you!</i></font>

210
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why aren't you 
telling Karma about this?</font>

211
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well...</i></font>

212
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know about Karma's dark 
elf curse powers, right?</font>

213
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a white elf, which means I have 
the power of blessings.</font>

214
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Normally, our powers 
cancel each other out.</font>

215
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But elves as a race have 
a low pregnancy rate,</i></font>

216
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>so when one of us is carrying, 
they make a big deal out of it.</i></font>

217
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How so?</i></font>

218
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once we know we're pregnant,</font>

219
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we spend time in the sacred elf 
forest in the white elf village.</font>

220
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We perform rituals to pray 
for a safe birth,</font>

221
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">where the people spend every 
day casting blessings on us...</font>

222
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and the elves in the village 
support us every way they can.</font>

223
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The whole princess treatment!</i></font>

224
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It really is great!</font>

225
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But because the life 
I'm carrying is so precious,</font>

226
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and if anything were to happen to me...</font>

227
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know he'd blame himself.</font>

228
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd think his curses are to blame.</font>

229
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know that would make our lives harder, 
so I'm keeping it from him.</font>

230
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's very frank of you.</i></font>

231
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But don't you feel nervous

232
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,990

233
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's more that I'm worried about

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}I won't tell her that he

235
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He stormed our agency in tears.</i></font>

236
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Jarashi-san...</font>

237
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's getting rather cold 
at night, isn't it?</font>

238
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What shall we get to eat tonight?</font>

239
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm craving something warm!</font>

240
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hot pot!</font>

241
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's that.</font>

242
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What kind of hot pot shall we have?</font>

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about tomato hot pot?</font>

244
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd love that! Shall 
we have it at my house?</font>

245
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'll cut the vegetables.</font>

246
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wash them, please.</font>

247
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Right...</font>

248
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{M}Is it all right for

251
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is?</font>

252
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Watch what you're cutting!</font>

253
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...Isn't something you 
need to do, I guess.</font>

254
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This makes me really happy.</font>

255
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does?</font>

256
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We've gotten closer

258
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,290

259
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it?</font>

260
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a smell

261
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,940
