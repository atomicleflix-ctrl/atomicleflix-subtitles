102
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,610

It's not even the issue.</font>

103
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,590

104
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,820

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure about that? 
Is that your idea of fun?</font>

129
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We really are. And you're bothering us.
Go pick up girls somewhere else.</font>

130
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Man, you're no fun.</font>

131
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And here we were, 
lowering the bar for you.</font>

132
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know you're not all that hot, right?</font>

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it right there, guys.</font>

134
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

135
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I happened to overhear your rudeness
 towards my friends here.</font>

136
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not very nice.</font>

137
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should apologize.</font>

138
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

139
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you understand the words
 coming out of my mouth?</font>

140
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe you should apologize...</font>

141
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while I'm still feeling nice.</font>

142
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-We're sorry!</font>

143
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry 'bout that. 
Got a little distracted on the way back.</font>

144
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll make it up to you 
by getting us drinks.</font>

145
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go, Ogata.</font>

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bet.</font>

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Talk about great timing.</i></font>

148
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I couldn't say a single thing
 in my defense.</i></font>

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I just didn't have the words.</i></font>

150
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Do I even have the right to defend myself?</i></font>

151
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Am I really 100% innocent here?</i></font>

152
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I made a promise to him that I wouldn't
 fall in love with Number Seven.</i></font>

153
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I wasn't able to keep that promise.</i></font>

154
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's only natural he hit me 
because of it. I did something wrong.</i></font>

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you promise me?</font>

156
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font color="#ffffff">I can.</font></font>

157
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You okay, Ogata-san?</font>

158
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come on!</font>

159
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}MF Ghost.</i></font>

160
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, I'm really sorry.</font>

161
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know how to make it up
 to you and Ren-chan.</font>

162
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm prepared to commit seppuku.</font>

163
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay, Ogata-san. Forget about it.</font>

164
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think Ren's a little mad, but I'm sure
 it'll blow over, so don't worry.</font>

165
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's only natural Aiba-senpai got mad.
 I'm the one in the wrong.</font>

166
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are you in the wrong, man?
You didn't know it was her.</font>

167
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">No.<font face="Trebuchet MS"> All through summer break after 
I found out, I didn't do a thing about it.</font></font></font>

168
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I'll keep an eye out 
for a chance to explain to Shun.</font>

169
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nah. I doubt it'd satisfy 
Aiba-senpai, anyway.</font>

170
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please don't do anything, Ogata-san.</font>

171
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You say that, but...</font>

172
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's this?</font>

173
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello?</font>

174
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">J-J-Just a moment, please.</font></font>

175
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please talk to whoever 
this is for me, Kanata.</font>

176
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a woman who started speaking 
English really fast at me.</font>

177
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't catch a word of it.</font>

178
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Hello?</font></font>

179
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emma? Emma Greene? Is it really you?</font>

180
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where are you calling from?
Huh? Odawara? <font face="Times New Roman">Really?</font></font>

181
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, of course it was a surprise 
that you ran off all of a sudden.</font>

182
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that you're an MFG Angel.</font>

183
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Yuka.</font>

184
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm scared to ask, but how'd things
 go afterwards? At the beach.</font>

185
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you see, the thing is...</font>

186
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was fun. Ogata-san and 
Shun-san are really nice,</font>

187
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and since they're adults, we felt safe.</font>

188
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The lunch we had at the shack 
by the beach was full of flavor.</font>

189
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I don't think I've ever had guys 
fawning over me like that my whole life.</font>

190
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">R-Really? You had a good time?</font>

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup!</font>

192
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I feel like I kinda missed out.</i></font>

193
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They even have nice tans. No fair.</i></font>

194
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Verdana"><font size="22"><font color="#3a444a">Ogata Automotive Ltd.</font></font></font></font>

195
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wow, an Aston Martin!</font>

196
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's a Vantage in 
British racing green. <font face="Times New Roman">Cool!</font></font>

197
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm disappointed.</font>

198
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Oh, hey, a Vantage. So cool."
 That's moron talk.</font>

199
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emma.</font>

200
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I finally get to see my ex
 after all this time.</font>

201
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was expecting a more 
romantic reaction than that.</font>

202
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your ex? Me? I seem to remember us
 only ever being friends.</font>

203
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We were a couple.</font>

204
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, no, we weren't.</font>

205
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've changed, Kanata.</font>

206
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't have that harsh look
 in your eyes anymore.</font>

207
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm more curious about 
what you're doing in Japan.</font>

208
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That should be obvious. 
Don't you see the number?</font>

209
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to be racing in MFG.</font>

210
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though just for one race.</font>

211
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd really rather you didn't. 
It's a bad fit for you.</font>

212
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's rather a rude thing to say
to your old RDRS classmate.</font>

213
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The stuff we learned there won't be
 enough to help you do well in MFG.</font>

214
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You do realize I'm a current BTCC driver,
 right? Don't underestimate me.</font>

215
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did Fujiwara-sensei give his permission?</font>

216
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need permission. 
I graduated a long time ago.</font>

217
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You might have been top of 
the class while I was third,</font>

218
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I've grown a lot this past year.</font>

219
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After your hiatus, 
I won't be outdone by you.</font>

220
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm heading off now, Kanata.
 I'll be in touch.</font>

221
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love you, darling.</font>

222
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She was gorgeous. Blonde hair, 
blue eyes, and boobs like whoa!</i></font>

223
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is bad. She's going 
to be racing in MFG.</font>

224
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could tell. There was a number
 on her door panel.</font>

225
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Aston Martin's a bit of an unknown.</font>

226
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't ever recall anyone 
driving one in MFG before.</font>

227
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is she fast?</font>

228
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. <font face="Trebuchet MS">She was my classmate at the academy.</font></font></font>

229
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's very skilled 
with good driving sense.</font>

230
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And she's not just fast.</font>

231
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's dangerous.</font>

232
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good session, Miss Greene.</font>

233
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After just an hour and a half,</font>

234
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you're within two-tenths of 
Akaba Kaito's course record.</font>

235
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I question whether the lap time I posted</font>

236
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">with the data we entered for the Vantage
 will translate to the circuit.</font>

237
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It should be fairly accurate,
 given it's the latest version.</font>

238
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It might be an odd thing
 to talk about in this place...</font>

239
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I was curious why seafood back home
 is so comparatively dire,</font>

240
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I looked it up.</font>

241
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The reason is apparently simple.</font>

242
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a profound lack of biodiversity 
in the species found around England.</font>

243
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the waters around Japan have a huge
variety of species, and in greater numbers.</font>

244
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The ocean around Japan 
has a whole host of currents,</font>

245
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so there's an oceanographic reason 
for the large plankton population.</font>

246
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are also over 
35,000 rivers in Japan,</font>

247
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">which carry stuff for the plankton
 to feast on out to sea.</font>

248
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But the whole world 
has coastal areas, right?</font>

249
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shouldn't there be 
a bunch of places like that?</font>

250
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be it in the Mediterranean or 
off the islands around Southeast Asia,</font>

251
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there are fewer varieties of fish.</font>

252
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not exaggerating when I say 
Japan is unique in the world.</font>

253
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a country blessed 
with its aquatic properties.</font>

254
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a sea of miracles,
 crafted by God.</font>

255
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This country has an almost 
unfair share of divine gifts.</font>

256
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">MFG's front-runners apparently
 come here to train.</font>

257
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Katagiri Kanata is the exception.
 He hasn't come here once.</font>

258
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kanata Rivington
 is indeed exceptional.</font>

259
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:23,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the kind of person who can 
conquer a course in very little time.</font>

260
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's creative and eccentric 
to an absurd degree.</font>

261
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He earned himself the nickname:
 the "Silent Artist."</font>

262
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone at the academy, from students 
to teachers, was astounded at his speed.</font>

263
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna use the simulator every day until
 the race to get familiar with the course.</font>

264
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please make the arrangements, Hayato.</font>

265
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emma. I'm not sure about that.</font>

266
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. I guess I will.</font>

267
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ren, a friend of mine from England 
will be at Enoshima station soon.</font>

268
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd like to introduce you,
if you don't mind.</font>

269
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

270
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I don't mind. 
I'd love to meet any friend of yours.</font>

271
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should probably tell you now
that she's a woman.</font>

272
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But our relationship 
isn't anything special,</font>

273
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so please don't get the wrong idea.</font>

274
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's not a bad person,</font>

275
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but she can come on a little strong,
and she might be kind of rude to you.</font>

276
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If she is, I'll be sure to correct her.</font>

277
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

278
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emma, let me introduce you to Ren,
my host family's daughter.</font>

279
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you.</font>

280
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. So you and Kanata
 are going steady, are you?</font>

281
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Emma, I won't let you harass Ren.</font>

282
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you don't stop, I'll leave now.</font>

283
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And go back to the house 
where you two are living together?</font>

284
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a scandalous suggestion.</font>

285
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't stand it. 
You're breaking my heart.</font>

286
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you expect me to say to that?</font>

287
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I almost lost my cool there.</i></font>

288
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Let's start over.</i></font>

289
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a cute body she's got.</i></font>

290
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Japanese women seem to keep 
their thin, girlish figures as they mature.</i></font>

291
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's take a break 
somewhere cool, shall we?</font>

292
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ren, Emma hasn't been 
in Japan long, so I'll translate.</font>

293
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since when were you 
such a gentleman, Kanata?</i></font>

294
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's a bit different from 
how you treat me, isn't it?</i></font>

295
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, don't mind me, Kanata. 
After all, your friend came all this way.</font>

296
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I should be able to understand 
about 70% of your conversation, I think.</font>

297
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been taking English lessons
 since I was little.</font>

298
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be pretty well off. Very clever.</font>

299
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to say, this heat should 
be wrecking my appetite.</font>

300
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:13,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet the food here is so good,
 I end up eating anyway.</font>

301
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes.</font></font>

302
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should try the more reasonably priced 
restaurants, too, not just hotel food.</font>

303
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I reckon you'll be shocked at the quality.</font>

304
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't sound so proud of that. 
You're not from here.</font>

305
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, what are you even doing here?
This path makes no sense to me.</font>

306
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd committed to 
competing in British FE3,</font>

307
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you'd be in the running for 
the Young Driver of the Year award.</font>

308
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Every British driver dreams 
of winning that.</font>

309
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand what happened to your mum,
 and you have my sympathy,</font>

310
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that doesn't excuse 
throwing it all away.</font>

311
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you realize how many people
 you disappointed?</font>

312
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd rather not talk about it, Emma.
 What's done is done.</font>

313
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, too bad. You still seem 
like you're running away.</font>

314
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't where you belong.</font>

315
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm saying this because 
I care about you deeply.</font>

316
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's frankly foolishness to waste 
your God-given talents like this.</font>

317
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have the kind of talent 
you're talking about, Emma.</font>

318
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:29,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And even if I did, it would be
a gift from my parents, not God.</font>

319
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't give me that atheist crap.</font>

320
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's unpleasant. I don't like
 this version of Kanata.</font>

321
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can decide what's best
 for me myself, Emma.</font>

322
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm 100% sure coming to Japan
 was the right decision.</font>

323
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have no right to criticize it.</font>

324
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Times New Roman">Sorry.<font face="Trebuchet MS"> I need to use
 the little boys' room.</font></font></font>

325
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're in high school, right, Ren?</font>

326
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

327
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you like Kanata, right?
 It's easy to tell.</font>

328
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're still just a kid 
while you're in school.</font>

329
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not independent.</font>

330
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Kanata's an adult.</font>

331
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Romance should be between two adults.</font>

332
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All you're doing is playing house.</font>

333
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not trying to be mean. 
Just stating facts.</font>

334
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She really got me there.</i></font>

335
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She didn't hold back at all.</i></font>

336
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her earnest concern for Kanata
stopped me from saying anything.</i></font>

337
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't compete with someone like that.</i></font>

338
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's head back, Ren.</font>

339
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm looking forward to 
the fireworks show tonight.</font>

340
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Next time on Turn 32: Sparks Fly.</i></font>
