<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What am I going to do with you?</font>

136
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

138
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And that's why you wanted to disappear.</font>

139
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But nothing I do is working.</font>

140
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the universe is just gonna explode?</font>

141
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you don't believe me, but...</font>

142
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not that I don't believe you.
There's just something, like, bugging me.</font>

143
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really okay
with all this, Yurinchy?</font>

144
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I dunno if you're a Bug
or a fake or whatever,</font>

145
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you've lived all this time, right?</font>

146
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been working real hard
every single day.</font>

147
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And yet...</font>

148
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm still a fake, though.</font>

149
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought about this over and over,
but the other me is the one who's real.</font>

150
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have any memories.
I'm a Bug that shouldn't exist.</font>

151
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not even human.</font>

152
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, y'know...</font>

153
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't deserve to live!</font>

154
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, what an unruly child.</font>

155
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, I guess cute li'l SQ
doesn't deserve to live either.</font>

156
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

157
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you think my name's "SQ"?</font>

158
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the 511th copy that Manan
failed to transfer her consciousness to.</font>

159
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, look at you, smarty-pants.</font>

160
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite how cute I am,
I'm still a wittle one-year-old.</font>

161
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So we're pretty much in the same boat.</font>

162
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I don't even know
if I have my own consciousness.</font>

163
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a failed version
of a poor-quality copy.</font>

164
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes me an even worse
fake than you, Yurinchy.</font>

165
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No...</font>

166
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, y'know...</font>

167
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Food tastes delicious when I eat,</font>

168
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">my heart skips a beat
when I see a hot guy,</font>

169
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it's fun when my nails turn out nice!</font>

170
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm pretty sure that means I'm alive.</font>

171
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So it doesn't matter
if I'm a fake or a copy.</font>

172
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What matters is that I'm alive.</font>

173
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm about to say something
really embarrassing,</font>

174
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so make sure you hear me loud and clear.</font>

175
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got this! Don't cry!
You silly thing!</font>

176
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girls totally fall for cuties like that.</font>

177
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">SQ...</font>

178
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>An anomalous lifeform has been
detected within the sick bay.</i></font>

182
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's something
I want to talk to you about.</font>

183
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're... a Bug?</font>

184
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

185
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if I don't do something, the universe
will be destroyed by the dual existence.</font>

186
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea things like this
could happen in these loops, too.</font>

187
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Er, sorry. I've actually only
looped a few times so far.</font>

188
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see. This Setsu still doesn't
know much about the loops.</i></font>

189
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This isn't good. I'm just going to make
them more nervous talking about this.</i></font>

190
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what's going to happen?</font>

191
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should I do?</font>

192
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll just have to do your best.</font>

193
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

194
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's one thing I know.</font>

195
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to continue on an
amazing journey through the loops</font>

196
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and help everyone—me included.</font>

197
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

198
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. You've got this.</font>

199
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Believe in yourself.</font>

200
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>An anomalous lifeform has been

201
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I repeat.</i></font>

205
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,400

207
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've recovered already?</font>

208
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This should put off the destruction
of the universe for a while.</font>

209
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But isn't this just
delaying the inevitable?</font>

210
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's important right now
is buying some time.</font>

211
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If what you said earlier is true,</font>

212
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when you restart the loop,
everyone else's memory is reset.</font>

213
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you'll have to start all over again.</font>

214
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, but...</font>

215
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before we go any further,
I want you to show me.</font>

216
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, right. I guess I promised you that.</font>

217
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh... I never thought I'd get to
study a living sample like this.</font>

218
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doubt not, fear not, and know.</font>

219
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Knowledge will save all.</font>

220
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not responding.
It's definitely attached itself to you.</font>

221
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My condolences.</font>

222
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now you know that I'm not lying, right?</font>

223
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">About the looping, and about being a Bug.</font>

224
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That does seem to be the case.</font>

225
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But then, the solution
is actually quite simple.</font>

226
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

227
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ha! Do try and use your brain for once.</font>

228
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been conflating
two distinct phenomena.</font>

229
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Bug version of you and the real you...</font>

230
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the two of you meet, it gives rise to
a dual existence, destroying the universe.</font>

231
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the result of one phenomenon.</font>

232
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But your continued existence is the
result of a different phenomenon—</font>

233
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the time loop you are currently
subjected to by the Silver Key.</font>

234
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Two separate phenomena entirely.</font>

235
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your inability to leave this loop has
nothing to do with your status as a Bug.</font>

236
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The cause is right there before you.</font>

237
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

238
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the looks of it,
your Silver Key isn't filled yet.</font>

239
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It still thirsts for information,
which means...</font>

240
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll keep returning me to whatever world
line still has information to find...</font>

241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">until I gain what it wants.</font>

242
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well? How does it feel to be entirely
at the Silver Key's beck and call?</font>

243
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sucks.</font>

244
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it hasn't been all bad.</font>

245
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got to find out a lot about all of you.</font>

246
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got to talk to everyone a lot,
and I've really come to like you all.</font>

248
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmph.</font>

249
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,720

250

254
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,980

255
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not at all.</font>

256
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,430

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh, is that so?</font>

266
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I wanted to thank you.</font>

267
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Chipie.</font>

268
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's thanks to you that everyone
on board was saved.</font>

269
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

270
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I really don't remember...</font>

271
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, the one who actually
led everyone was Setsu.</font>

272
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">According to an eyewitness,</font>

273
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you tried to protect Setsu
back then and got hurt.</font>

274
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

275
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though it doesn't seem that Setsu
realizes that you saved them either.</font>

276
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, anyway, glad you're all right.</font>

277
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It would've been a real downer
if you'd died after all that.</font>

278
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

279
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you please not tell
Setsu about this?</font>

280
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want them to worry.</font>

281
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. I'll pass that on
to the others, too.</font>

282
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, not again...</font>
