<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What...</font>

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is that thing?</font>

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Impossible!</font>

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a really powerful person, Mr. Jack.</font>

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what we must do hasn't changed.</font>

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your command, Master.</font>

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, then...</font>

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">let's stop that person!</font>

10
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is the child
with the Heroic Spirit within her body?</font>

11
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we tell you, what will you do to them?</font>

12
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course, following the rules
of the Holy Grail War...</font>

13
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will face her...</font>

14
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and slaughter her.</font>

15
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop joking—</font>

16
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you cannot answer, that is fine.</font>

17
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't get in my way.</font>

18
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If any stand in our way, bite them dead!</font>

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit!</font>

20
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is that? Hey, wait!</font>

21
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh brother.</font>

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong? What's wrong, police force?</font>

23
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in trouble if you 
don't put in more effort.</font>

24
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'd be a problem for me, as well,
if Tsubaki Kuruoka were to be murdered.</font>

25
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some sort of demonic creature?</font>

26
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah well...</font>

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is your problem?</font>

28
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you also what they 
call a "Dead Apostle"?</font>

29
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What...</font>

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is Cerberus doing?</font>

31
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The same face?</font>

32
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who...</font>

33
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are these guys?</font>

34
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ridiculous! This is...</font>

35
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There is nothing ridiculous about this.</font>

36
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm originally a slasher
who claimed to have come from Hell.</font>

37
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Being repeatedly gnawed to death</font>

38
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">by the guardian dog of 
hell is only appropriate.</font>

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To have the guardian dog
of the underworld as your subject...</font>

40
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can it be that Hades himself
has materialized?</font>

41
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O weak one...</font>

42
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Never again compare me with the fools...</font>

43
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">known as "the gods"!</font>

44
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like to pay a price
worse than death?</font>

45
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon.</font>

46
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologize for trying to probe.</font>

47
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

48
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, you do not seem to be a god.</font>

49
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you had any ties with gods,</font>

50
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could have forcibly 
connected you to karma</font>

51
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and perhaps mimic that guise of yours.</font>

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it seems that I cannot become you.</font>

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I understand your true nature.</font>

54
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Great hero who denies the gods.</font>

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'd venture to say that once,</font>

56
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">their blood flowed through 
your veins, as well.</font>

57
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I shall treat you as a human.</font>

58
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And...</font>

59
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall kill you off...</font>

60
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">as a human.</font>

61
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How about you come inside?</font>

62
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you stay out in the open
like that, they'll target you.</font>

63
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's fine! I'd like to see Mr. Ja—</font>

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Berserker's hour of triumph...</font>

65
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without using Strengthening on my vision.</font>

66
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

67
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That person wearing fur</font>

68
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">seems to not only be a Heroic Spirit
but is as strong as a Divine Spirit.</font>

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Mr. Berserker won't 
lose to anyone here!</font>

70
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What am I doing? Get it together!</i></font>

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need for intervention.</font>

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is my prey.</font>

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your job is to take custody of
and protect Tsubaki Kuruoka.</font>

74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Please don't waste the conviction
of my Master in vain.</font>

75
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weak one...</font>

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tell me your name.</font>

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No name exists for me.</font>

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O great hero,</font>

79
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">a living legend from mythology
that continues to exist with the times...</font>

80
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A being who keeps living...</font>

81
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have some reason
to harbor such determination.</font>

82
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However...</font>

83
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if you are saying you are going to deny
the authority of the divine...</font>

84
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you'll deny all doings of the gods,
evil or good, and toss them all away...</font>

85
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then your current self is a human
just as you wished.</font>

86
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a hero who has stooped
to a scoundrel and risen to a human!</font>

87
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what kind of 
great hero you are...</font>

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">no matter if you have
the power to destroy the world...</font>

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so long as your true nature is human...</font>

90
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you will be hunted
by an ordinary slasher with no power.</font>

95
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Jack the Ripper!</font>

96
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The folklore of a powerless Anti-Hero</font>

propagating terror to the entire world!</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You just can't get enough of this world!</font>

101
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,160

105
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is what humans imagine

122
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A quality piece of irony for you.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

140
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Assassin!</font>

141
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

142
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is the beautiful Assassin's body
not corrupted with my Magical Energy?</font>

143
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodness, I'm at a loss here!</font>

144
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Servants can summon man-eating fiends now?</font>

145
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Man-eating fiend," you say.</font>

146
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, those are suitable words
for my current state.</font>

147
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'll take that back.</font>

148
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem to be a good guy.</font>

149
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

150
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the second person
to say that I am a good guy.</font>

151
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see!</font>

152
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That person has a sure eye for things!</font>

153
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

154
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it looks like this isn't a situation
where we can waste time much.</font>

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry, can I trust you with Ayaka?</font>

156
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would like you to deliver her
to that church over there.</font>

157
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you going to do?</font>

158
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm concerned about that Heroic Spirit
covered in gold...</font>

159
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that murky one
was targeting the little girl, right?</font>

160
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I have to stop him first.</font>

161
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'd like you to take on
the golden Heroic Spirit.</font>

162
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will do something about that bowman.</font>

163
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

164
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understand.</font>

165
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll put my faith in you.</font>

166
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Know your place, mongrel.</font>

167
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who gave you permission
to gaze up upon my glory?</font>

168
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got permission from my heart!</font>

169
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see that you are a famous hero
that is worthy of looking up at!</font>

170
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From how you speak, you must be a king.</font>

171
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am grateful for being able
to stand here today!</font>

172
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mongrel, you think you appraised me
with those substandard eyes?</font>

173
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't need gratitude. Disappear at once.</font>

174
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Disappear? You mean from this world?</font>

175
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a funny guy!</font>

176
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You who I know not the name of...</font>

177
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though you are a man
in the shape of a demon...</font>

178
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the weak are simply hunted.</font>

179
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That arrogance...</font>

180
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You indeed are human.</font>

181
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you.</font>

182
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should give thanks to your Servant.</font>

183
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jeez...</font>

184
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're technically only 
supposed to protect Masters</font>

185
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who have abandoned the Holy Grail War.</font>

186
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sigma, what are you going to do?</font>

187
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to take this chance
to find Tsubaki Kuruoka and protect her.</font>

188
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, young lady...</font>

189
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">please come this way.</font>

190
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, okay.</font>

191
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shall go with you.</font>

192
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure?</font>

193
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought your objective
was the destruction of the Holy Grail War.</font>

194
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With my inexperience, I'd need to put
everything on the line to destroy them.</font>

195
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, right now...</font>

196
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the objective is rescuing a child, right?</font>

197
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you...</font>

198
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you go so far to save a child?</font>

199
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rationally speaking, this operation
should have no merit for you.</font>

200
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right, you are not one of faith.</font>

201
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There is no greater good
than saving a young child...</font>

202
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">whose heart has not been filled yet.</font>

203
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't get it. Though a child,
we're talking about a stranger, right?</font>

204
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I may still be inexperienced,</font>

205
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the devout do not think
about things like merit.</font>

206
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They simply hear the greater voice...</font>

207
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and choose that path.</font>

208
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are trying to save a 
child in this situation...</font>

209
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because you are devout, right?</font>

210
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could not do away with anger
against the heretics...</font>

211
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and could not become open-minded.</font>

212
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So long as my wish to save others
is mixed with my faith...</font>

213
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">my faith is nothing but arrogance
that thinks lightly of destiny.</font>

214
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But none of that matters.</font>

215
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My inexperience is no reason
to not save the young child.</font>

216
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

217
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, that's how things go.</font>

218
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one...</font>

219
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">came to save us.</font>

220
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry.</font>

221
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was a slip of the tongue.</font>

222
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could not save your young self
due to my inexperience.</font>

223
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I could not come across that situation
and could not save you.</font>

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is precisely proof
that I am still inexperienced.</font>

225
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are a Servant.</font>

226
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You existed in a different place and time.</font>

227
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no way we could have met
when I was a child.</font>

228
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The difference in time and location
is all but trivial.</font>

229
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As proof of that...</font>

230
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}you and I are standing here
right now in the same space.</font>

231
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I get it.</font>

232
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

233
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">wanted someone to save me.</font>

234
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see, I see!</font>

235
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With such a masterpiece,</font>

236
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you cause a calamity simply by
thrusting it into the ground!</font>

237
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about this wonderful ornamentation?</font>

238
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey you!</font>

239
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is amazing!</font>

240
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are all the surrounding weapons
of the same tier?</font>

241
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you have so many of them,
can you give me a few?</font>

242
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you were a fly buzzing around,</font>

243
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you turned out to 
be a shameless beggar.</font>

244
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asking to receive it for free
was rather audacious of me!</font>

245
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I could pay something equal in value,
I'd love to purchase them from you!</font>

246
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish to borrow these weapons as I please
while I fight you lot, so how about it?</font>

247
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you mouth off
such nonsense, mongrel!</font>

248
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I'm risking my 
life for this nonsense!</font>

249
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mongrel, I will allow you
to answer my question.</font>

250
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What an honor!</font>

251
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking at how you dodged 
that, I can tell.</font>

252
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've experienced something similar
in the past, haven't you?</font>

253
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

254
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was in a similar situation yesterday.</font>

255
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Though sky and earth were reversed.</font>

256
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What happened to that opponent?</font>

257
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We became friends.</font>

258
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Masters... no...</font>

259
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I mean, the contractors got along, too.</font>

260
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

261
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Despite being my friend, they are still
a softie when dealing with others.</font>

262
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

263
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It looks like...</font>

264
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to die here.</font>

265
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mongrel...</font>

266
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I acknowledge you as a seeker of truth
suitable for me to provide a trial.</font>

267
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you survive it,</font>

268
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I acknowledge you as their ally
and thus a clear enemy of mine.</font>

269
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, I'll grant you the honor to be
the muck dripping off of my prized blades.</font>

270
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should be proud of that.</font>

271
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a Holy Grail War after all.</font>

272
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once we meet, it naturally turns
into combat, I guess.</font>
