00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Time for a drink!</font>

140
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that about?!</font>

141
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rejoice!</font>

142
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm making you all members of Shocker!</font>

143
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell?!</font>

144
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No way...</font>

145
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this real?</font>

146
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Combat Girls!</font>

147
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We better hurry and save them!</font>

148
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,060

150
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You three, get outta here while you can!</font>

151
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the meantime, we'll—</font>

152
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll what, exactly?!</font>

153
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll figure something out!</font>

154
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so glad.</font>

155
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You came to save us, didn't you?</font>

156
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

157
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,970

158
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Combat Girls are Shocker combatants?!</font>

159
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Run for it!</font>

160
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey.</font>

161
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,540

165
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By turning all these idols 
into my slaves,</font>

170
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell is going on?!</font>

171
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Combat girls... 
even Junko and the others...</font>

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm dreaming, right? 
It's gotta be a dream!</font>

174
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They might come back this way. 
We better move.</font>

176
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're catching up to us!</font>

177
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Faster!</font>

178
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Dammit all!</font>

179
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:20,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For some reason, humans tend to 
become fixated on these so-called idols.</font>

180
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can use that.</font>

181
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,100

185
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want a part-time job?</font>

186
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not really hiring, though...</font>

187
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:21,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, we're kind of a small operation, 
and our only act is the Combat Girls.</font>

188
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do it.</font>

189
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is this?</font>

190
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You serve no further purpose.</font>

191
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Combat Girls, huh...</font>

192
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've gone over your material.</font>

193
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The singing's not remarkable, 
and there's just no real unique appeal.</font>

194
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but I don't think we'll be...</font>

195
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait, what?</font>

196
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You understand your jobs?</font>

197
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:08,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do whatever it takes to
 make them number one!</font>

198
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We of Shocker are superior 
to humans in every way.</font>

199
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Becoming a Shocker combatant could 
very well be supreme bliss for any human.</font>

200
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you agree?</font>

201
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, Master Bat Man.</font>

202
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Funny you can get so hungry 
when you're not even doing anything.</font>

203
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if the boys are 
done with their shift.</font>

204
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are they gonna eat before coming back?</font>

205
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they come back hungry, 
I oughta make something for them.</font>

206
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,130
