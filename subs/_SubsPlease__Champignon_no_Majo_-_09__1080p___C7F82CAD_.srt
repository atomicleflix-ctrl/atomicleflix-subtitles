00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Miss Witch was so pretty!</i></font>

132
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Today I feel like I'll be able to do the 
hard magic I struggled with in training!</i></font>

133
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It feels like my heart's sprouted wings.
 It feels like I can do anything!</i></font>

134
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shopping in the village?</font>

135
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really want me to go?</font>

136
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, you'll be doing us a favor,</font>

137
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and it'll also give us a way to evaluate 
your magic progress. A preliminary test.</font>

138
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And he'll keep an eye on you.</font>

139
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me?</font>

140
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna is always protecting you 
so maybe you didn't realize,</font>

141
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but a kid like you who can't 
really handle his magic yet</font>

142
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is an easy target for all sorts 
of demons and poison creatures.</font>

143
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you'll see some 
once you're out of the forest</font>

144
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and outside of Luna's protection.</font>

145
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demons and poison creatures?</font>

146
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Use the magic you've learned so far 
to protect yourself and the bull</font>

147
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and complete the job.</font>

148
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you can't pull that much off, well, 
you'd be abandoned anyway.</font>

149
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or if you're chicken and 
would rather be babysat here</font>

150
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while you play house in your wee 
little garden, then suit yourself.</font>

151
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'll tell you one thing. You sure 
as hell better not try to run away.</font>

152
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you do run, I'll turn 
that guy into stew.</font>

153
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Crows sure do love their stew!</font>

154
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Babysat" by Luna and "playing house"...</i></font>

155
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go. I won't try to run away.</font>

156
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will complete the job safely 
and return to this house!</font>

157
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}"BEEF STEW"</font>

158
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So he's basically just running errands.</font>

159
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah.</font>

160
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got nothing to worry 
about with me by your side.</font>

161
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Once we clear those two hills, 
we'll be in Musher Village.</font>

162
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

163
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know, if I did 
get turned into stew,</font>

164
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it'd probably be the most delicious stew 
in the world. Don't you think so, Lize?</font>

165
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Well...</font>

166
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I still don't want to get eaten,
 so you better not run away.</font>

167
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Minos, we'll have time to eat 
lunch later. Let's keep walking.</font>

168
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want some of that grass over there, too!</i></font>

169
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Minos, come on!</i></font>

170
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like tonight's dinner will 
be rotten beef stew after all.</font>

171
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Minos! Return!"</i></font>

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, let's hurry to the village.</font>

173
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can smell some really tasty 
grass along the road ahead.</font>

174
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What the hell did he just do?</font>

175
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did he use spirit language for a second?</font>

176
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, I offer you the 
blessing of the trees.</font>

177
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you!</font>

178
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it's a snail.</font>

179
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a poison creature, so be careful. 
Don't get too close, Lize.</font>

180
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poison creatures?</font>

181
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are those?</font>

182
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Living creatures that have ingested 
too much of the world's poisons</font>

183
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and were completely poisoned... 
and transformed.</font>

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some of them are turned into one
 by other poison creatures.</font>

185
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those fellows aren't demons, though. 
But you've got to learn the difference.</font>

186
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Be careful, Lize.</i></font>

187
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think this guy 
is gonna do anything.</font>

188
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just don't step in his 
poisonous slime, okay?</font>

189
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He must be in a lot of pain.</font>

190
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Luna was here, she could 
have absorbed his poison</font>

191
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and made him a little more 
comfortable, at least.</font>

192
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When Miss Witch encounters poison 
creatures, does she absorb their poison?</font>

193
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Only enough to give them a little relief.</font>

194
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She used to sprinkle 
poison-sucking spores on them,</font>

195
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:13,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but that made the mushrooms grow too big, 
even though it did take away the pain.</font>

196
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So now she puts a sheet on 
them that absorbs the poison</font>

197
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and keeps the miasma 
from spreading around.</font>

198
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, look. Those guys are wearing 
sheets that Luna gave them.</font>

199
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What now? You have a friend 
back there who wants a sheet, too?</font>

200
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm. Well, that's too bad.</font>

201
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry guys, but Luna isn't here today. 
She'll come by again, though.</font>

202
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do the sheets fit?</font>

203
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Miss Witch...</i></font>

204
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just right? Good! I'm glad to hear it.</font>

205
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll tell Luna you said so.</font>

206
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure it will make her happy.</font>

207
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Witch really is a wonderful person.</font>

208
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, of course she is. 
All of us are just crazy about her.</font>

209
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna's an incredible witch.</font>

210
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I think I'm crazy about her, too.</font>

211
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someday, I want to become 
a wonderful magician just like her.</font>

212
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah, and I'm sure you will.</i></font>

213
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It makes me really happy 
that you like Luna too, Lize.</i></font>

214
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:39,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to support her. I want to give 
her strength and bring her happiness.</i></font>

215
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I want to be at least a small 
source of joy in her life.</i></font>

216
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's hurry and get the goats 
so we can go home, okay?</font>

217
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll go wherever I have to 
in order to be there for her!</i></font>

218
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Look, Lize. There's the village!</font>

219
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We finished our shopping 
in no time. Nice job, Lize!</font>

220
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone was so friendly with you. 
They did seem a little nervous, though.</font>

221
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never had such an easy time 
shopping before. What a difference!</font>

222
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now we just have to get home.</font>

223
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's raining.</font>

224
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, the rain's poisonous, 
so remember what Luna told you.</font>

225
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pull up your hood, cover your skin,
 and don't forget your gloves.</font>

226
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Also, put the magic sheets 
we brought on the goats.</font>

227
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you, Minos?</font>

228
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I'll be all right.</font>

229
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

230
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up.</font>

231
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's a poison creature! 
What should we do, Lize?</font>

232
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lize, I shall give you 
three wishing seeds.</i></font>

233
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If there's a power you want to use 
or a desire you wish fulfilled,</i></font>

234
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>eat one of these and concentrate. 
It will amplify your magic,</i></font>

235
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and grant any wish within our power.</i></font>

236
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Now, recite your true name.</i></font>

237
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

238
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What is this power?</i></font>

239
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, I think he's in pain.</font>

240
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The goat is in danger, too!</font>

241
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, loosen it and let them down.</font>

242
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't like this. 
I really don't like this!</i></font>

243
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A huge flower?</font>

244
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The goat got scratched by the poison
 claws but it's still alive, Lize.</font>

245
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was wild, Lize! When did 
you learn that kind of magic?</font>

246
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing, Lize?</font>

247
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you waste wishing seeds 
to save a creature like that?</font>

248
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Poison monsters like that harm us. 
We hoped you'd eliminate it.</font>

249
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you in pain from the poison?</font>

250
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you after the magical 
sheet the goat was wearing?</font>

251
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have enough 
fabric to give him one.</font>

252
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need the goat's sheet 
to bandage its wounds.</font>

253
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, what are you doing?</font>

254
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

255
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You used conjuring magic? You even 
conjured one of Luna's magic sheets?</font>

256
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's amazing, Lize! 
You've gotten so much better!</font>

258
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good. It fits perfectly. 
That sheet is yours now.</font>

259
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you thinking, Lize?</font>

260
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could you use the power we lent 
you to help such an abomination?</font>

261
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm disappointed in you!</font>

262
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna talk to you.
 Think about what you did.</font>

263
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm going to learn magic on my own.</font>

264
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you for the powers 
you gave me until now.</font>

265
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're okay. Don't worry about it.</font>

266
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just stop trying to 
steal sheets from others,</font>

267
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and hurry on home.</font>

268
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm heading home now, too.</font>

269
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, are you okay?</font>

270
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Minos, can you carry this goat?</font>

271
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need Miss Witch to treat 
the poison wounds immediately.</font>

272
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have to hurry.</font>

273
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lize, can you walk? 
Do you want to ride, too?</font>

274
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I want to walk on my own two feet</font>

275
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>to go back to Miss Witch.</i></font>

276
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure Miss Witch is 
waiting for us right now.</font>

277
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Everyone in the black 
forest is waiting for us.</i></font>

278
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And I'm anxious to return to that house.</i></font>

279
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I feel like I've finally found it...</i></font>

280
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>a place that I can call home!</i></font>

281
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Luna, can you treat this goat's poison 
with your mushrooms right away?</font>

282
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mm-hmm.</font>

283
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See, aren't you glad I went with him?</font>

284
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mm-hmm.</font>

285

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, he would have been 
in big trouble without me.</font>
