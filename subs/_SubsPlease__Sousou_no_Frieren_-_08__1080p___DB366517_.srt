1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you? Visiting hours are over.</font>

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am Draht, one of Aura the 
Guillotine's executioners.</font>

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am here to kill you.</font>

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. Done pretending to negotiate?</font>

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're just getting started.</font>

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-huh.</font>

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just so you know, I'm strong.</font>

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stronger than me?</font>

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.</font>

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't seem like it to me.</font>

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not?</font>

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This fight is already over.</font>

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magical wire, huh? 
It's an interesting spell.</font>

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you saved yourself from decapitation 
by concentrating mana around your neck.</font>

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're level-headed.</font>

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A common mage would've lost her head 
without even realizing what had happened.</font>

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But this wire is among the 
strongest of demonkind's spells.</font>

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Humanity's magic doesn't 
stand a chance against it.</font>

19
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll cut through both 
your neck and your mana.</font>

20
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. I doubt I can 
do anything about this wire.</font>

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's enough to convince you you've won?</font>

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demons these days are hopeless.</font>

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They lack actual battle experience.</font>

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This mage...</i></font>

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She took my arm!</i></font>

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You bitch—</font>

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Let's talk this—</font>

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's one down.</font>

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I report this attack to the graf and kill 
the other two, surely he'll pardon me.</i></font>

30
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The guard is dead.</font>

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Like a fairy tale</i></font>

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i></font>

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Like a single passage taken from</i></font>

34
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>A journey that was too long</i></font>

35
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i></font>

36
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Across this land</i></font>

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>And the memories of the short journey</i></font>

38
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>With the hero who defeated it</i></font>

39
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:02,240
<font size="24"><b>{\an8}<font size="25"><font face="Georgia"><font color="#fefcff">Beyond Journey's End</font></font></font></b></font>

40
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>The story ends</i></font>

41
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>And the hero goes to sleep</i></font>

42
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Leaving this land with</i></font>

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,790
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Days of peace and quiet</i></font>

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>The passage of time heartlessly</i></font>

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Makes people forget</i></font>

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i></font>

47
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Begin to rust</i></font>

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Just the same</i></font>

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Your words and wishes and courage</i></font>

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Are still inside of me</i></font>

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>And they live on</i></font>

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>We chose the same path</i></font>

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>That's all it was supposed to be</i></font>

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Why is it that at some point</i></font>

55
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i></font>

56
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i></font>

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Even now</i></font>

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i></font>

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Even though you're not there</i></font>

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I know I'll be able to find it</i></font>

61
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is delicious.</font>

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My master said any town that serves 
tasty food is a good, peaceful town.</font>

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Wait!</font>

64
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must be true of this town, too.</font>

65
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Stark.</font>

66
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't have any.</font>

67
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's directly petition Graf Granat 
to release Ms. Frieren.</font>

68
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think it's only a matter of time 
until harm comes to this town.</font>

69
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should release Ms. Frieren from the 
dungeon and have her defeat the demons.</font>

70
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's our only option after all, huh?</font>

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We wouldn't stand a chance against them.</font>

72
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Especially not that Lügner guy. 
He's unbelievably strong.</font>

73
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He was only looking at Frieren.</font>

74
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even though we were standing there 
next to him with the guards,</font>

75
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">he was only looking at Frieren.</font>

76
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's because he thinks he 
can kill us at any time.</font>

77
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My hands still haven't stopped shaking.</font>

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">See? I even spilled my drink 
so it looks like I wet myself.</font>

79
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just how strong he is.</font>

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should wipe that up. Let's go.</font>

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lügner and his guys are with the graf.</font>

82
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Worst case, a fight will break out.</font>

83
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wouldn't stop the party 
of heroes from going.</font>

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right.</font>

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I lost my nerve here, I'd never 
be able to face my master again.</font>

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

87
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can keep the handkerchief.</font>

88
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

89
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter?</font>

90
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm paralyzed with fear.</font>

91
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm no longer detecting Draht's magic.</font>

92
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He must be dead.</font>

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What an idiot. He underestimated her.</font>

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Underestimated her?</font>

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We are the right-hand men of 
Lady Aura. Her executioners.</font>

96
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think we'd die from merely 
underestimating someone?</font>

97
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who is that mage?</font>

98
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry I kept you waiting.</font>

99
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The mage I captured has escaped.</font>

100
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The soldier guarding her cell was beheaded.</font>

101
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That can't be good.</font>

102
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll help you look for her.</font>

103
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Linie is skilled at locating magic—</font>

104
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, that's all right.</font>

105
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, one of your men 
seems to be missing.</font>

106
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's in the privy. He'll be back soon.</font>

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Without asking a servant for directions?</font>

108
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even I can tell she's a skilled mage.</font>

109
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she allowed my guards 
to seize her without a fight.</font>

110
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She understands the seriousness 
of killing a guard.</font>

111
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner, I'll ask you one last time.</font>

112
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is your man?</font>

113
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly.</font>

114
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That idiot Draht.</font>

115
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He ruined everything.</font>

116
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's strange, though.</font>

117
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:48,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now that violence has become the only way 
to resolve this mess, I'm overjoyed.</font>

118
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Granat, what are words?</font>

119
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do they differ from swords?</font>

120
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No matter what we use, the weak die.</font>

121
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just like this sword's former owner.</font>

122
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lügner!</font>

123
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the end, we are wild beasts.</font>

124
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. I won't kill you.</font>

125
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're going to help us remove 
this town's defensive barrier.</font>

126
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should be arriving at 
the graf's mansion soon.</font>

127
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ms. Frieren?</font>

128
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're Ms. Frieren, aren't you?</font>

129
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing here?</font>

130
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't tell me you broke out of the dungeon.</font>

131
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't have a choice.</font>

132
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Some demon named Draht 
attacked me while I was in there.</font>

133
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I defeated him,</font>

134
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but when demons die, they turn into 
mana particles and disappear.</font>

135
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you mean by that?</font>

136
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He'd already killed the dungeon guard.</font>

137
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only ones down there were a guard</font>

138
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who had been beheaded using 
magical wire and me, a mage.</font>

139
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How would you read that situation?</font>

140
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That you're a guard-killer 
who should be executed.</font>

141
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right? This is becoming a pain. 
I'm leaving town.</font>

142
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait.</font>

143
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you leave, the remaining 
demons will run wild.</font>

144
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you really going to abandon this town?</font>

145
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why don't you two defeat them?</font>

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You make it sound so easy.</font>

147
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't stand a chance against them.</font>

148
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not going to fight them 
just because they're strong?</font>

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I don't think you're 
weaker than them at all.</font>

150
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait!</font>

151
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll fight, okay? At least help us!</font>

152
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm begging you!</font>

153
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Peek.</font>

154
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, wait!</font>

155
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, Frieren!</font>

156
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't know when to give up, 
do you? Let's steel ourselves.</font>

157
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But... it's impossible...</font>

158
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be childish.</font>

159
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>About ten kilometers from town...</i></font>

160
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I sense a great deal of mana.</i></font>

161
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We're being observed.</i></font>

162
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aura the Guillotine, one of the 
Seven Sages of Destruction.</font>

163
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hate fighting powerful opponents, too.</font>

164
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All the more reason to finish this quickly.</font>

165
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should we be sneaking 
into the mansion like this?</font>

166
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you rather tell the gate guards 
that we're here to kill the peace envoys?</font>

167
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's oddly quiet.</font>

168
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love magic.</font>

169
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just as Qual, the Elder Sage of Corruption,</font>

170
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">spent most of his life 
developing a killing spell...</font>

171
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">demons dedicate the entirety of our long 
lives to researching a single kind of magic.</font>

172
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We develop our research 
daily over years and years.</font>

173
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ten years from now, our 
magics will be even greater,</font>

174
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and we will become even stronger.</font>

175
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But magic is a strange thing.</font>

176
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flamme the Legendary Mage's 
defensive barrier has prevented demons</font>

177
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">from invading and protected this town.</font>

178
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sometimes a spell cast by a genius a thousand
years ago outmatches spells of the present.</font>

179
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I despise geniuses.</font>

180
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They lack the beauty of accumulated effort.</font>

181
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Granat family has been entrusted with 
maintaining the barrier for generations.</font>

182
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:49,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you could allow us into this town, 
then there must be a way to control it.</font>

183
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Teach it to me.</font>

184
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give you some time.</font>

185
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Consider it carefully.</font>

186
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Making someone wait is an effective 
diplomatic strategy for humans as well.</font>

187
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you won't talk, then all that 
awaits you is further torture.</font>

188
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There must be a grimoire 
related to the barrier somewhere.</font>

189
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Search the bedroom. I'll search the study.</font>

190
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're just that adventurer kid 
from this afternoon.</font>

191
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought my son had come for me.</font>

192
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You look awful. 
Those demons did this to you?</font>

193
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll release you.</font>

194
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're trembling.</font>

195
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a problem?</font>

196
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. It's valiant.</font>

197
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My dead son was trembling 
before he headed off to battle, too.</font>

198
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn it. I can't cut the rope.</font>

199
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it magical?</font>

200
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about me. 
I'm done for either way.</font>

201
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Evacuating the townsfolk is more important.</font>

202
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're not gonna listen without you.</font>

203
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Granat family crest hangs from my neck.</font>

204
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Show this to the guards, 
and they'll do whatever you say.</font>

205
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And speaking so casually to me 
is a serious crime in this town, brat.</font>

206
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know. Given the circumstances, 
I'll overlook this offense.</font>

207
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now go.</font>

208
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

209
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, old man.</font>

210
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna break this 
expensive-looking chair.</font>

211
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't afford to replace it.</font>

212
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner, a rat.</font>

213
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Graf Granat, do you know him?</font>

214
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. He's one of the adventurers 
from this afternoon.</font>

215
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He must've come to petition me directly</font>

216
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without realizing the mage 
he was with escaped.</font>

217
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a stupid kid.</font>

218
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

219
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Again.</i></font>

220
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can leave, boy.</font>

221
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll let you live.</font>

222
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's doing it again.</i></font>

223
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's not even looking at me.</i></font>

224
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter? Move.</font>

225
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you get in my way, I'll kill you.</font>

226
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go ahead and try!</font>

227
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's fast.</i></font>

228
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you're only human.</font>

229
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You protected your vitals. 
Your reflexes aren't bad.</font>

230
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That said, the young are rash, 
whether they're humans or demons—</font>

231
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">thoughtless and reckless.</font>

232
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you challenged me alone. 
I commend your valor.</font>

233
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Alone?</font>

234
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. You can't detect her after all.</font>

235
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

236
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern, I created the opening you asked for.</font>

237
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner, I'm sensing a mage!</font>

238
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Impossible.</i></font>

239
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:18,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A mere human mage evaded Linie's detection?</i></font>

240
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>And this spell...</i></font>

241
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Lügner, let me handle this.</font>

242
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't.</font>

243
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Girl, what is that spell?</font>

244
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ordinary offensive magic.</font>

245
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I believe it's known as Zoltraak 
in your magic system.</font>

246
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Zoltraak?</font>

247
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be absurd.</font>

248
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Demonkind overcame Zoltraak 
half a century ago.</font>

249
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who taught you this spell?</font>

250
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're trying to buy time, aren't you?</font>

251
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I should finish you now.</font>

252
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't allow it.</font>

253
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fern!</font>

254
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The graf is gravely injured.</font>

255
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have time to fight.</font>

256
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's retreat!</font>

257
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

258
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll go after them once 
I've stopped my bleeding.</font>

259
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You kill the warrior.</font>

260
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My blood is on those two.</font>

261
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We won't lose them.</font>

262
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You needn't fight them yourself, Lord Lügner.</font>

263
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can handle the mage as well.</font>

264
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you'd been struck by that spell, 
it would've killed you.</font>

265
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That spell has been modified 
to specialize in killing demons.</font>

266
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It can hardly be called Zoltraak anymore.</font>

267
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a demon-killing spell.</font>

268
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The way that girl moved
