00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've come to invite you
to play in Candle Woods.</font>

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you ready to go?</font>

3
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

4
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please take me there now.</font>

5
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,000
<font face="Georgia" size="20"><b><font size="13">This is a story about a deranged world.</font></b></font>

6
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll be back.</i></font>

7
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll be back.</i></font>

8
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

9
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning.</font>

10
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That outfit doesn't suit you at all.</font>

11
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Same to you.</font>

12
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's been three months 
since we were last together.</font>

13
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Has it been that long?</font>

14
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are you doing?</font>

15
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't picked up any 
odd injuries, have you?</font>

16
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'm doing well.</font>

17
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There are so many of them. 
Probably mostly beginners.</font>

18
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not so. Most are regulars.</font>

19
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

20
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll probably start six hours from now.</font>

21
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have a lot of time.</font>

22
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go for a walk.</font>

23
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll wait here.</font>

24
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That wasn't a request.</font>

25
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many games is this?</font>

26
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is my sixth or seventh or eighth.</font>

27
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't reached ten yet.</font>

28
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many times have I told you? 
After completing a game—</font>

29
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Record what happened.</font>

30
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does it matter? I'm doing well.</font>

31
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you?</font>

32
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you completed 99 games?</font>

33
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm still only at 96.</font>

34
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I haven't played since the pool.</font>

35
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're taking your time.</font>

36
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With four more to go,
I want to be careful.</font>

37
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's that?</font>

38
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why is it so beat-up?</font>

39
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the explainer.</font>

40
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We thought there might 
be an item hidden in it.</font>

41
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't you get in trouble 
with the game runners?</font>

42
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would've left a turtle or wolf alone, 
but it's a raccoon dog.</font>

43
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's acceptable to break raccoon dogs?</font>

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rabbits beat raccoon dogs, 
like in "Kachi-Kachi Mountain."</font>

45
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kachi-Kachi...?</font>

46
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't heard of it?</font>

47
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have.</font>

48
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

49
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're playing hide-and-seek this time.</font>

50
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we rabbits survive for a week, we win.</font>

51
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A stump wins if they kill 
at least five rabbits.</font>

52
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The raccoon dog didn't mention it,</font>

53
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but the stumps were probably 
given some kind of equipment.</font>

54
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Rabbits and stumps.</font>

55
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's an odd combination.</font>

56
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't know that story, either?</font>

57
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do. I know that one. Really.</font>

58
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"The Rabbit and the Stump," right? Yeah.</font>

59
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're a smart student.</font>

60
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, rabbits...</font>

61
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are killed by stumps.</font>

62
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll be back.</i></font>

63
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

64
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning...</font>

65
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello.</font>

66
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Moegi.</font>

67
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meet you.</font>

68
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What does she mean by that?</font>

69
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows?</font>

70
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, am I the last one?</font>

71
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it this time?</font>

72
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An escape game? A survival game?</font>

73
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was there a rules explanation?</font>

74
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

75
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was there?</font>

76
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? I don't know.</font>

77
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this everyone's first time?</font>

78
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you not know why you're here?</font>

79
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

80
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Moegi-san, you're a veteran, right?</font>

81
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you know what this is?</font>

82
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Players—rather, the stump team.</font>

83
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Welcome to Candle Woods.</font>

84
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arm yourselves.</font>

85
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You will be hunting rabbits.</font>

86
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're drinking that?</font>

87
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be going the whole week 
without eating or drinking?</font>

88
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There must be food stored somewhere.</font>

89
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never played such a 
large-scale game before.</font>

90
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you nervous?</font>

91
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I feel like I always do.</font>

92
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:39,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm surprised this many idiots are willing
to risk their lives for a few million.</font>

93
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're one to talk.</font>

94
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe we are idiots.</font>

95
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you play these games?</font>

96
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>

97
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do I play?</font>

98
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't ask me.</font>

99
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ninety-nine games, huh?</font>

100
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no trophy or cash prize, right?</font>

101
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nope. It'd just be the new record.</font>

102
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Actually, there's no 
guarantee it would be.</font>

103
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've just heard 98 consecutive 
wins is the record.</font>

104
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't believe you're
counting on a rumor.</font>

105
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll understand eventually.</font>

106
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's come up with a strategy.</font>

107
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Against ranged weapons, 
we'll split up and take it slow.</font>

108
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Against melee weapons...</font>

109
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Slacking off?</font>

110
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sumiyaka-san.</font>

111
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're as unfriendly as ever, huh?</font>

112
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you feel terrible to hug.</font>

113
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should eat better food. 
You're making good money.</font>

114
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shouldn't you be over there?</font>

115
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing for a mere 29-game 
veteran to do over there.</font>

116
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The rabbits' leader is a 95-game veteran.</font>

117
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We could sleep through this game and win.</font>

118
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's really amazing, isn't she?</font>

119
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Amazing doesn't 
begin to describe her.</font>

120
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you have any idea what 
the odds are of beating 95 games?</font>

121
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Avoid acting on your own.</font>

122
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Always act and strike in 
groups of at least three.</font>

123
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it one in 95?</font>

124
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot.</font>

125
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I calculated it once.</font>

126
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The survival rate is 70%.</font>

127
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Multiply that 95 times, 
and you get one in 500 trillion.</font>

128
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

129
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do the math once you're home.</font>

130
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No one on Earth can compare to her.</font>

131
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your mentor is humanity's 
greatest genius of all time.</font>

132
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd better give her 
the respect she deserves.</font>

133
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}There's no need to push ourselves.</font>

134
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}We'll steal our opponents' weapons 
and build up our strength.</font>

135
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I do.</font>

136
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you?</font>

137
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's right.</font>

138
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna go.</font>

139
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay.</font>

140
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kill her.</font>

141
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is practice.</font>

142
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want all of you to kill her.</font>

143
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your name?</font>

144
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your player name.</font>

145
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Kabane.</font>

146
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kabane-san. Kill her.</font>

147
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But she's still alive.</font>

148
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, she is. So kill her.</font>

149
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Twice per person—that's the quota.</font>

150
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stab through to at least 
the center of the blade.</font>

151
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ideally, aim for a vital point.</font>

152
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why aren't you picking it up?</font>

153
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, um... th-the order...</font>

154
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

155
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-Why am I first?</font>

156
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not fair unless we decide
with rock-paper-scissors—</font>

157
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't matter who's first!</font>

158
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm saying you'll all die
unless you stab her!</font>

159
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're not just hunting
rabbits in this game.</font>

160
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're trying to kill each other.</font>

161
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's kill or be killed!</font>

162
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry!</font>

163
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Please don't be angry.</font>

164
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If a stump dies, that leaves 
more spots for survivors.</font>

165
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So the rabbits will try to kill us, too.</font>

166
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unless you shape up,
they'll take your weapons and kill you.</font>

167
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't just affect you, either.</font>

168
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It'll be a huge loss for the whole team.</font>

169
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For all of us to survive,
we need your help.</font>

170
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't hesitate.</font>

171
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm quitting.</font>

172
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't know it was like this.</font>

173
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll drop out, so please forgive me.</font>

174
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please.</font>

175
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please. Please. Please.</font>

176
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please...</font>

177
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah.</font>

178
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah.</font>

179
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah?</font>

180
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's your name?</font>

181
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Next.</font>

182
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Moegi-san.</font>

183
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

184
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What should we do now?</font>

185
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Grab all the weapons and 
make sure everyone is armed.</font>

186
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll come up with a strategy. 
Don't come in.</font>

187
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her head felt heavy.</i></font>

188
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I considered putting a hole in it 
to make it lighter for her.</i></font>

189
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But I thought she'd done well this time.</i></font>

190
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She deserves credit for that.</i></font>

191
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A strong player who 
doesn't care how she looks.</i></font>

192
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I know she would've done the same.</i></font>

193
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She deserves credit for acting that 
way for the last half hour or so.</i></font>

194
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Because that was her goal.</i></font>

195
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Eventually, she'd be able to 
act that way all the time.</i></font>

196
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Moegi was willing to give 
her life to achieve that goal.</i></font>

197
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A strong player who doesn't hesitate.</i></font>

198
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A strong person who 
doesn't care how she looks.</i></font>

199
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She'd keep coming back from the dead</i></font>

200
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>until she achieved it.</i></font>
