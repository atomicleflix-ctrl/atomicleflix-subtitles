00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I left the party. 
It was getting to be a real drag.</font>

141
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Curse you,</font>

142
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Jean Inteige!</font>

143
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flum's parents left her in my hands!</font>

144
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Ottilie came to pick me up 
when I was named a hero.</i></font>

145
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She escorted me on the several-day trip 
from my home village to the capital.</i></font>

146
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know what to say.</font>

147
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, don't worry about me.</font>

148
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm doing okay.</font>

149
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so?</font>

150
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm relieved to see you're doing well.</font>

151
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, who is that girl 
you brought here, Flum?</font>

152
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, her?</font>

153
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was a hostage taken by Dein.</font>

154
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She says she has amnesia.</font>

155
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something must've happened to her.</font>

156
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it okay if she stays 
with us for a while?</font>

157
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm basically a freeloader. 
You don't need my permission.</font>

158
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

159
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would be very grateful.</font>

160
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was corruption in the royal army 
that led to this in the first place.</font>

161
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm truly sorry for causing you 
so much trouble.</font>

162
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be. This is all Dein's fault.</font>

163
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He blackmailed the West District guards 
using evidence of their misdeeds.</font>

164
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suppose he's not a Phineas for nothing.</font>

165
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A Phineas?</font>

166
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you didn't know?</font>

167
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's the oldest son of House Phineas, 
a ruined noble family.</font>

168
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Dein's a former noble?!</font>

169
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

170
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He has the knowledge, smarts, and cunning 
to set him apart from the common thugs.</font>

171
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how he built his influence 
in the West District.</font>

172
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As the conflict between the Church 
and the royal army grows more intense,</font>

173
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we heard that the West District guard 
was under his influence.</font>

174
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milady decided that the matter 
must be dealt with at once.</font>

175
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Milady"?</font>

176
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-oh.</font>

177
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:05,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean none other than my dear Henriette, 
General of the Royal Army! Squee!</font>

178
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why, I can already bring to mind her 
lovely legs! The back of her knees!</font>

179
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her slender fingers! The webbing 
between her index and middle!</font>

180
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her nape! The back of her ears!</font>

181
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her no*****s! Her lips!</font>

182
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:22,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, don't gaze at me 
with those beautiful eyes!</font>

183
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh... she kinda let herself go.</font>

184
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is she always like this?</font>

185
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah.</font>

186
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She got like this a bunch of times 
on our way to the capital, too.</font>

187
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like quite the ordeal.</font>

188
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't say that.</font>

189
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Milady's busy enough as it is.</font>

190
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why'd that stupid Dein 
have to trouble her even more?</font>

191
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is why I never get the chance 
to have a leisurely chat with her!</font>

192
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She died.</font>

193
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,580
<font size="22"><b>{\an8}WANTED
FLUM THE MURDERER!!</b></font>

194
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got super worried when I saw this, 
so I came to check on ya.</font>

195
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Sara.</font>

196
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who's this girl?</font>

197
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, this is Sara, a nun 
at the Central District church.</font>

198
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And this is Ottilie, 
Lieutenant General of the Royal Army.</font>

199
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to meetcha.</font>

200
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The pleasure's all mine.</font>

201
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal army... and the Church?</font>

202
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A beast?</font>

203
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

204
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We ran into it by the mountains 
in a village called Anichidey.</font>

205
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yep! It also had an abandoned 
Church research facility!</font>

206
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Church has a bunch of research teams. 
It must've been one of them.</font>

207
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That reminds me.</font>

208
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Remember how we got attacked 
by a lady with a spiral face there?</font>

209
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A spiral face?</font>

210
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That lady was wearing the same clothes 
as the kids in the Church's orphanage.</font>

211
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?</font>

212
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Does that mean they're 
experimenting on orphans?</font>

213
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">An all-too-plausible possibility.</font>

214
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's unacceptable.</font>

215
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I nearly forgot!</font>

216
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weren't you wielding a cursed sword?</font>

217
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yes. That's what Reversal does.</font>

218
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reversal?</font>

219
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. It seems I can reverse 
the effects of curses.</font>

220
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had no idea that rare affinity 
could be used that way.</font>

221
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only found out recently myself.</font>

222
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If we'd realized it on our journey, 
you wouldn't have been sold into slavery.</font>

223
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I'd done more.</font>

224
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't blame yourself. Even I didn't know.</font>

225
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

226
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you were chosen for the party</font>

227
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">because the Church knew how effective 
Reversal could be? Was that it?</font>

228
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Otherwise, it'd make no sense for her 
to be chosen with all zeroes for stats.</font>

229
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:58,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if the Church just wanted her power, 
they could've simply abducted her.</font>

230
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why was I chosen 
to go fight the Demon Lord?</font>

231
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is my worth?</font>

232
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Master.</font>

233
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks, Milkit.</font>

234
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way,</font>

235
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">there's no doubt the Church 
is involved in all this.</font>

236
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always thought the Church's 
clandestine research</font>

237
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">was for the purpose of 
invading the Demon Realm again.</font>

238
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But considering Flum's power, 
perhaps they have a different objective.</font>

239
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Either way, I'm happy to know 
there are others out there</font>

240
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">who suspect the Church of wrongdoing.</font>

241
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could we continue to meet like this 
and share information?</font>

242
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course.</font>

243
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll help out, too.</font>

244
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The more, the merrier.</font>

245
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We have an accord, then.</font>

246
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come to the royal castle barracks 
if you ever need help.</font>

247
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will.</font>

248
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's so good having Ottilie on our team.</font>

249
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want you to take 
any more risks, Master.</font>

250
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must have put your life in danger 
to fight Dein today, too.</font>

251
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, it was nothing to worry about.</font>

252
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really?</font>

253
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, er...</font>

254
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't lie to you, Milkit.</font>

255
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you <i>were</i> in danger.</font>

256
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm glad you're all right, though.</font>

257
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you were waiting for me.</font>

258
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I had to come home no matter what.</font>

259
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm happy to hear it.</font>

260
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I'm happy to hear you say that.</font>

261
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She must've been really exhausted.</font>

262
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah, that's the same outfit 
as the Church's orphanage.</i></font>

263
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Should we really be taking 
those off without asking?</font>

264
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Something's bothering me.</font>

265
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Magical tattoos?</font>

266
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Did she... run away 
from a research facility?</i></font>

267
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll look after her.</font>

268
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I swear I'll make 'em pay!</font>

269
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is that Phil? Or maybe...</i></font>

270
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kahnis!</font>

271
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,310
