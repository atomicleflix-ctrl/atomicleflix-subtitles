27
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's going on?</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain Pan!</font>

29
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's a message from the fire station!</font>

30
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Infernals are appearing in huge numbers!</font>

31

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm docking your pay.</font>

32
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,930

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I really will change jobs.</font>

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That conversation is over.</font>

36
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More importantly, I received an 
urgent message from headquarters.</font>

37
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it this time?</font>

38
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For unknown reasons, 
Amaterasu has ceased functioning.</font>

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And Nataku Son, whom the research 
department was looking after,</font>

40
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">has apparently vanished.</font>

00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nataku-kun is gone?</font>

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's bad.</font>

43
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He is a precious weakling 
worthy of tormenting.</font>

44
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For now, we're heading 
back to headquarters.</font>

45
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry up and start the car.</font>

46
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Flying would be faster.</font>

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My suit would get dirty.</font>

48
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Think of a way to get 
me there quickly by car.</font>

49
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Understood.</font>

50
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no good. I can't 
find either one of them.</font>

51
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They might be hiding somewhere.</font>

52
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shinra's a pillar, so that's one thing,
but why is Iris gone, too?</font>

53
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The reason is simple.</font>

54
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sister Iris must be the final pillar,
the eighth one.</font>

55
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then that flame earlier really was...</font>

56
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And at Fuchu, when Dragon's 
attack was blocked...</font>

57
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sister did that?</font>

58
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And...</font>

59
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">this blackout probably happened because</font>

60
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the first pillar's disappearance caused 
Amaterasu to stop functioning.</font>

61
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If so, Shinra-kun, the sister, and the 
pillars vanishing must be connected.</font>

62
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The question is, where have they all gone?</font>

63
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Adolla.</font>

64
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're...</font>

65
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They went to Adolla. Every second counts.</font>

66
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The Great Cataclysm has 
entered the final phase.</font>

67
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have time to argue here.</font>

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would we trust you?!</font>

69
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You show up out of nowhere 
and say all this?!</font>

70
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Captain Huo Yan lost his 
right arm to your arrows!</font>

71
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there's Lieutenant Rekka, too!</font>

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, when the fate of the 
world hangs in the balance,</font>

73
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what is the worth of one arm?</font>

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is not the time for such grievances.</font>

75
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You little—</font>

76
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it that you know?</font>

77
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Arrow.</font>

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If my brother can become 
this world's hero,</font>

79
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then the Great Cataclysm 
may yet be stopped.</font>

80
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If that fails, all of the pillars 
will likely disappear to Adolla.</font>

81
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander, if I lose you, then my duty...</font>

82
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen to me, Arrow.</font>

83
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not abandon hope.</font>

84
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As long as my brother exists,</font>

85
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the endpoint of humanity's 
collective unconscious</font>

86
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is not death.</font>

87
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir!</font>

88
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just as the fourth and eighth 
pillar have disappeared,</font>

89
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the third pillar vanished, too.</font>

90
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Protecting Commander Sho 
Kusakabe is my mission.</font>

91
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what can we do 
under these conditions?</font>

92
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hope still remains.</font>

93
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We merely need to stop the switch 
that triggers the Great Cataclysm.</font>

94
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where is this switch?</font>

95
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a guess as to where 
the switch might be.</font>

100
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,410

105
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Those are good words.</font>

106
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,600

You come, too!</font>

116
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,190

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you see the number of 
Infernals on your way here?</font>

118
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There were quite a lot of them.</font>

119
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What could be more important 
than laying Infernals to rest?</font>

120
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The White Clad are attacking

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the White Clad will attack Amaterasu.</font>

123
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So they've finally made it this far, huh?</font>

124
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,250

125
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,840
