92
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,280

93
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,290

94
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's sweet!</font>

95
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The pink flowers are sugar,</i></font>

109
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess you're not going to let me

120
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,960

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,480

267
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>There!</i></font>

268
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tiara?</font>

269
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I made this with the fairies earlier.</font>

270
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I love Prince Aqua,</font>

271
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I want to work with the forest fairies 
to make this kingdom more prosperous.</font>

272
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I split this in half.</font>

273
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If the two kings work together, 
this kingdom can prosper even more.</i></font>

274
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That won't be enough.</font>

275
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed.</font>

276
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

277
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I told you not to touch my fiancée.</font>

278
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'll support this kingdom 
by my side, won't you?</font>

279
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here. Eat.</font>

280
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Sweet.</i></font>

281
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Eat this, too.</font>

282
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,690

283
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It makes them taste doubly sweet.</i></font>

284
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

285
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's good.</font>

286
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They were fighting just moments ago.</i></font>

287
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Maybe these two have more 
in common than I thought?</i></font>

288
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's like Tiara is the king!</font>

289
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's true! I feel as if I have 
two kings at my service now!</i></font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You really are great, Tiara.</font>

291
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Th-This is not a laughing matter!</font>

292
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've begun to look forward to 
this kingdom's future a bit.</i></font>
