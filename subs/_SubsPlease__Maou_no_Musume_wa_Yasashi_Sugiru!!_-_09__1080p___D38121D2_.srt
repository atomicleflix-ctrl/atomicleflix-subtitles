102
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,650

126
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many special trials did you do?</font>

127
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,930

129
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, Jahi? Has there

130
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,510

134
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,720

Doux has changed as well.</font>

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,870

were the special trials?</font>

136
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What did you think of them?</font>

137
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, well...</font>

138
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I wanted to be

139
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Doux!</font>

140
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that so, Doux?</font>

141
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah!</font>

142
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that great, Jahi?</font>

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes!</font>

144
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All of my troubles until now 
have finally become worth it.</font>

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now I'll be able to face my father.</font>

146
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because everyone was so nice!</font>

147
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

148
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to take care of my

149

153
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux wants to be a demon

for you at ten in the great hall.</font>

270
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}His Majesty will do his opening speech, 
then the guests will say a few words,</font>

271
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}followed by the executive members,</font>

272
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's finally the day of 
my birthday celebration.</i></font>

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}and then we will have you say 
a few words, Lord Zareth.</font>

274
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Thank goodness. I won't be able
to keep it together much longer.</i></font>

275
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Then we will head over 
to the great dining hall</font>

276
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}to give a toast
 and then enjoy the banquet.</font>

277
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Once the festivities are 
over, I'll go home at once...</i></font>

278
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come in.</font>

279
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good morning, Pawpaw.</font>

280
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pawpaw, um...</font>

281
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux has something she 
wants to show you today.</font>

282
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please come to my room...</font>

283
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you been doing what 
I've told you to do?</font>

284
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not yet.</font>

285
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But, um...</font>

286
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you still going to 
come up with excuses?</font>

287
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you wish to speak with me,</font>

288
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you must do everything I've 
ordered you to do first.</font>

289
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have better things to do 
than play house with you.</font>

290
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let us go, Jahi.</font>

291
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yes, but...</font>

292
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Are you going to 
talk back to me, as well?</font>

293
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">L-Lady Doux!</font>

294
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do not chase after her!</font>

295
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

296
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, sir.</font>

297
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's Lord Zareth...</font>

298
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's really intense.</font>

299
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's killing everyone's appetite...</font>

300
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard that he'll kill 
you if you make him angry.</font>

301
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's Doux?</font>

302
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?! Well, um...</font>

303
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She hates me! Doux hates me!</i></font>

304
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, why am I lamenting?</i></font>

305
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was prepared for this to happen!</i></font>

306
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am going to the bathroom.</font>

307
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Zareth!</font>

308
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leave me be.</font>

309
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is how it should be.</i></font>

310
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So that she can cast aside her 
kindness and survive as a demon...</i></font>

311
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I had to set Doux on the right path.</i></font>

312
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is... Doux's room.</font>

313
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux?</font>

314
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAWPAW!!</font>

315
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAWPAW!!</font>

316
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux?</font>

317
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAWPAW!!</font>

318
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you make all of this?</font>

319
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup...</font>

320
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to surprise you because 
it's your birthday today, Pawpaw.</font>

321
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I made this and didn't 
even tell Papa or Big Sister Jahi.</font>

322
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I'll make sure to 
clean all this up, too...</font>

323
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't go on walks anymore</font>

324
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and I won't... go see 
the humans as much...</font>

325
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

326
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanna talk with you more, Pawpaw.</font>

327
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doux!</font>

328
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's okay! It's okay, Doux!</font>

329
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can change at your own pace 
without having anyone hold you down!</font>

330
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please forgive me, Doux!</font>

331
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... I was wrong.</font>

332
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never received a gift 
that made me so happy before!</font>

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This goes here.</font>

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Like this?</font>

335
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup! I'll put one on you, too, Pawpaw!</font>

336
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! Both of you, come help us!</font>

337
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We'll have the rest of my birthday 
celebration in Doux's room!</font>

338
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Having a grandchild is wonderful!</i></font>
