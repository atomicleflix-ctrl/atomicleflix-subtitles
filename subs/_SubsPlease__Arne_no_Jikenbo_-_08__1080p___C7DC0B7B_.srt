00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Guten Abend.</font>

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ladies and gentlemen, Lynn Reinweiß 
here to summarize what happened</font>

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">in the previous episode 
of <i>The Casebook of Arne</i>.</font>

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After Little Red Phantom Thief 
threatened to steal the Blue Heart,</font>

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the latest work by the jeweler Mr. Yelle,</font>

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the director of the art museum 
went to Lord Arne for protection.</font>

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, both the Blue Heart 
and Mr. Yelle himself had disappeared.</font>

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We then received requests to find 
three other people who had gone missing.</font>

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After that, I learned that Mr. Yelle had made
 the Blue Heart for someone special,</font>

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he'd also commissioned a portrait 
that he never went to pick up.</font>

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then, with Mr. Yelle's whereabouts
 still unknown, Lord Arne faced off</font>

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">against Little Red Phantom Thief
 at the museum!</font>

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, her true goal was merely 
to deliver another warning—</font>

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before Lord Vampire gets a chance, 
I will find the missing Mr. Yelle,</font>

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and claim the Blue Heart for myself!</font>

16
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then, something even <i>more</i> terrifying 
happened at the art museum!</font>

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I have located the missing humans.</i></font>

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Huh?</i></font>

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Or more accurately, I have located 
the corpses of the missing humans.</i></font>

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will the Arne Detective Agency 
be able to solve this mystery?!</font>

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? This intro is too long?</font>

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What—</font>

23
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}THE CASEBOOK OF ARNE</font>

24
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}PART 8: DESIRE AND LOVE
MAKE ALL BURDENS LIGHTER</font>

25
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The statues, the pride of our 
collection, are p-people's corpses?</font>

26
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I really put corpses on display?</font>

27
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir?</font>

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In order to make them incomplete,</font>

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the killer deliberately
 cut off their heads.</font>

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's some twisted taste.</font>

31
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Taking lives for the sake 
of art is unforgivable!</font>

32
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The question is, who were they
 in the first place?</font>

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can't you already take a stab 
at that, Lynn Reinweiß?</font>

34
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

35
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh no! They're the missing boyfriends?</font>

36
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can a corpse be art? Of course it can.</font>

37
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Art is art because art transcends ethics!</font>

38
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is no time for laughter.</font>

39
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Director, please pull yourself together.</font>

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Art is the <i>f#$%¬@> s#@%</i>!</font>

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aw, yeah!</font>

42
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Director!</font>

43
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-What was I just doing?</font>

44
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please tell us the name of the sculptor
 who made these statues.</font>

45
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The sculptor?</font>

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, of course. Let's see.</font>

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Frau Silke? Gusteinstraße 3-B?</font>

48
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go there now.</font>

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it, Lynn Reinweiß.</font>

50
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

51
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How many corpses do you see?</font>

52
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One, two, three, four...</font>

53
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's one too many.</font>

54
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! Mr. Yelle?</font>

55
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's possible.</font>

56
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it cannot be! 
Mr. Yelle was turned into one of these?</font>

57
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sir!</font>

58
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Mr. Yelle.</font>

59
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Well then, Lynn Rein—</font>

60
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne, please follow up on this clue
 and try to find Mr. Yelle.</font>

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go visit the sculptor.</font>

62
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This must be the place.</font>

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait! Wait a second.</font>

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong?</font>

65
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you ring that, she might run.</font>

66
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, gotcha.</font>

67
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yup, pretty darn twisted.</font>

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It appears she is indeed the killer.</font>

69
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How are we going 
to explain this to our clients?</font>

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is so cruel!</font>

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, do I have guests?</font>

72
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you here to see me? 
Or to see my art perhaps?</font>

73
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't they wonderful?</font>

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if you put all of the greatest 
artists in history together,</font>

75
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">they couldn't produce 
anything close to my work.</font>

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leaving off one part of the body 
allows the viewer of the work</font>

77
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to imagine whatever kind 
of perfect form they choose.</font>

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that isn't all.</font>

79
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Artists sacrifice their own vitality 
to bring their work to life,</font>

80
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but my works are life itself.</font>

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think that's wonderful? 
There is no greater art than life itself.</font>

82
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

83
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Medusa! Don't look into her eyes 
or you'll be turned to stone!</font>

84
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you turn Mr. Yelle to stone, too?</font>

85
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows? I'm only interested
in their looks, after all.</font>

86
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this "Yelle" was beautiful enough, 
he could very well be up there.</font>

87
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's awful.</font>

88
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know what? You're adorable.</font>

89
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In fact, the three of you are so cute, 
I'll turn you <i>all</i> into a work of art.</font>

90
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take care of this. You have to run.</font>

91
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But...</font>

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Get moving, kid! Uh...</font>

93
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hurry!</font>

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amy!</font>

95
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You have to run!</font>

96
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what about Amy?</font>

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's too late! Run!</font>

98
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She let herself get turned 
to stone to save you.</font>

99
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A bluebell?</font>

100
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Mr. Yelle's talents have truly 
been flourishing recently.</i></font>

101
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Bluebell"? Are you sure he didn't
 actually say "Blue Heart"?</font>

102
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He definitely said "bell."</font>

103
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A bluebell.</font>

104
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zisye?</font>

105
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Lynn.</font>

106
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nach, are we going to be all right?</font>

107
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nach!</font>

108
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you can't speak because
 Lord Arne is too far away.</font>

109
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Turn around and look at me, darling.</font>

110
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll turn you into a work of art 
that everyone will find beautiful!</font>

111
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lynn, turn at the next corner.</font>

112
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zisye!</font>

113
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Go straight, then turn left 
down the next alley.</font>

114
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Take the next right. 
Now left at this corner.</font>

115
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh no.</font>

116
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's no use hiding.</font>

117
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Found your hiding spot? No, not yet.</font>

118
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Found your hiding spot?</font>

119
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Found your hiding spot?</font>

120
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm not that naive.</font>

121
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course not.</font>

122
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

123
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You'd never fall for a trap like this.</font>

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha—</font>

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lynn.</font>

126
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The jeweler isn't among them.</font>

127
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have to go and tell 
Lord Arne about Medusa.</font>

128
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know just where to find him.</font>

129
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You sure took your time, Lord Vampire.</font>

130
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Game over. It appears
 I have defeated you.</font>

131
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or is that another fake?</font>

132
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's a pity you have no eye 
for marvelous things, Lord Vampire.</font>

133
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is, without a doubt,
 the true Blue Heart.</font>

134
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What proof do you have that it's real?</font>

135
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why would I need proof?</font>

136
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're wondering why I have it?
I took it directly from Mr. Yelle himself.</font>

137
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne!</font>

138
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Little Red Phantom Thief. 
I didn't realize you were here.</font>

139
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is a disaster. I forgot to bring
 my Lord Arne cheer merch.</font>

140
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the most important of all:
 the tracksuit.</font>

141
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's the most important piece?</font>

142
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that thing you're holding
 the Blue Heart?</font>

143
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, this is the marvelous
 Blue Heart itself.</font>

144
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She said she got it from Mr. Yelle.</font>

145
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good. That must mean he's all right.</font>

146
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't be so sure.</font>

147
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

148
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yelle said he was making the Blue Heart
 for someone special, correct?</font>

149
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes.</font>

150
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really think that means <i>her</i>?</font>

151
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How dare you be so rude 
to someone as marvelous as I.</font>

152
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yelle was making it for his lover.</font>

153
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">During my investigations, 
I didn't find anything about a lover.</font>

154
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He had one.</font>

155
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A lover who was able to lavish him 
with startling artistic prowess.</font>

156
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sounds like something 
we heard about earlier.</font>

157
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ah, that thing before, yeah!
The crest at the art museum.</font>

158
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}The leannán sídhe.</font>

159
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The leannán sídhe.</font>

160
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The leannán sídhe is the fairy 
that's the symbol of this city, right?</font>

161
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The director explained it to us.</font>

162
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A leannán sídhe grants talent 
to the artists she loves,</font>

163
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then robs them of their lives.</font>

164
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their lives?</font>

165
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm honestly impressed
you pieced that all together,</font>

166
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Vampire, Lady Lynn, Lady Amy,</font>

167
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and Lord Plushie.</font>

168
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who are you calling a "plushie"?</font>

169
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You obviously, plushie.</font>

170
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take you to him.</font>

171
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew he would be here.</font>

172
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mr. Yelle.</font>

173
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Vampire, how did you know
 you would find him here?</font>

174
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you asking me 
when you got here first?</font>

175
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zisye told me that 
when you visited his home,</font>

176
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">you uttered the word "bluebell," 
so I came to take a look.</font>

177
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is the only nearby place like this.</font>

178
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A hill covered in blossoming bluebells.</font>

179
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Leannán sídhe are said to reside
 on flower-covered hills.</font>

180
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:25,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This very hill might be where 
the leannán sídhe and Mr. Yelle first met.</font>

181
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then, they fell in love.</font>

182
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A little to your left, please.</i></font>

183
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No, I think I'm fine here.</i></font>

184
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They must have been very happy 
during their time together.</font>

185
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:33,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Happy? The human only wanted talent 
and the fairy only wanted a life.</font>

186
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was a transactional relationship,
 defined by desire.</font>

187
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It's done. It's finally done.</i></font>

188
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Leannán sídhe, take a look. Leannán...</i></font>

189
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Leannán sídhe?</i></font>

190
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Love is fleeting.</font>

191
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're giving it back?</font>

192
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was able to find it before anyone else, 
so I believe I succeeded anyway.</font>

193
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That must mean I can do whatever 
I want with the Blue Heart now.</font>

194
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't you think?</font>

195
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lord Arne.</font>

196
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, wasn't that the museum's request?</font>

197
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the Arne Detective Agency
 to protect the Blue Heart?</font>

198
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I guess it was.</font>

199
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it wasn't, Arne.</font>

200
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Zisye?</font>

201
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The museum asked you to protect the 
Blue Heart from Little Red Phantom Thief.</font>

202
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But now that the Blue Heart is back 
in the hands of its rightful owner,</font>

203
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">what is there to protect it from?</font>

204
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and your stupid semantics.</font>

205
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, the moon tonight 
is exceptionally beautiful.</font>

206
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In honor of that moon, I suppose I could 
play along with your stupid charade.</font>

207
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your painting has been delivered.</font>

208
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish Lord Arne could've
 attended this with us.</font>

209
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a chance. Zwei has 
no interest in places like this.</font>

210
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I never imagined the fourth victim 
would be one of the museum's guests.</font>

211
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I pray you can rest in peace.</font>

212
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I imagine you're not thrilled 
that we're the ones to see you off,</font>

213
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I guess we're better than no one.</font>

214
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This was such a sad case.</font>

215
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was the first one Lord Arne
 left me in charge of,</font>

216
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I wanted to be able to celebrate...</font>

217
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But without your hard work, Lynn, 
they would've remained statues forever,</font>

218
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and never been returned 
to their loved ones.</font>

219
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The clients wouldn't have been able
 to move on with their lives.</font>

220
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They too would've 
become living corpses.</font>

221
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Neat. Kinda like zombies? Ouch!</font>

222
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, I deserved that, 
but I'm still pissed about it.</font>

223
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But what about you? You sure you didn't 
stick the heads on the wrong bodies?</font>

224
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a chance.</font>

225
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right. Amy really put 
her heart into her work for us.</font>

226
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I have a request.</i></font>

227
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What kind of request?</i></font>

228
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'd like you to take the heads 
and bodies of Medusa's victims,</i></font>

229
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and carefully put them back together.</i></font>

230
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>When you see a lover for the last time
 before being separated forever,</i></font>

231
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't think you ever forget 
how they looked. So please...</i></font>

232
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I did my very best for Lynn's sake.</font>

233
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good job, me.</font>

234
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sheesh.</font>

235
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That night...</i></font>

236
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm sure I saw the leannán sídhe
among the flowers.</i></font>

239
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,680

240
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm so bored.</font>

241
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why aren't they back yet?</font>

242
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just relax. How about 
some nice chamomile tea?</font>
