00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You were invited, as well?</font>

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I'm technically a distant
relative of the royal family,</font>

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I'm often invited to 
these kinds of events.</font>

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even though he acts a bit like a playboy, 
he's surprisingly well-mannered.</i></font>

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So he's actually of royal blood...</i></font>

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yet he's being treated
 like a mere retainer.</i></font>

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, the chances of me inheriting 
the throne are practically zero.</font>

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, please, no need to be formal with me.</font>

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seichiro?</font>

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My, I hardly recognized you.</font>

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Prime Minister Karvada.</font>

 considerably because of you. Thank you.</font>

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, Your Excellency and the 
other high-ranking officials</font>

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">are the ones who worked hard 
to truly make it happen.</font>

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's just leave it at that, then.</font>

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, you look quite well today.</font>

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That outfit also suits you nicely.</font>

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you very much.</font>

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A colleague of mine prepared 
everything for me.</font>

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for my complexion, well, I've learned
some of the struggles women face.</font>

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Prime Minister Karvada, 
there's something I'd like to ask you...</font>

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! Prime Minister Karvada!</font>

work on the recent summoning spell.</font>

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, stop.</font>

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Granted, it was indeed a large-scale spell
 that wouldn't have been possible</font>

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">without the royal sorcery department.</font>

33

 in the purification expedition!</font>

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">More than the third royal order

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,240

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let me introduce you.</font>

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is Seichiro Kondu, assistant director
of the royal accounting department.</font>

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He is a highly capable individual who 
worked hard to hasten the expedition.</font>

40
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, the holy maiden's...</font>

41
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This saves me some trouble.</i></font>

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>A proud noble like him 
should be easy to handle.</i></font>

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-Please excuse me for a moment!</font>

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are you doing?!</font>

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Greet His Excellency!</font>

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I haven't left my research 
laboratory in ten days. I'm starving.</font>

47
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is His Excellency 
Prime Minister Karvada</font>

48
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and Assistant Director Kondu
 from accounting.</font>

49
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Accounting?!</font>

50
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please give us money!</font>

51
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No.</font>

52
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's wrong with you?!
You only just met the man!</font>

53
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Introduce yourself first!</font>

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh... Okay.</font>

55
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't wipe your mouth with your sleeve!</font>

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm Ist, the assistant director 
of the royal sorcery department.</font>

57
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um... Kondu, you're from the 
accounting department, correct?</font>

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal sorcery department 
needs a lot of funding,</font>

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but we don't get much, 
and we're very poor.</font>

60
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So give us money.</font>

61
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ouch!</font>

62
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It seems Zoltan is focused 
on politics as director,</i></font>

63
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>while Ist is a royal sorcerer 
focused on practical matters.</i></font>

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Ow, ow, ow...</font>

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We can't increase your 
budget for no reason.</font>

66
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">However, I could take things into 
consideration if you grant my request.</font>

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you say?</font>

68
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander Indolark...</font>

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama, that hurts.</font>

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-san!</font>

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh?</font>

72
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The holy maiden?</font>

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Holiness. I was informed 
you'd be entering with His Highness.</font>

74
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I-I'm sorry, Camile-san!</font>

75
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't help chasing after Aresh-san. 
He was supposed to enter with us.</font>

76
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, no matter.</font>

77
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should return before 
it causes a commotion.</font>

78
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry. Aresh-san, let's go back.</font>

79
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This event is about Your Holiness
 and the royal family.</font>

80
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've no need of me.</font>

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

82
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Holiness, allow me to attend you.</font>

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with your face?</font>

84
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't understand what you mean.</font>

85
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean <i>your face</i>. And those clothes... 
Where did you get them?</font>

86
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone from my department
 lent them to me.</font>

87
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As for my face, his household maids
painted me with all sorts of things.</font>

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's makeup that's low in magicules, 
so it shouldn't be a problem.</font>

89
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's gotten into you?!</font>

90
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't do your hair in ways 
that make me uneasy!</font>

91
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They put so much effort
 into it and everything!</font>

92
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Whatever. I should get 
away from this guy...</i></font>

93
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The king made his entrance,</i></font>

94
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>expressed concern over the miasma
 from the demon forest,</i></font>

95
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and extolled the sacred ritual
that summoned the holy maiden.</i></font>

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then the holy maiden herself entered, 
escorted by the firstborn prince.</i></font>

97
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Though she sounded a bit hesitant,</i></font>

98
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>she said she wished to do her 
best for everyone in the kingdom.</i></font>

99
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will now announce the 
participants of this expedition.</font>

100
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First, I shall be leading the operation.</font>

101
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So the firstborn prince will be in charge?</i></font>

102
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm sure that'll cause no end of trouble.</i></font>

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Isn't this far more operatives
 than we anticipated?</i></font>

104
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We'll have to revise the budget...</i></font>

105
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

106
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why?</font>

107
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seichiro! I didn't know you 
were joining the expedition.</font>

108
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Will you be all right?</font>

109
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm joining the purification expedition?</font>

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is unthinkable for you.</font>

111
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll speak to His Majesty on your behalf.</font>

112
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even the frail Yua is going.</font>

113
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet a grown man like you
 wants to run away?</font>

114
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It has nothing to do with age or gender.</font>

115
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unlike the holy maiden,
 he has no resistance to magicules.</font>

116
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going somewhere with a high concentration
 of miasma is too dangerous!</font>

117
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's absurd that the one who pushed
 for such a perilous expedition</font>

118
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">gets to stay in the palace, 
comfortable and safe.</font>

119
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He should go himself.</font>

120
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Unlike other people, the risks of the
 demon forest are too great for him!</font>

121
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Highness, I have to agree.</font>

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For him to go to the demon forest 
is tantamount to suicide.</font>

123
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The prince refuses to listen.</i></font>

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He must really hate the fact 
that I rushed the expedition.</i></font>

125
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you joining the expedition, Kondu?</font>

126
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My participation wasn't part of the plan.</i></font>

127
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's why I wanted to connect 
with Ist and ask a favor, but...</i></font>

128
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't deny it would be most efficient 
for me to see the situation for myself.</font>

129
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, I'll go.</font>

130
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The expedition is set
 to depart in three days.</i></font>

131
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The journey there and back will take six.</i></font>

132
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In the precious time we 
have before we leave...</i></font>

133
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I told Nor I wanted to visit his home.</i></font>

134
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>To thank everyone for the clothes
 and makeup they provided, of course,</i></font>

135
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I also had another purpose.</i></font>

136
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Which is why I wanted to speak with Nor's 
adoptive rather than biological father.</i></font>

137
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Nor happily made all the arrangements, 
so I think everything's gone well.</i></font>

138
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Since the banquet,</i></font>

139
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've been busy delegating 
my work to the right people</i></font>

140
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and preparing budget proposals.</i></font>

141
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>All because...</i></font>

142
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiichirou, let's go.</font>

143
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>...of the commander, who drags me 
to the cafeteria every lunch break</i></font>

144
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and picks me up right 
when my work day ends.</i></font>

145
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>My only saving graces are the facts</i></font>

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>that I bring my work home and that
 I can secretly drink nutritional tonics,</i></font>

147
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>because I recover each time 
he casts the barrier spell on me.</i></font>

148
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sei-san, the journey is about an hour
each way, so let's go home tomorrow.</font>

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tomorrow? But my work...</font>

150
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's my family that has 
to arrange for the carriage.</font>

151
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine...</font>

152
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right!</font>

153
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>We have tomorrow off 
for expedition preparations.</i></font>

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll be able to finish the work I brought
 home when I get back tomorrow.</i></font>

155
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where were you?</font>

156
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was out on personal business.</font>

157
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Personal business? 
Right before the expedition?</font>

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard you went out with a 
man from your department.</font>

159
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So he's asking even though 
he knows the answer.</i></font>

160
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He helped me prepare for 
the banquet a few days ago,</font>

161
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so I visited his home to thank his family.</font>

162
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then what's this?</font>

163
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're already going somewhere
 dangerous in such fragile condition,</font>

164
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and you're still working without rest?!</font>

165
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh.</font>

166
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you still feel hot?</font>

167
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No. I'm fine now, so may I return to work?</font>

168
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Absolutely not.</font>

169
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to make sure everything's
 in order for the expedition.</font>

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you want everything in order,
you should put your own health first.</font>

171
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to be more conscious
 of your own weakness.</font>

172
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm well aware.</i></font>

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If it weren't for him,
 I'd die just from breathing.</i></font>

174
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Even a minor scratch would be fatal.</i></font>

175
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I also know that our present relationship
 is strange, even for this world...</i></font>

176
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Besides, I've already prepared expense 
summaries for the second and third orders.</font>

177
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

178
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with that face?</font>

179
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have them on me.</font>

180
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll give them to you tomorrow, 
so do your work then.</font>

181
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I came here to reinforce the 
barrier spell before we sortie.</font>

182
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh...</font>

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was waiting for you to bring it up,</font>

184
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I didn't expect you to go
 on a long two-day trip,</font>

185
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then lock yourself in your room
 to work the day before.</font>

186
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I... do apologize for the trouble.</font>

187
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You and I will depart from here tomorrow.</font>

188
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? You aren't going home?</font>

189
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm not.</font>

190
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's planning on making 
sure I don't work!</i></font>

191
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Home, huh?</i></font>

192
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Commander... Aresh-sama,
 do you have any siblings?</font>

193
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have two older brothers 
and an older sister.</font>

194
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So the unruly, handsome 
commander is the youngest child.</i></font>

195
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Totally expected.</i></font>

196
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hurts.</font>

197
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This</i> hurts? Really?</font>

198
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you all still live at home?</font>

199
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, my older sister has already 
married and left the house.</font>

200
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My second-eldest brother
also lives at his own manor.</font>

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It makes sense for the eldest
 to stay and inherit the estate,</i></font>

202
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but why's this guy still there, too?</i></font>

203
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have a room in the knights' barracks,</font>

204
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but my family home 
is closer to the palace.</font>

205
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's less of a pain, 
so I basically live there.</font>

206
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Group living doesn't suit the 
young master, does it, huh?</i></font>

207
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That hurts.</font>

208
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What about you?</font>

209
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm an only child.</font>

210
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I expected as much.</font>

211
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Given the situation, maybe it 
would be better if I'd had a sibling.</i></font>

212
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was so busy with work that I rarely
 went home for Obon or New Year's.</i></font>

213
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Back in my world,
 with their only son missing,</i></font>

214
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>what's going through my parents' minds?
How are they spending their days?</i></font>

215
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If possible, I hope they take it easy,
expecting I'll come back eventually.</i></font>

216
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just me...</font>

217
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm the only one.</font>

218
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I can't return to my own world,</i></font>

219
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I won't be able to take care 
of them in their old age.</i></font>

220
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If it comes to that,</i></font>

221
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I hope they'll get all the assets 
I left behind without any fuss.</i></font>

222
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>No matter how many times I hear it, 
it sounds like singing.</i></font>

223
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Like a lullaby...</i></font>

224
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The carriage I'll be riding is...</font>

225
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Seiichirou.</font>

226
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're over here.</font>

227
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come again?</font>

228
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Aresh? The tagalong—</font>

229
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, civil official 
is riding horseback?</font>

230
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You already know he has 
no resistance to magicules.</font>

231
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,490

232
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll take care of him.</font>

233
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then what was the point of casting that
barrier so thoroughly on me last night?!</i></font>

234
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wanted to chat with the royal

236
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,930

I've never ridden a horse before.</font>

237
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Due to my frail constitution,</font>

238
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think I could take
a long journey this way.</font>

239
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Stop making that unhappy face just 
because I called you by your title.</i></font>

240
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a problem.</font>

241
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll continually heal you as we go.</font>

242
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So he'll cast barrier

243
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,380

244
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wait, is he serious?</i></font>

245
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on tight.</font>

246
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is it okay for two grown men
to ride this horse together?</font>

247
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not a problem.</font>

252
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

253
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's with that reaction?</font>

254
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,120

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I finally have some time to myself.
 I have to use it wisely.</i></font>

261
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Ouch...</font>

262
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>First, I need to speak with Ist-san...</i></font>

263
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kondou-san!</font>

264
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Nothing ever goes according to plan.</i></font>

265
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kondu?</font>

266
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I have a moment of your time?</font>

267
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The director told me I should 
try to avoid talking to you.</font>

268
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Not the kind of thing you 
should repeat to my face.</i></font>

269
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wanted to discuss a way to increase</font>

270
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">funding for the royal sorcery department, 
as I mentioned at the banquet.</font>

271
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come right in!</font>

272
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He's fundamentally the honest type 
who stays true to his desires.</i></font>

273
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is common among those whose
 hobbies become their line of work.</i></font>

274
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If you know their goals, it's easy to

275
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then there's the difficult type...</i></font>

276
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

277
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tomorrow, please switch places with me!</font>

278
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Isn't it a bodyguard's job to 
discourage this kind of behavior?</i></font>

279
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Hey!</i></font>

280
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that a no?</font>

281
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiraishi-san, do you understand 
the purpose of this expedition?</font>

282
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

283
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Of course I do.</font>

284
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aren't we going in order 
to purify the miasma?</font>

285
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

286
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you are the precious holy maiden, 
the only one who can purify that miasma.</font>

287
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why you're in the same carriage
 that the royal family uses,</font>

288
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and why the knights are providing 
you with full protection.</font>

289
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:56,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whereas I am the person most susceptible
 to the miasma in this world.</font>

290
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, is that because you have 
no resistance to magicules?</font>

291
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's right.</font>

292
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To put it in our world's terms, 
just breathing the outside air weakens me.</font>

293
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yet here I'm going 
somewhere filled with gas</font>

294
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">that would sicken even normal people.</font>

295
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I will most certainly die.</font>

296
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? No way...</font>

297
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Indeed, I will die. Guaranteed.</font>

298
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've already nearly died twice 
since coming to this world.</font>

299
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure you meant nothing
 by your request,</font>

300
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you're increasing

302
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

303
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I didn't mean it like that!</font>

304
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shiraishi-san.</font>

305
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should start considering
 things seriously.</font>

306
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This isn't a world where you 
can just blindly do as you're told</font>

307
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and expect to live peacefully ever after.</font>

308
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:58,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After all, I plan to ruin her 
brilliant future as a holy maiden.</i></font>

309
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard you said something 
to the holy maiden.</font>

310
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where did you get that information?</font>

311
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">From the holy maiden's bodyguard.</font>

312
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I shut him up so that
 His Highness won't find out.</font>

313
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm most grateful for that.</font>

314
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She was visibly down 
during the dinner party.</i></font>

315
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm almost certain it was because of me.</i></font>

316
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But the fact that she came and 
didn't stay holed up in her room</i></font>

317
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>means she must have given 
some thought to what I said.</i></font>

318
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If the holy maiden had skipped the lord's
dinner party while staying at his estate,</i></font>

319
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>it would have been a great insult to him.</i></font>

320
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The firstborn prince, as expected,</i></font>

324
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,680

325
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you had no interest
in the holy maiden.</font>

326
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could I have no interest in her?</font>

327
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

328
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Aresh-sama...</font>

329
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't it about time you 
return to your quarters?</font>

330
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll go back once you stop

331
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not planning on going back?</font>

332
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're not planning on sleeping?</font>

333
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where did you go before dinner?</font>

334
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">To hear reports from the civil officials
 who went out to survey the area.</font>

335
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Before that.</font>

336
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I went to ask some questions for work.</font>

337
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who did you visit?</font>

338
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He must have seen me enter Ist-san's room.</i></font>

339
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If Aresh-sama spreads the word

340
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>this is going to be a headache.</i></font>

341
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you saw me, you should 
have said something.</font>

342
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You completely ignore me or postpone
 things with me while you're working.</font>

343
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I wouldn't be so rude to someone

344
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Except, yeah,

345
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, please! No way.</font>

346
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Guess he's not planning

347
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Well, if that's what it takes to sweep it
under the rug, it's a small price to pay.</i></font>

348
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>On the third day of the expedition, 
we finally approached the demon forest.</i></font>

349
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yua!</font>

350
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all right. Our formation's 
just a bit disorganized.</font>

351
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But didn't you hear animal noises?</font>

352
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everything is fine, Your Holiness.</font>

353
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're close to the source of the miasma,</font>

354
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so the beasts have probably 
grown more ferocious.</font>

355
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In addition to the second

357
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,870

359
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,360

360
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I can cast healing magic, so...</font>

361
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's dangerous. Please refrain

362
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Be at ease.</font>

363
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal medical bureau is also with us.</font>

364
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need only to think 
about the purification.</font>

370
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,940

375
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like that's the last of them.</font>

376
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They don't normally attack 
humans holding weapons.</font>

377
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've grown weaker, too.</font>

378
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I agree.</font>

379
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,190

380
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We will proceed on foot from this point.</font>

381
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The civil officials are to wait here.</font>

382
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,220

383
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold it.</font>
