00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lady Lily, don't go!</font>

134
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll do whatever it takes to stop 
bad things from happening to you!</font>

135
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please...</font>

136
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Oh, what am I to do?</i></font>

137
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How can I safeguard 
these children's futures?</i></font>

138
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I've decided.</i></font>

139
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm going to make...</i></font>

140
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>one last wager.</i></font>

141
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Royal Highness, it's been too long.</font>

142
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I heard you're here to see Cecilia. 
Is there some kind of problem?</font>

143
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you concerned for me?</font>

144
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm only going to visit your own consort.</font>

145
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The crown prince didn't 
marry Cecilia out of love.</i></font>

146
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>He must have had some goal in mind.</i></font>

147
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm certain he's picked up 
on things himself.</i></font>

148
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But nothing has changed yet.</i></font>

149
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:57,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Honestly, what have you been doing for 
eight whole years, you fourth-rate prince?</font>

150
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You haven't given up yet, have you?</font>

151
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I see he's still a crybaby.</i></font>

152
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In that case, allow me to gain you time.</font>

153
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's just like you, Lily!</font>

154
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a marvelous idea!</font>

155
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thank you so much for saying so,
 Your Royal Highness.</font>

156
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought I'd start by repairing 
the church on Leda Street.</font>

157
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good.</font>

158
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Speaking of which, I happened to see 
Your Royal Highness the other day.</font>

159
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodness. Do you really 
think I'd go <i>there</i>?</font>

160
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't believe I said where.</font>

161
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">By the way, do the words "the Holy Grail 
of Eris" mean anything to you?</font>

162
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the event they happen to,</font>

163
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suggest you rethink your plans.</font>

164
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can't afford another 
failure, now can you?</font>

165
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Goodbye.</font>

166
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'm merely a sheltered young noblewoman.</i></font>

167
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I can't stop their plans.</i></font>

168
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But if they think I'll accept defeat, 
they have another think coming.</i></font>

169
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Cecilia and her coconspirators 
said they can't afford to fail.</i></font>

170
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>So I'll make use of that fact.</i></font>

171
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I'll make them think their secret 
is out and delay their plots.</i></font>

172
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I gave them a glimpse of my fake key 
in order to mislead them.</i></font>

173
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If I manage to get away, 
their misconception will become truth.</i></font>

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The real truth, as far as I know it, 
is in the museum.</i></font>

175
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>"Destroy the Holy Grail of Eris."</i></font>

176
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I couldn't manage it,</i></font>

177
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>but I'll let someone else 
take it from here.</i></font>

178
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Someone alive in the future.</i></font>

179
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How haughty and proud they'll have to be 
to dare look down on the gods,</i></font>

180
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>and how unbelievably softhearted 
to risk everything for someone else.</i></font>

181
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>It will take a miracle for 
someone like that to come along.</i></font>

182
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But what's wrong with 
believing in miracles?</i></font>

183
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>They haven't come. I won my wager.</i></font>

184
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Till the very end,</i></font>

185
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:40,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I didn't understand how Scarlett 
could smile like that back then.</i></font>

186
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But now I'm glad that she did.</i></font>

187
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's right.</i></font>

188
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If Scarlett can do it, 
then, naturally, so can I.</i></font>

189
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>After all...</i></font>

190
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Lily Orlamunde has always hated to lose.</i></font>

191
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then this means the Holy Grail of Eris</font>

192
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">is a Farisian military operation... 
to invade Adelbide.</font>

193
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"In closing, to whoever finds this letter,</font>

194
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I place the future in your hands."</font>

195
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's placed the future in our hands, huh?</font>

196
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder what we can actually do with it.</font>

197
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, got a minute?</font>

198
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A-Amelia!</font>

199
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shh! Not so loud.</font>

200
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm dead meat if <i>she</i> finds out 
I'm still in the country.</font>

201
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She who?</font>

202
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here.</font>

203
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is everything I dug up 
on Crown Princess Cecilia.</font>

204
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Make good use of it.</font>

205
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And there you have it.</font>

206
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At a glance, Cecilia's mother 
was a prostitute.</font>

207
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kevin Jennings found out 
and developed a crippling drug addiction,</font>

208
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and was placed in Saint Nicholas Hospital,
 run by Cecilia's charity.</font>

209
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What would Crown Princess Cecilia 
want with a hospital?</font>

210
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is only a guess, but perhaps 
she was testing Jackal's Paradise.</font>

211
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In the name of "treatment."</font>

212
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Earl Campbell used 
to oversee that hospital,</font>

213
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he's linked to Cecilia by 
Simon Darkian, Deborah's husband.</font>

214
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Her</i> husband?</font>

215
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Enrique, Cecilia, the Darkians,
 Daeg Gallus, those sly Farisian dogs...</font>

216
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's gotten so convoluted I don't know 
who to exact my revenge on anymore!</font>

217
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Won't <i>someone</i> think of me for a change?!</font>

218
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:09,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If this is how it is, I'll thrash everyone
who had anything to do with my execution!</font>

219
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>W-Wait a minute!</i></font>

220
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How does she expect to "thrash" 
all those eminent personages?</i></font>

221
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Reports on a ten-year-old investigation?</font>

222
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}You're after the truth behind 
Scarlett Castiel's execution, I suppose?</font>

223
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear your fiancée 
has been poking around.</font>

224
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Come now. Don't you scowl at me.</font>

225
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am your superior officer, remember? 
And commandant, at that.</font>

226
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm a real important fellow.</font>

227
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Say something already.</font>

228
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I can see why you'd be curious.</font>

229
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That reminds me...</font>

230
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Weren't you accused of treason</font>

231
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and nearly executed yourself 
around that time?</font>

232
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Faris we ought to worry about now.</font>

233
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have you learned anything 
about the missing seventh prince?</font>

234
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, although I tried to probe the head 
of their delegation, Kendall Levine.</font>

235
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whatever do you mean?</font>

236
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He seems disinclined 
to make the matter public.</font>

237
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

238
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:32,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Their king is bedridden due to illness, 
and I hear rumors of a succession dispute.</font>

239
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's not all.</font>

240
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Faris is reminting coins.</font>

241
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Gunpowder, iron, and wagon production 
are growing rapidly as well.</font>

242
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It sounds like they're preparing for war.</font>

243
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right. And if so, it'll be war 
with us here in Adelbide.</font>

244
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do they have a casus belli?</font>

245
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Proper justification?
 They could easily trump something up.</font>

246
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They've always had a knack 
for that kind of maneuvering.</font>

247
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But we won't give them the chance.</font>

248
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That is the duty of those 
whose lives were spared.</font>

249
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I looked over all 
the investigation reports, but...</font>

250
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello there.</font>

251
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fancy meeting you again, Holy Grail Girl.</font>

252
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I beg your pardon?</font>

253
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Miss Grail, isn't it?</font>

254
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pardon her. "Grail" is synonymous 
with "holy grail" in Old Farish.</font>

255
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You come from Faris, then?</font>

256
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you must be Earl Randolph Ulster.</font>

257
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We're here today to speak with you.</font>

258
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How do you know my name?</font>

259
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I hear you were most attentive 
to our dear Kendall.</font>

260
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:56,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">His Royal Highness Ulysses, Seventh Prince
 of Faris, was abducted in Adelbide.</font>

261
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:03,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Faris will use retribution to justify 
declaring war on your country.</font>

262
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's—</font>

263
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All staged.</font>

264
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Daeg Gallus did the abducting.</font>

265
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're pulling the strings
 from backstage.</font>

266
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then who are you?</font>

267
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We come from Faris, sure enough. Only...</font>

268
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her Royal Highness Alexandria,
 Third Princess of Faris, sent us.</font>

269
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't want war.</font>

270
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't...?</font>

271
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please, will you work with us
 to stop this war?</font>

272
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's all as Lily wrote in her letter.</font>

273
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, um, why did the plan ten years ago...</font>

274
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did the Holy Grail of Eris fail?</font>

275
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean you don't know?</font>

276
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It failed because Scarlett Castiel 
was executed.</font>

277
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So that's what this is.</font>

278
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Have you finished building your hand?</font>

279
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your Grace,</font>

280
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett's mother was 
Aliénore Shibola, was she not?</font>

281
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She was a lineal descendant of 
Cornelia of the Starry Crown,</font>

282
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">the last ruler of the vast empire 
that Faris once was.</font>

283
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The royal family of Adelbide 
possesses reddish-violet eyes,</font>

284
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">while Farisian royals 
have bluish-violet eyes.</font>

285
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:39,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And amethyst eyes, blending red and blue, 
have a special significance in Faris.</font>

286
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The true goal of 
the Holy Grail of Eris was most likely</font>

287
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to install a descendant 
of the old imperial family,</font>

288
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Scarlett Castiel, on Adelbide's throne</font>

289
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and transform us 
into a vassal state of Faris.</font>

290
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But Scarlett was executed
 a decade ago, foiling the plot.</font>

291
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Her death saved Adelbide 
from being murdered in its sleep.</font>

292
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But perhaps...</font>

293
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">someone ensured events 
would play out that way.</font>

294
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In other words, my execution 
was my father's doing.</font>

295
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Adelbide avoided its fate with Faris 
thanks to my timely death.</font>

296
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">My father would think nothing of 
sacrificing his daughter for his country.</font>

297
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Duke Castiel did that?!</font>

298
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could anyone... be so cruel?</font>

299
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Scarlett!</font>

300
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go see Duke Castiel right now.</font>

301
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He isn't the kind of man 
you can simply go visit.</font>

302
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If today doesn't work, 
there's always tomorrow.</font>

303
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He's bound to see us eventually 
if we only keep trying.</font>

304
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I'm going to call on the duke today.</font>

305
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

306
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll arrange a meeting for you.</font>

307
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We appreciate Your Grace's generosity 
in granting us this audience.</font>

308
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">May I introduce my fiancée, 
Constance Grail.</font>

309
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's a pleasure to meet you.</font>

310
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now then, my sincere young lady, 
what would you like to ask me?</font>

311
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was it Your Grace who sent 
Scarlett to the scaffold?</font>
