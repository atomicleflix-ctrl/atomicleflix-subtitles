59
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,050

60
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,460

65
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,000

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">people would get the idea that they can 
get out of any crime just by paying money.</font>

67
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That would make the prevention 
of crime more difficult.</font>

68
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And since only the wealthy 
would be able to afford the fines—</font>

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">major merchants, nobles, and 
government officials—</font>

70
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it would eventually breed 
corruption in our government.</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You dislike it?</font>

79
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,000

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why not allow people to pay money</font>

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">not to escape punishment, 
but to attain honor?</font>

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For example, those who donate 
a thousand rean to the empire</font>

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">may be granted honorary knighthood.</font>

84
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It will need caveats to ensure it 
can't be abused to gain real power,</font>

85
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but many would love to be granted such 
an honor by Your Majesty personally.</font>

87
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>come into possession of more 
money than they can use,</i></font>

88
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>they begin to desire honor more 
than physical possessions.</i></font>

89
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see. What a brilliant idea.</font>

90
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You impress me, Noah.</font>

92
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,750

93
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,710

344
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">when he seemed so nonchalant

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh... Yes, exactly!</font>

346
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,120

353
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He can't get mad if the younger 
brother apologizes first.</font>

354
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not to mention my brother disavowed Dalem
and the slave traders with such ease.</font>

355
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I'd done nothing, I'd become 
a target for harassment.</font>

356
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Behind the curtain,
he sees me as an enemy.</font>

357
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I apologized, and he accepted it.</font>

358
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Among nobles, rehashing a problem
previously apologized for is unseemly.</font>

362
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one showing 
them in? How unusual.</font>

363
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,300

364
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All right.</font>

367
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,760

368
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,570

handled yesterday's incident.</font>

369

me to work under you as well.</font>

370
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Me? But our jurisdictions are different.</font>

371
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A member of the Ministry of the Imperial
Household would struggle here.</font>

372
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mind.</font>

373
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You can simply use me 
whenever you have the need.</font>

374
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Very well.</font>

375
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,490
